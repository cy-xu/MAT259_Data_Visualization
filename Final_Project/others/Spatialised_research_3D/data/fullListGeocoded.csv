Global and International Studies",Global and International Studies,Richard Appelbaum,"As billions of dollars are being invested in construction, construction workers are the physical driving force behind the UAE's infrastructural development and overall growth. Despite being an integral component to decreasing the dependence on oil rents and diversifying the economy through construction, workers in this industry are severely mistreated. This study seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of workers' rights in the construction industry in the UAE. The central research question framing this study is: what are the labor violations faced by workers and to what degree has the UAE government responded to these issues? The follow up questions are then, have working conditions improved and what are the challenges in improving these conditions? This study employs a qualitative approach, drawing on current literature in order to answer the central research questions. The discussion in this paper is based on an analysis of the information collected through archival research and is divided into 7 chapters. The penultimate chapter of this thesis features a case study of Abu Dhabi's $27 billion megaproject, Saayidat Island, which is home to the new Guggenheim, Louvre, and New York University (NYU) satellite campus. This current case study will be used in order to examine the status of workers' rights violations and the level of enforcement of government policy on labor issues. After a review of government policy on labor, this paper concludes that the UAE does not lack legislation on labor issues, but rather lacks enforcement of these laws. Thus, this study finds that the largest hurdles to enforcing labor laws is the level of crony capitalism between the government and the construction industry and the disposability of labor. This study hypothesizes that the partnerships Abu Dhabi is building with big international names at Saayidat Island, like the Guggenheim and Louvre museums and also universities like New York University, may serve as a tipping point and bring more international scrutiny to violations of workers' rights in this industry. The hope is that mounting international pressure, as seen in Qatar leading up to the 2022 World Cup, will encourage the UAE to go beyond responding to these issues at the institutional level and motivate them to enforce the labor laws on the ground. In the 1960s the United Arab Emirates (UAE) struck oil. Over the years, the UAE has increasingly invested in an array of sectors to reduce economic dependence on hydrocarbon exports. All sectors that the UAE is actively investing in, are not only global but require infrastructure development. Between the Emirates of Dubai and Abu Dhabi there are currently about 1,300 construction projects in development worth over $418 billion (Sonmez et al., 2011). The Emirates lack the domestic labor force required to support these construction endeavors. For this reason, the UAE is largely dependent on migrant labor.",Abu Dhabi,54.3773,24.4539,1

Sociology",Sociology,"William I. Robinson, Juan-Vicente Palerm","This dissertation examines the interplay between processes of globalization and transnational migration and their impact at the micro level in the understudied area of gendered household economic strategies in both sending and receiving communities. Drawing on a multi-sited ethnography study which employed a two-phase mixed methods approach, I analyzed migration histories, occupational mobility, migration dispersion in the U.S., and household economic strategies, in two transnational communities: 1) Acayahualco, Guerrero Mexico and Santa Barbara, CA and 2) Mayanalan, Guerrero Mexico and Wilmington, DE. To ascertain key socio-demographic features of the populations under study, I developed a 162-item survey that I administered to 90 households in the sending communities of Guerrero, Mexico. The survey results were both complemented and challenged by my multi-sited ethnographic research comprising 50 in-depth interviews, along with participant observation in the sending and receiving communities. This study offers two contributions to sociology: in the one hand it examines the ways in which globalization takes place at the local level, specifically in the social context of international migration. By undertaking this type of dialectic analysis of the global and the local, this study sheds light on the individual's response capabilities and, more importantly, on their agency power in the face of global processes. This proactive agency on the part of the transnational migrant families becomes evident as they are observed looking constantly for ways to ""stretch their limited resources"" to cover expenses by relying on their unlimited resourcefulness. In this context, international migration should not be viewed simply as a survival strategy for peasant families, but, as a mechanism of reaction and resistance against global capitalism barriers. On the other hand, I demonstrated throughout this work, the social phenomenon of international migration in these two communities, and within their domestic units, is the result of an accumulative and uninterrupted process that has been shaped by a vast number of learning experiences, social and cultural exchanges, and innovative and resourceful practices to cope with the challenges of becoming transnational. The transnational perspective allows us to underscore how, in spite of being physically separated by great distances, the development of household economic strategies by migrants and their families are deeply linked. This transnational linkage allows migrants and their families in their communities of origins to cope with the challenges of a globalized economy that has been detrimental to their living conditions. In this sense, the results of my study counter the view that sees migrants and their families in their communities of origin as puppets controlled by forces beyond their own control. Rather, this study emphasizes how migrants and their families with hard-working ethics look for opportunities to improve their socioeconomic circumstances and enhance their living conditions.",Acayahualco,-99.4818991,18.2268164,1

Geography, Joint Program SDSU","Geography, Joint Program SDSU","John R. Weeks, David Lopez-Carr","Health in the developing world is becoming particularly complex due to disparate economic and environmental contexts residing in close spatial proximity, each paving the way for widely different environmental health hazards resulting in acute and chronic illness. In navigating this increasingly heterogeneous landscape, children in Accra, Ghana face multiple types of environmental health hazards as they travel from home, to school, to friends' houses, and to visit family. A child-in-home, or even child-in-neighborhood model of third world urban health hazards cannot account for the complexity of hazards and health threats faced by children on a daily basis. Yet children in Accra, particularly as they move out of their especially vulnerable early years, manage to navigate and mitigate health hazards. Little is known about how children perceive environmental health hazards: their spatially situated knowledge of hazards within daily environments may lead to a better understanding of how space and place drive human-environment health interactions. Furthermore, numerous studies have demonstrated that children in both the developed and developing world are acting with increased agency regarding health. This research proposes to advance the health geography, environmental health, and health education literature by working with children from three diverse contextual backgrounds in a developing third world city to examine verbal, visual, and spatial perceptions of health and environmental health hazards. The dissertation does this by establishing baseline differences of children and adult's perceptions of children's health, testing child-friendly visual methods of assessing health knowledge, and developing a novel method of assessing spatial patterns of health perceptions through GPS and photography. Results indicate that children in Accra have distinct, and often varying, perceptions of health when compared to adults and across socioeconomic groups. Photographic methods that contextualize health are good measures of health knowledge and perceptions. Furthermore, placing health perceptions in space as children move through the environment sheds light on spatial properties of health perceptions, such as health related landmarks, and regional categorization of spaces into healthy and unhealthy places.",Accra,-0.1869644,5.6037168,2

Geography, Joint Program SDSU","Geography, Joint Program SDSU",John R. Weeks,"Intraurban differentials in safe drinking water in developing cities have been exacerbated by rapid population growth that exceeds expansion of local water infrastructure. In Accra, Ghana, municipal water is rationed to meet demand, and the gap in water services is increasingly being filled by private water vendors selling packaged ""sachet"" water. Private sector sale of sachet water has grown to fill an important gap in household water security, and consumption of sachet water has been on the rise in West Africa over the last decade. Sachets extend drinking water coverage deeper into low-income areas and alleviate the need for safe water storage. This potentially introduces a health benefit over stored tap water, but at an additional cost both financially and environmentally. The long-term implications of these changing consumption patterns remain unclear. This work begins by reviewing recent shifts in drinking water sources from recent Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys, as well as the history, economics, quality, and regulation of sachet water in Ghana's Accra-Tema Metropolitan Area. It proceeds to explore correlates of using sachets as the primary drinking water source for two large samples of women drawn from separate household surveys in Accra, and investigates links between sachet water and reported diarrhea episodes in a subset of children under five. Within Accra's slums, neighborhood water rationing and lower socioeconomic status tend to increase a household's likelihood of buying sachet water, and sachet customers tend to be the poorest of the poor. Sachet use is also associated with higher levels of self-reported overall health in women, and lower likelihood of diarrhea in children. More broadly, after controlling for all socioeconomic groups in Accra, sachet use is associated with younger age, lower overall health, and neighborhood water rationing. Sachet water consumption also seems to have transitioned from an initial luxury good of the rich to a widespread phenomenon of the urban poor between 2008 and 2010. Given the pros and cons of sachet water, a more holistic understanding of the drinking water landscape is necessary for municipal planning and sustainable drinking water provision.",Accra,-0.1869644,5.6037168,2

While these issues are certainly exacerbated by the austere operational climate of the region itself, referring to ongoing conflict, government capacity and legitimacy limitations, and economic instability, they should more accurately be understood as symptomatic of greater structural contradictions within contemporary ""development"" paradigms. The future success or failure of Afghanistan's economic recovery will depend on the international aid community's ability to aggressively reform its aid goals and success indicators, facilitate domestic institutional agency in establishing and realizing development goals, and definitively separating aid goals and operations from military ones.",Afghanistan,67.709953,33.93911,2

Geography",Geography,Oliver A. Chadwick,"Global anthropogenic desiccation of lake basins in arid and semi-arid areas result in substantial increases in the flux of aeolian material. In California, Owens Lake playa has produced a tremendous amount of windblown dust since its desiccation in the early 20th century. In view of the potential danger to human health of the dust blowing off the playa, the chemistry and mineralogy of playa sediments and dust are well known. By contrast, the impact of the dust on surrounding soils and ecosystems in Owens Valley has been less well studied. This dissertation documents the accumulation of dust-derived salts from Owens Lake playa in nearby alluvial soils sourced from Sierra Nevada granite. I evaluate patterns of electrical conductivity (EC), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), and pH as proxies of salt incorporation with respect to depth in the soil profiles and with distance from the playa. I use two different approaches to determine whether salts measured in soils are derived from playa dust: arsenic (As) and ionic ratios of sodium (Na), lithium (Li), and calcium (Ca) to other major soil cations; and Sr isotopic ratios of 87Sr/86Sr. These are the first data to document the fate of Owens Lake playa dust in surrounding alluvial soils. Results indicate that playa dust is the source of salt levels found in soils more than 20 km away. More importantly, soils in direct proximity of the playa show a significant impact from playa-derived salt input. Based on extremely elevated salt levels in soils on the playa side of the nearby Alabama Hills, topography and variable wind-flow directions have important effects on sites downwind of dust sources; and these factors may be more important than mere distance from the playa in influencing the impact of salt-rich dust on soils along the Sierra Nevada alluvial piedmont. An evaluation of the severity of the impact of the playa dust on soils is a critical step toward assessing management decisions related to Owens Lake playa as well as many other lake basins that are rapidly desiccating under human influence.",Alabama,-86.902298,32.3182314,5

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Alexander R. Simms,"Recent studies along the northwestern Gulf of Mexico document rapid back-stepping of estuarine environments of up to 20 km and 150 m/yr at ca. 8.2 thousand years ago (ka), 4.8, ka, and 2.6 ka. If such rapid changes in coastal environments occurred today along the urbanized coast of the Gulf of Mexico major economical and ecological loss would occur. Of these three backstepping events, only one can be tied to a known cause---the 8.2 ka event related to a rapid increase in the rate of relative sea-level rise. However, the cause of the latter two, the 4.8 and 2.6 ka events are largely unknown. To determine the relative roles of changes in sea level and climate in these two events, paleo sea-level (Chapter 2), climate (Chapter 3), and stratigraphic records (Chapter 4) are presented from upper Baffin Bay, Texas and neighboring playa Laguna Salada. As commonly used high-resolution sea-level indicators are absent from the southern Texas Coast, a new sea-level indicator is needed. I test the use of intertidal microbial mats in reconstructing Holocene sea levels from Baffin, Bay Texas (Chapter 2). The indicative range of microbial mats is +/-0.29 m, much less than the +/-2 m indicative range of typical sea-level indicators currently used along the semiarid Texas coast. The elevations of 22 buried radiocarbon-dated microbial mats plot within error of relative sea-level data derived from the central Texas coast for the past 5.0 ky indicating that microbial mats provide a robust proxy for paleo--sea levels along semiarid and arid coastlines. The high-resolution microbial mat relative sea-level record derived from the tectonically stable central Texas coast also provides a test of recently proposed Holocene Highstands based on emergent coastal deposits in Texas and Alabama. The microbial mat relative sea-level data, similar to relative sea-level data derived from Mississippi Delta basal peats and lower-resolution Texas estuarine bivalves, indicates an ever-decreasing rate of relative sea-level rise since ca. 5.0 ka and precludes the possibility of Holocene Highstands in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Paleoclimate records are also sparse along the southern Texas coast. A new quantitative drought proxy is derived from a transfer function between X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) elemental data from a Texas playa and a tree-ring drought record (Chapter 3). Using this transfer function, a 954-year tree-ring drought record was extended to ca. 3,000 ka. Ba, Br, and Pb were utilized as predictor variables. Machine learning algorithms, utilized to derive the transfer function, had maximum validation accuracies of 94%. Changes in the extended drought record correspond with the timing of the Roman Climate Optimum, Medieval Warm Period, Little Ice Age, and changes in North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SST). Increased drought frequency is coeval with nearby dune migration ca. 0.2 ka, 1.9 ka, and 2.6 ka. The highest drought frequency in the record occurs during the Medieval Warm Period ca. 1.0 ka followed by a decrease in drought frequency during the Little Ice Age ca. 0.4 ka. Increased drought frequency accompanies increased North Atlantic SST since 3 ka. This trend of warm North Atlantic SST and dry conditions over the study area follows secular meteorological observations and tree-ring records. These results indicate that lacustrine derived XRF element data can be used as a quantitative tool to reconstruct past drought records, and that North Atlantic SST modulated drought in southern Texas for the last 3,000 years. Within Baffin Bay, five flooding surfaces making periods of abrupt environmental change, between 1.1--1.0 ka, 2.7--2.1 ka, 3.8--3.0 ka, 5.2--4.9 ka, and 6.5--5.7 ka occur through a time-period of ever decreasing rates of relative sea-level rise and within error of periods of drying in southern Texas at ca. 1.0 ka, 2.6 ka, 3.4 ka, 4.8 ka, and 5.5 ka (Chapter 4). I hypothesize that these flooding surfaces, occurring when sea level in the Gulf of Mexico was rising < 2 mm/yr, and during independently documented drying events, were primarily driven by changes in climate through declines in fluvial sediment supply to the coast.",Alabama,-86.902298,32.3182314,5

Economics",Economics,Christopher Costello,"Problems arising from the common-pool nature of fisheries are well known (Gordon 1954). Recent research estimates the lost economic benefits from suboptimal fisheries production to be on the order of $50 billion annually (Arnason et al. 2009). Among the most promising management tools for improving fisheries performance are closed areas (marine reserves) and rights-based management (catch shares) (Worm et al. 2009). This collection of essays examines the emergence and performance of these two policy tools from an economics perspective. The first chapter examines the determinants of the transition from command and control regulation to rights-based management in common-pool resources. I develop a conceptual framework describing a regulator's decision to adopt a rights-based management regime in a common-pool resource and empirically test the hypotheses advanced in the framework with a duration analysis of rights-based management program adoption in a group of federally managed Alaska fisheries. Consistent with the conceptual framework, I find that rent dissipation along input cost and product value dimensions increases likelihood of program adoption, and high transaction costs decrease likelihood of program adoption. I find mixed evidence that resource depletion increases probability of program adoption. The second chapter examines the capacity of marine reserves to function as a cooperation mechanism in transboundary fisheries, stocks shared by two or more jurisdictions. Using a game theoretic model, we find that marine reserve implementation can achieve first-best equilibrium economic outcomes. We illustrate our theoretical predictions with a case study of the Chilean loco fishery. The third chapter estimates the economic and biological outcomes of the implementation of a marine reserve network at the California Channel Islands in 2003 on the Santa Barbara Area red sea urchin fishery. The paper develops an integrated bioeconomic model of the fishery consisting of an age structured population model and a discrete choice model of fishermen behavior linked via the fishing mortality rate. We calibrate the model using a 15-year panel dataset of fishery data and use the calibrated model to simulate outcomes under a counterfactual no-reserve scenario. We find that eight years after reserve implementation, urchin biomass is 53.7% higher, fishery yield is 11.3% lower, and fishery revenue is 10.9% lower compared to simulated outcomes under a counterfactual no-reserve policy.",Alaska,-149.4936733,64.2008413,2

Furthermore, levels of amenity-related employment at one point in time can be strong predictors of median home prices several years later, although they proved less useful for predicting the percentage change in median home values over time. Amenity-related employment may therefore be a potentially useful indicator to consider when predicting median home values. These findings also open up avenues for future research into the applicability of the consumer-city hypothesis in other First World countries as well as the developing world. The rise of the modern service- and information-based economy has accompanied an increased concern for quality of life compared to earlier eras. The consumer city hypothesis argues that in a post-industrial society, people increasingly value the location-specific amenities a particular city has to offer when deciding where to live. This is in contrast to traditional wisdom, which holds that jobs are the sole or most important criterion in attracting people to a given place. While other studies have found an association between natural amenities and greater demand for places that have them, there is much less work focusing on whether cultural amenities have the same effect. This analysis aims to discover whether there is additional evidence to support the consumer city hypothesis by investigating the relationship between cultural amenity levels (as measured by employment in amenity-related fields) and demand for particular places (as measured by median home prices). This study examines 357 Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the United States (including those in Alaska and Hawaii). Data from the American Community Survey and the Bureau of Labor Statistics were used to measure amenity-related employment, median home prices, and other demographic variables. Four linear regressions were run to determine the relationship between these variables in the years 2012 and 2005, as well as to discover the predictive value of amenity-related employment for future median home prices and changes in median home prices over time.",Alaska,-149.4936733,64.2008413,2

History of Art and Architecture",History of Art and Architecture,Edson Armi,"A sense of spatial expansiveness develops, born from an increasing ease with being a water-based state, from the eleventh century on, evidenced in a redefinition of the Piazza San Marco in terms of its connection, both physically and ceremonially with the lagoon. Shifting from the ninth and tenth century concerns with the definition of perimeters and the need for defense of the lagoon, what emerges, in tandem with growing Venetian trade, is an emphasis on the Piazza representing the city-state as an imperium. Already a more amorphous entity to define because of the city being surrounded by the lagoon, it is only step away to begin to identify with more distant bodies of water. At first at ease within the Po and Brenta river networks, the Venetians expand to establish control of the upper Adriatic followed by their dominance in the entire area of the sea. From its inception as a small apron-space in the ninth century to the thirteenth century's enlarged and ornamented civic square, how has the Piazza San Marco been used and how has it served a variety of people's interests? If examined over time, can its transforming contours and usage contribute to an historical study of how Venetians saw themselves and imagined their city relating to the larger world? What is uncovered, in the historical view of it as a civic space, is that priorities and values did change according to Venice's perceived relationship to the region and to the Mediterranean world. If the ninth century inception, eleventh century reconstruction, twelfth century expansion, and thirteenth century enrichment of the Piazza are studied, in the light of its physical amendments and its usage, it is apparent that Venetian ideas about limits, borders and boundaries are transforming. It is only a matter of time and of opportunity, before dominion is extended to a strategic chain of entrepots in the Mediterranean and mare nostrum, itself, seems an extension of the Venetian lagoon. Methods used in this study included site visits for measurement and observation and the study of archival records and chronicles. Great use was made of reports on the limited archaeological work that has been done on Rive Alto as well as the lively debate and scholarship reflected in the voluminous secondary work. The un-built zones or ""openings"" in the urban fabric of cities change over time, revealing changes in priorities, circumstances and social values. Civic spaces particularly reflect transforming attitudes and commitments. The Piazza San Marco, in Venice, Italy, is a fitting example of an urban zone that has been, up to the present, a pivotal meeting place.

However, with some important exceptions (e.g., DeArmond and Goldhaber, 2010) limited research has focused upon perceptions of teachers who receive these pension plans. As such, the purpose of this study was to describe and analyze the degree to which teachers' perceptions of their understanding of retirement, sufficiency of retirement, and preference for defined benefit may contribute to retirement satisfaction, career satisfaction, and openness to changing the retirement system. A survey design was used to gather data from teachers in three California districts. Nearly 230 teachers submitted usable surveys. Factor analyses were used to confirm both independent and dependent variables of study. Four factors emerged related to independent variables: understanding of retirement, sufficiency of retirement, preference for defined benefit, and preference for personal retirement control. Five factors emerged related to dependent variables: retirement satisfaction, personal career satisfaction, compensation satisfaction, openness to major system change, and openness to strengthening the retirement system. Among the findings were that teachers' perceptions of understanding of retirement, sufficiency of retirement, and preference for personal retirement control were all significant predictors of retirement satisfaction. Furthermore, perceptions of sufficiency of retirement were a significant predictor of compensation satisfaction. Preference for defined benefit and preference for personal retirement control were both significant predictors for openness to major system change. This finding indicated that teachers' preference for defined benefit had a negative predictive effect on openness to major system change. In addition, those preferring personal retirement control had a positive effect on openness to major system change. Analyzing teachers by experience showed that teachers with high experience (more than 15 years) had a higher satisfaction of retirement, understanding of retirement, and preference for defined benefit than less experienced teachers. Contrastingly, lower experience teachers had a higher openness to major system change and a higher preference for personal retirement control. These differences suggest that experienced teachers are generally more satisfied and content with their retirement but newer teachers are likely more open to potential system overhauls being considered within the state studied.",Amo,-86.6136129,39.6881019,1

History of Art and Architecture",History of Art and Architecture,Ann Jensen Adams,"Traditions informing the deceptions perpetrated by seventeenth-century trompe-l'oeil paintings shine considerable light on the behavior of seventeenth-century artists, patrons, and viewers in unexpected ways. This study considers illusionistic paintings and written accounts of those experiencing them in the seventeenth century in conjunction with non-art historical scientific, philosophical, and social discourses of the period concerned with the subject of deceit. Questions on naturalism that remain a central subject in Netherlandish History of Art and Architecture are elaborated upon, for, when considered deceptive, artists and their paintings reveal a variety of intriguing concerns. From this perspective, this dissertation argues that artists and their patrons fostered viewing responses that are surprisingly ideological with wide-ranging political and intellectual ramifications dependent on the immediate contexts in which they were made. To lie well, particularly in such a way that revealed the clever machinations of the deceit and established the participants' mastery of the subtleties of a given set of values, was a highly-desirable social and political achievement. Beautifully painted lies facilitated this exploration of deception. The complicity of original sites of trompe-l'oeil reception in the deceptive act -- in physical locations like artists' studios, churches, town halls, homes, and the marketplace -- was determined by attitudes to deceit specific to these contexts. A painting that lies will encourage very different responses determined by the expectations of the participants. The place of deception in the visual arts, and painting in particular, was a practice informed by professional concerns, art theory, and economic pursuits favored by seventeenth-century Netherlandish artists. The production of illusionistic painting by the artist Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts for the Danish kings in the 1660s and 70s in particular terms of the complimentary goals of an emerging absolutist court and of the knowledge-producing system of a kunstkammer. Alternatively, two illusionistically painted organ screens painted for prominent churches in Amsterdam, one by Cornelis Brise and the other by Gerard de Lairesse, provides an entirely different set of responses within a context dominated by Protestant concerns and contemporaneous controversies. In this environment, the delicate balance between morally proscribed lies and the activation of compelling visual deceptions underscores the visual appeal of trompe-l'oeil art of this period. The trompe-l'oeil paintings of Samuel van Hoogstraten and several of his contemporaries produced deceptive imagery for middle-class and royal patrons in Restoration England. Analysis of the written experiences of the bureaucrat Samuel Pepys with their illusions, serves as a means of accessing the social pressures and intellectual pursuits that responded to, and in turn informed, artistic production. By expanding the cultural referents of deception to include those determined by the immediate contexts for which trompe-l'oeil paintings were made, our understanding of a seemingly homogenous sub-genre is made far more complicated and versatile.",Amsterdam,4.8951679,52.3702157,1

Chicana and Chicano Studies",Chicana and Chicano Studies,"Miroslava Chavez-Garcia, Dolores I. Casillas","My research examines early twentieth-century immigration policies focusing on the experience of ""repatriation"" that tore apart Mexican and Mexican American families throughout the United States. It considers this historical moment as the ""banishment"" of U.S. citizens of Mexican descent to foreground the difference between repatriation, which implies that the person is not a citizen of a given country and banishment, referring to citizens who are banned from their home country. This discursive difference challenges much of the literature that refers to these banishments as ""repatriations"", obscuring the systematic racist and exclusionist immigration policies. The legal, social, and cultural ramifications of banishment on second and third generation descendants of U.S. citizens are largely absent in Chicana/o-Latina/o historiographies and immigration legal studies. My work takes an innovative approach in that it focuses on the prolonged consequences of immigration policies on surviving banished U.S. citizens and their descendants and the link to today's growing legally mixed-status households across the United States. My study demonstrates that U.S. immigration policies continue to ignore the long and complex Mexico-U.S. immigration relations, failing to create adequate paths to legalization for old and new generations of Mexican immigrants. This study centers on the experiences of banishment of three extended families and uses their oral histories across multiple generations to recover and rewrite the history of forced exclusion. The families are composed of surviving U.S. citizens who were banished during the early twentieth century and/or who are descendants of those survivors who have returned to the United States, some as undocumented immigrants. The participating families include the Yanez family, residing in Anaheim, California; the Molina family, spread throughout California, Alabama, and Mexico; and the Robles family, living in Pasadena, California. To allow for personal accounts as well as communal- or family-based interpretations, each family member is interviewed individually and then the entire family is interviewed collectively, providing for a multiplicity of insights and richly texture points of views. In addition to oral histories, this study mines the families' archives, which are composed of photographs, letters, and legal records detailing the experiences of banishment over the course of the twentieth century. Institutional records, including legal histories, archival materials, and demographic data housed at the National Archives in Washington D.C. and the regional branches in Los Angeles, California, as well as El Paso, Texas are used to contextualize the primary research and to reconstruct and reinterpret the immigration policies of the time. My study indicates that these families experienced repatriation in very unique ways, but with a common sense of contempt that extends across family generations, and continue to face real legal and social collateral consequences. My findings demonstrate that an almost 90-year-old unofficial, later becoming official, policy continues to classify direct descendents of banished U.S. citizens as ""illegal"" immigrants in their parents and grandparents' home country. Banishment has resulted in what I term, a transgenerational illegality, which has been nearly impossible to shake. These findings are crucial at a time where immigration remains central to national debates. The twenty original oral histories collected for this study demonstrate that, despite the subjugation of these families, the descendants found ways to challenge their ""illegal"" status, giving rise to the concept of a contested illegality..",Anaheim,-117.9143012,33.8365932,1

This is especially true for California's Channel Islands, where forests are frequently shaded by low-lying clouds or immersed in fog during warm and dry summer months. Previous studies suggest that clouds strongly modulate forest distributions as well as carbon and water budgets in these semi-arid environments by reducing solar insolation and raising relative humidity and thus reducing evapotranspiration, while also potentially supplying water directly to the landscape from fog-drip. While summertime fog and stratus cover in California's Channel Islands can ameliorate summer drought stress and enhance soil water budgets, they often have different spatial and temporal patterns. These differing patterns and the resulting shifts in relative ecological importance of fog and stratus are understudied.

Biomolecular Science and Engineering",Biomolecular Science and Engineering,Kenneth S. Kosik,"Understanding how genetic variation (genotype) contributes to diverse traits (phenotype) is a grand challenge in biology and the overarching theme of this dissertation. Neurological disorders include over 600 diseases and affect the central and peripheral nervous systems. Communication, intelligence, memory, and consciousness -- fundamental abilities that have elevated humankind above the rest of the animal kingdom, are all susceptible to attack from neurological disorders. The contribution of genetic variation to human traits and diseases has been studied for over a century, revealing a strong genetic component to almost every phenotype examined. Establishing genetic associations and delineating their molecular mechanisms in neurological disorders can reveal insight into the establishment, restoration, and enhancement of key human traits. The commencement of my doctoral studies coincided with the emergence of two groundbreaking scientific achievements: whole-genome sequencing and induced pluripotent stem cells. Here, I used these seminal technological advancements in biology as novel approaches to establish phenotype-genotype connections in neurological disorders. Functional genomics aims to integrate high throughput genomic and transcriptomic data to understand the biological function of genetic variation. This dissertation is split into two parts presenting divergent functional genomics approaches to understand two neurological disorders: whole-genome sequencing in Alzheimer's disease and induced pluripotent stem cell modeling of Williams syndrome. In the first part of this thesis, I used whole-genome sequencing data to identify genetic variants modifying age at onset of Alzheimer's disease in the world's largest family affected with this disease. This family, living in Antioquia, the mountainous region surrounding the major Colombian city Medellin, suffers from a rare form of Alzheimer's caused by a single mutation. This mutation, originating spontaneously in a single Spanish Conquistador, crossed the Atlantic and permeated throughout the pueblos indigenas living in Colombia. Over generations of geographic and genetic isolation coupled with exponential population growth, this single mutation spread to thousands of individuals, all who will develop a form of Alzheimer's at an average age of just 49 years. By sequencing the entire genomes of individuals affected with this disease at a range of different ages, we sought to identify genetic variants controlling the onset of this disease. First, we established a pipeline to sift through the wealth of information in a single genome. Next, we examined the genomic locus spanning the causal mutation to show definitively that the mutation originated in a Spanish settler in the early 16th century. Finally, we found a set of genetic variants in a cluster of chemokines that modifies the onset of Alzheimer's in this family and possibly in the general Alzheimer's population as well. In the second part of this thesis, I used induced pluripotent stem cells from individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) to identify disease-relevant pathways, a first step in connecting gene deletions to complex neurological traits. Arising from a hemizygous microdeletion of ~30 genes on chromosome 7, WS offers one of the best platforms to dissect the contributions of specific genes to neurocognitive phenotypes. Among various symptoms of the syndrome including specific craniofacial abnormalities and a characteristic heart valve defect, hyper-social behavior and enhanced language despite intellectual impairment are unique to WS. Converting induced pluripotent stem cells to neurons effectively allows us to study the brains of these individuals and identify which of the deleted genes may contribute to the neurological hallmarks. Integrating high-throughput transcriptional profiling with chromatin-immunoprecipitation of a gene deleted in WS, we identify a critical developmental node dysregulated in WS and the WS-deleted gene contributing to this defect.",Antioquia,-75.3412179,7.1986064,1

History of Art and Architecture",History of Art and Architecture,Mark A. Meadow,"In summary, my dissertation offers a new and coherent reading of a major, albeit previously understudied, body of works of a leading sixteenth-century artist, and explains them as intrinsic to the processes of demographic, confessional, and economic changes of the urban body. By focusing on the multitude of functions and applications of Bruegel's biblical images, I challenge the interpretations of mid-sixteenth-century Netherlandish art as increasingly secularized because of the contemporary Protestant suppression of religious images. Instead, I offer a positive narrative, one in which Bruegel's paintings testify to the success of the contemporary artistic quest for a novel idiom of non-devotional and non-confessional Christian art, and prove visual arts' ability to advance period socio-economic and religious discourses to the advantage of the entire community. Each chapter examines a different aspect of the engagement of Bruegel's paintings with Antwerp's contemporary transformation. Chapter One advocates for the understanding of the Tower of Babel, displayed in the suburban villa of an affluent entrepreneur Niclaes Jonghelinck, as a pictorial argument on the precedence of collective welfare over individual profit. By approaching the panel as an epitome of the role of visual arts in sparking convivial conversations, this chapter also introduces some of the main premises from which I proceed in my dissertation. The study of the unprecedented popularity of the images of the Conversion of Saint Paul, presented in Chapter Two, continues my interest in period discourses of entrepreneurship, but analyzes them as inseparable from confessional and legal circumstances. This chapter reveals that models of the community envisioned by Antwerp's citizens and their Spanish rulers were at odds, and draws from this observation two conclusions pertaining to the paintings of the Conversion. First, that their display served the purpose of the confessional self-fashioning of collectors, and second, that the contemporary elite began to actively question the uniform Catholic orthodoxy enforced by the Spanish Habsburgs as a necessary precondition for the commercial and cultural success of the community. Chapter Three takes the transformation of religiosity as its main subject, and introduces the Procession to Calvary and the Sermon of Saint John the Baptist as proxies of those changes. Demonstrating that Bruegel thematized in these two compositions religious and artistic shifts towards discursivity, I analyze convivium and open-air Protestant sermons as vehicles for the contemporaneous redefinition of religious ritual, removed from the official supervision of the Catholic Church, and relocated to the alternative space of private houses. This dissertation analyzes the emergence of a novel idiom of biblical imagery in the oeuvre of Pieter Bruegel the Elder in response to Antwerp's profound religious, demographic, and economic transformation. I distill the major innovative characteristics of Bruegel's religious paintings, such as his focus on the narrative, compositional complexity, and design for semi-public domestic spaces to show that in privileging those qualities, Bruegel introduced discursivity as the alternative to the devotional and liturgical functions of religious art. Correlating those changes in religious imagery during this period with Antwerp's transformation into an international commercial metropolis, I argue that Bruegel's biblical compositions became active instruments in negotiating the conditions of common welfare and consensual harmony. By analyzing the correspondence of the Antwerp elite, inventories, humanistic treatises, and extant pictorial examples of domestic decoration, I further make the case that the images' role in promoting social and economic cohesion was stimulated by their incorporation into the custom of learned dinner conversations (convivium).",Antwerp,4.4024643,51.2194475,2

History of Art and Architecture",History of Art and Architecture,Ann J. Adams,"Focusing on Clara Peeters's (born Antwerp, 1594--c. 1657) 1612 painting Still Life with Gold Goblets and Collectibles, this paper examines the complex visuality of the still life self-image in reference to its implications on and statement about early modern authorship. In the first half of the seventeenth century, still life artists often inserted a reflected self-image within the contours of glass orbs and shiny golden goblets. Taking the position that Peeters's use of a reflected self-image initiates a dialogue between an image of making and the surface on which it manifests itself, this study argues that such reflections articulate contemporary theory about the mutual and collaborative nature of authorship by implicating multiple parties in the authoring process. This thesis thus examines contemporary ideas about the relationship between art and craft and the generative role of nature and natural image-making processes, such as reflections. As such, the paper looks toward a history of images of reflection within Netherlandish art, the legacy of Renaissance ideas regarding the relationship of artisanship and nature, and seventeenth-century Dutch art literature. In building a case for a collaborative understanding of authorship, this paper additionally turns to both modern authorship theory as well as to seventeenth-century studio practice. In conclusion, this thesis argues that Peeters's still life self-images seeks to advertise to the contemporary collector not just her identity or status as author, but her very understanding of how her authorship came to be.",Antwerp,4.4024643,51.2194475,2

Comparative Literature",Comparative Literature,Dwight Reynolds,"This dissertation delineates the intersections of transgression, law, inclusion and exclusion, self and Other, in Farid al-Din &grave;Attar Nishapuri's (1145-1221) treatment of class, gender, sexuality, and religion. I examine four sets of love stories that &grave;Attar used in his writings to comment on issues of law, transgression, human diversity and inclusiveness. From literature to modern theory, this dissertation explores the reasons for &grave;Attar's inclusion of peripheral individuals in his works, and it integrates literary theory and a comparative medieval European perspective. Applying modern theoretical notions to medieval society, which produced its own perspectives on life, religion, society, and culture, might appear anachronistic; however, it is essential to inquire whether modern insights about these notions can help us better understand medieval works, or whether these ideas are exclusive to early modern and modern relations. Without such an analysis, we are left with an inadequate understanding of medieval culture and literature. Previous scholarship has investigated similar comparative notions in works such as Ibn al- &grave;Arabi's and Rumi's. However, research on &grave;Attar's works from a modern theoretical perspective in a comparative context has been limited. My study remedies this gap in the literature by examining the ways through which &grave;Attar engages with these modern notions. It shows that whereas members of minority populations are not fully integrated in modern Iranian society, inclusiveness was thinkable in the medieval period by extraordinary Sufi writers such as &grave;Attar. Throughout, I argue that &grave;Attar portrays his submission to the divine by accepting and embracing human diversity through Sufism and love of the divine. His works, Tadhkirat al-Awliya, Ilahi-nama, Musibat-nama and Mantiq al-Tayr, are precious for they show that inclusiveness was thinkable in the medieval period. This project illustrates that &grave;Attar's explorations of medieval inter-subjectivity are significant for our understanding of subjectivity in a modern world. It introduces new readings of &grave;Attar's works and encourages explorations of new possibilities, which can dismantle established narratives of our present experience and (mis)perceptions about human diversity and minorities.",Arabian Perninsula,47.4490397,19.4914108,13

Education",Education,John Yun,"The purpose of this study is to explore the self-efficacy of Saudi businesswomen and advocates at the Saudi Arabian regional Chambers of Commerce and Industry and to contribute to our understanding of how Saudi Arabian women leaders develop over time. Through Bandura's self-efficacy framework (2005) and its effect on two key generational cohorts of women advocates, much can be learned about those women leaders advocating for the rights of Saudi businesswomen. My focus on self-efficacy of these two Generational Cohorts came from a pilot study (Alfrayan, 2013) on the self-efficacy component of leadership among Saudi businesswomen in three main regions in Saudi Arabia, Riyadh, Jeddah, and the Eastern province. The pilot study yielded evidence of the existence of two distinct Generational Cohorts among the Participants. The two Generational Cohorts are characterized by the event of the establishment of a women section that provided services to businesswomen. It is important to note that different geographic regions established women sections at their local chamber of commerce on different dates. Thus, the generations are not defined by time, but by context. Focus is given to how these leaders describe the development of their self-efficacy and what they chose to do with it. For the purpose of this study, the Generational Cohorts of the Participants were added as a dimension to understand how self-efficacy compares between generations. Using a Quantitative case study approach to closely studying six cases of two generational cohorts in three geographical locations was preformed. Applying Bandura's (1995) self-efficacy framework as the lens for examining the leadership development of businesswomen and professionals in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in two generations by researching the following questions were answered: What do Saudi Arabian businesswomen and advocates identify as the most important factors furthering and hindering the development of their self-efficacy to advocate for a larger role for women in business? and In what ways do these women leaders describe the two Generational Cohorts of women advocate's effects on one another?",Arabian Perninsula,47.4490397,19.4914108,13

Film and Media Studies",Film and Media Studies,Peter Bloom,"This dissertation examines how imported TV series, including Spanish-language telenovelas and Turkish soap operas, have been culturally adapted by the second Moroccan channel, 2M, and the Middle East Broadcasting Center, MBC. The cultural adaptation of imported TV shows has relied on techniques of censorship in which sequences are re-edited and dubbed into Arabic dialects. This has marked a shift from earlier dubbing practices into traditional standard Arabic. The tightening of censorship restrictions has occurred because of the increasing accessibility of imported television shows given that they can now be more widely understood in local dialects. The alteration of essential dramatic events in these original television programs has, in several cases, distorted the narrative intent. An analysis of this type of censorship provides insights into how interrelated forms of political authoritarianism in the Arab world govern broadcast media. My dissertation also examines the social effects of Spanish-language telenovelas and Turkish soap operas on Arab viewers. The appearance of Spanish-language telenovelas on Moroccan television has heralded a more consumerist worldview particularly among young viewers aged 18-34. Many of these fans have expressed their admiration for depictions of luxury as represented by fashion, mansions, and expensive automobiles. The success of Turkish soap operas on MBC have found its most receptive audience among female viewers, who have started demanding a less authoritarian quality of interaction from their spouses. Depictions of the caring way Turkish male protagonists interact with female characters, who are presumably Muslim as well, has been a significant context for social change. Also, young female fans have used social media platforms, such as Facebook, to voice their moral and sexual preferences in men, taking Turkish fictional characters as their model. Arab female fans in the online fan communities increasingly discuss cultural taboos pertaining to male sexual appeal and their own physical and sexual preferences in men, expressing their aspirations for change in gender stereotypes and sexuality.",Arabian Perninsula,47.4490397,19.4914108,13

Geography, Joint Program SDSU","Geography, Joint Program SDSU",Fernando J. Bosco,"The findings illuminate how compound residents perceive their environments at various scales, underscore the variegated impacts of compound living on place attachment, sense of community, and social networks, and highlight how mobility (within and beyond Bahrain) influences these social dimensions of compound living. Finally, challenging notions that residential segregation necessarily limits social interactions, I contend that segregation is not as absolute as it may initially seem; the formation of social ties across compound walls illustrates how the built environment influences the social environments of compound residents, but does not determine them. As residential segregation engenders complex and multifaceted social effects, the findings bring into relief the ways in which various social, cultural, and demographic factors interact with the built environment to shape residents' experiences. This dissertation foregrounds social processes in concert with urban phenomena and contributes to understandings of urban and social dynamics in the Gulf city at a time when the Gulf states have become important global focal points for processes of urbanization and labor migration. Rapid and radical socioeconomic transformations have accompanied the development of the hydrocarbon-exporting economies of the Arab Gulf states. The six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states are some of the largest recipients of labor migrants in the world, and the region has the second highest rate of urbanization in the world. Given these changes, it is critical to understand the urban impacts of migration flows that have dramatically increased the proportion of foreigners in the cities of the Gulf. This dissertation examines the urban and social geographies associated with gated housing compounds (developments geared toward white collar expatriate workers) in Bahrain. I investigate how associated productions of urban space and social processes of community formation of compound residents relate to and influence one another. My analysis is based on interviews with expatriates living in compounds and other residential accommodations. I also interviewed academics, planners, and landlords, and conducted surveys, participant observation, archival research, and field surveys.

Global and International Studies",Global and International Studies,Richard Appelbaum,"As billions of dollars are being invested in construction, construction workers are the physical driving force behind the UAE's infrastructural development and overall growth. Despite being an integral component to decreasing the dependence on oil rents and diversifying the economy through construction, workers in this industry are severely mistreated. This study seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of workers' rights in the construction industry in the UAE. The central research question framing this study is: what are the labor violations faced by workers and to what degree has the UAE government responded to these issues? The follow up questions are then, have working conditions improved and what are the challenges in improving these conditions? This study employs a qualitative approach, drawing on current literature in order to answer the central research questions. The discussion in this paper is based on an analysis of the information collected through archival research and is divided into 7 chapters. The penultimate chapter of this thesis features a case study of Abu Dhabi's $27 billion megaproject, Saayidat Island, which is home to the new Guggenheim, Louvre, and New York University (NYU) satellite campus. This current case study will be used in order to examine the status of workers' rights violations and the level of enforcement of government policy on labor issues. After a review of government policy on labor, this paper concludes that the UAE does not lack legislation on labor issues, but rather lacks enforcement of these laws. Thus, this study finds that the largest hurdles to enforcing labor laws is the level of crony capitalism between the government and the construction industry and the disposability of labor. This study hypothesizes that the partnerships Abu Dhabi is building with big international names at Saayidat Island, like the Guggenheim and Louvre museums and also universities like New York University, may serve as a tipping point and bring more international scrutiny to violations of workers' rights in this industry. The hope is that mounting international pressure, as seen in Qatar leading up to the 2022 World Cup, will encourage the UAE to go beyond responding to these issues at the institutional level and motivate them to enforce the labor laws on the ground. In the 1960s the United Arab Emirates (UAE) struck oil. Over the years, the UAE has increasingly invested in an array of sectors to reduce economic dependence on hydrocarbon exports. All sectors that the UAE is actively investing in, are not only global but require infrastructure development. Between the Emirates of Dubai and Abu Dhabi there are currently about 1,300 construction projects in development worth over $418 billion (Sonmez et al., 2011). The Emirates lack the domestic labor force required to support these construction endeavors. For this reason, the UAE is largely dependent on migrant labor.",Arabian Perninsula,47.4490397,19.4914108,13

I challenge the dominant narrative that the international community has failed to intervene in Syria, by pointing to the manifold government-funded arms transfers to opposition groups beginning in 2012. I find that there are two significant networks of arms trafficking: one through Jordan with Saudi Arabian and American support; the other through Turkey with Qatari support. These patterns and rivalries between donor countries have contributed to three processes within the transformation from revolution to civil war: militarization, increased sectarianism, and fragmentation of the opposition. I review two mechanisms of international arms control: multilateral embargoes and the recent Arms Trade Treaty. Their weaknesses, as evident in the case of Syria, are related to the problems of self-monitoring and enforcement by states that have contradictory incentives. Next, I address the related issue of surplus arms by looking at how the failure of disarmament measures in Iraq and Libya had a direct impact on arms proliferation in Syria. I conclude with a discussion of the legality of arms transfers to non-state actors and the need to focus on political rather than military solutions to globalized conflict.",Arabian Perninsula,47.4490397,19.4914108,13

Global and International Studies",Global and International Studies,Paul Amar,"The pivotal role Islamism will play in the post-Arab Spring global dynamic drives this thesis. It analyses the various origins and ideologies of the most seminal Islamist movement, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. As Egypt serves as the socio-political fulcrum of the Middle East North Africa region, so too stands the Muslim Brotherhood as the logical genesis for a discussion about the larger phenomenon of Islamism. My thesis argues that the Brotherhood specifically, and Islamism generally, offers far more flexibility in ideology than the West frequently concedes. Its development proves non-linear, complex and frequently interrupted by bifurcation; the ideologies it produced and still produces are therefore polymorphic, ranging from moderate and conciliatory to belligerent and radical. Which, if any, Islamism prevails in the Middle East will depend on the abilities of the various movements' leaders to offer beneficial alternatives to the decades of tyranny the masses rejected in the Arab Spring. I argue that by returning to the ideology of the Brotherhood's founding father, Hassan al-Banna, a moderate, conciliatory, and above all flexible interpretation of Islamism may be found. This requires a reconsideration of the radicalism that has spiraled out of the ranks of the Brotherhood, specifically acknowledging Sayyid Qutb's writings as aberrations of al Banna's message, rather than as natural evolutions. I conclude that Islamism and radical Islamism must be separated in academic and political discourse, treated as related but separate phenomena, in order to push the quotidial dialogue in a mutually generative direction. To do this, I first trace the historical trajectory of the Brotherhood, highlighting incidences of flexibility and cooperative methods of the movement to insure its survival through the tumultuous post-Colonial era. The second section highlights the Brotherhood's oscillations between radical and moderate ideological positions. My analysis demonstrates that the Muslim Brotherhood has a long history of pragmatic response to changing political situations. The West too often views the Muslim Brotherhood through the ""Clash of Civilization"" narrative -- in which the Muslim Brotherhood is one continuous, fixed entity in opposition to the West -- rather than acknowledging the bifurcated and malleable identity of the organization.",Arabian Perninsula,47.4490397,19.4914108,13

History",History,R. Stephen Humphreys,"Outside of Iran, Muslims denigrated Zoroastrians through unflattering comparisons. They likened Zoroastrians to Vikings, Qadarites, and other groups perceived as unfamiliar, pagan, or heretical. Such comparisons, made by Muslims who had little experience with actual Zoroastrians, were highly rhetorical and intended for internal consumption. Like tales of fire temple desecration, they ultimately facilitated the construction of the Muslims' own communal identity. Therefore, not even the harsh Islamic discourse validates the lachrymose narrative of Zoroastrian history. Rather, the existence of competing Muslim discourses about Zoroastrians reveals the contested, contingent, and contextual nature of Muslim-Zoroastrian relations in early Islamic history. This dissertation treats Muslim-Zoroastrian relations between the seventh and eleventh centuries. It challenges the lachrymose narrative of Zoroastrian history, which overemphasizes the role of religious violence in precipitating the decline of Zoroastrianism after the Islamic conquest of Iran. This gloomy narrative is a product of Orientalist tropes, polemical historiographies about the treatment of dhimmis and the effect of the Islamic conquest, the apocalyptic tenor of medieval Zoroastrian sources, and concerns about the status of Zoroastrians in modern Iran and India. Scholars of Zoroastrianism and Iranian languages have written most of the secondary literature on this topic, despite the fact that most of the primary sources were written by Muslims in Arabic. Since few Islamicists have studied Muslim-Zoroastrian relations, the lachrymose narrative persists. However, there was a harsh Islamic discourse about Zoroastrians. Local histories of Iranian cities are replete with tales of fire temple desecration. Medieval Muslim historians in South Asia often invented tales of Hindu temple desecration as part of a triumphal narrative of religious supersession. Iranian historians did likewise. Although there are a few credible accounts of temple desecration, the secondary literature too often fails to properly contextualize them. These attacks, when considered in context, do not seem to have been motivated primarily by religious animus. The scale and religious significance of fire temple desecration has been exaggerated. There are two competing discourses about Zoroastrians in the early Islamic sources---one accommodating, the other harsh. The accommodating discourse, embedded in reports about the conduct of the Prophet Muhammad, urged Muslims to tax Zoroastrians and, later, to treat them like People of the Book. Abbasid scribes attempted to relieve Zoroastrians of particular legal disabilities by forging the 'ahd-nama, a charter of religious freedom that the Prophet Muhammad supposedly issued to the descendants of Salman al-Farisi. This charter, which belongs to several genres of Islamic literature, probably had a Muslim author. It indicates that there were hybrid religious sympathies in early Islamic Iran, which challenges the lachrymose narrative of Zoroastrian history.",Arabian Perninsula,47.4490397,19.4914108,13

The city was transformed in the fourth century into the Christian ""Holy Land,"" and this dissertation examines how the imperially-driven change either adapted or overcame the city's previous associations with Judaism and paganism. I approached the topic as one of the creation of ""places of memory,"" following several sociological theorists of memory (e.g. M. Halbwachs, P. Nora). The chapters include analysis of early boundary-creation between Christians and Jews and the memorializing and identity-affirming aspects of the literary genre of ecclesiastical history, which grew up in parallel with the creation of the ""Holy Land."" The chief source for this section is Eusebius, who was both historian and witness to the process in the fourth century. I assess whether sacred space could be turned on its head---was Jerusalem a blessed city, or a cursed one? Pilgrim literature helps to inform this section on attraction, avoidance, and shifting blame. That leads to analysis of the fifth-century ecclesiastical historians (who saw themselves as Eusebius' heirs, but grew up in a totally different world) and transfers of holiness: relics, especially from Jerusalem, spreading throughout the world. Finally, running throughout the work is the thread of marginalization of Jews and Jewish places of memory in the increasingly Christianized cultic topography of Jerusalem. The final chapter takes us through the seventh-century Arab conquest of Jerusalem, and analyzes the new complexities and competition for sacred real estate amongst all three faiths that now held the city to be holy.

The results of this analysis are compared to mainstream descriptions of Swahili architecture. They are then used to make comparisons between the remains of pre-colonial Swahili stone structures and those in built environments that are popularly identified as essentially 'Islamic.' This project seeks to generate an updated description of early Swahili architecture while providing a useful case study of Islamic architecture at the margins of the field. The data for this work was attained through a combination of archival and onsite research. The latter was carried out through visits to Kenya and Tanzania over the course of two summers, 2006 and 2009. The analysis is separated into sections focusing on religious, domestic and public spaces that were chosen from a cross section of stone town sites. The findings support that pre-colonial Swahili spaces were designed by and for the local Swahili community. The analysis of religious structures suggests that nine-bay mosques may have had a commemorative function. For larger mosques it is proposed that longitudinal orientation and the visual obstruction of the mihrab by central pillars are deliberate (rather than accidental) features that were intended to emphasize the direction of prayer. The analysis of housing reveals that pre-colonial Swahili stone houses exhibit only minimal degrees of visual restriction: the stringently gendered, intimacy gradient that is thought to circumscribe both social and physical Swahili space was a relatively late development that can be linked to the period of Omani colonization in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The late colonial period also marks the earliest evidence of a formal relationship between Swahili stone houses and coastal South Arabian houses. The analysis of public space suggests that pre-sixteenth century parallels between Mijikenda and Swahili urban form are tenuous at best. When these parallels exist they can be ascribed to a shared cultural climate without the necessity of identifying direct links between one or another local groups.",Arabian Perninsula,47.4490397,19.4914108,13

However, little work has been done to place these student movements into a broader historical context. Historically, Chilean students have had a long record of both general political activism and specific activism over educational matters dating back over 100 years. Even the most recent student protests, which developed into a broader movement against the neoliberal policies implemented under the dictator General Augusto Pinochet, were preceded by demonstrations with similar demands dating back to at least 2000. However, these precedents do not explain why the movements developed between 2000 and 2011, rather than immediately after the fall of the dictatorship in 1990. I argue that part of the reason is because that the students in the twenty-first century were the first ones to attend high school and college who were not raised under the dictatorship and for that reason they did not fear the repression and violence their predecessors, who grew up predominantly under the dictatorship, experienced. Thus, an analysis of the history of student political activism in Chile, the history of Chilean politics, the history of the Chilean education system, and the neoliberal reforms, especially in education, is necessary to provide a historical, political, and social context for the recent student movements.",Arabian Perninsula,47.4490397,19.4914108,13

Music",Music,Scott L. Marcus,"Throughout this work, violinists' negotiations of in-between spaces reveal the diverse set of ideas that their instrument can embody, encompassing progress, potentiality, sophistication, and nostalgia. Violinists play, teach, and discuss the violin and other violinists in particular ways to express their multifaceted senses of self. By bringing these individual and interrelated stories to light, I contribute a unique perspective and analysis to our understandings of the continued impact of historic musical exchanges and the rich potential created by positions of in-betweenness. Over the past 150 years, the European violin has grown from a new import to a fundamental fixture in the Arab music of Egypt. Due to the violin's history, physical attributes, and symbolic importance, violinists regularly work between categories often set in opposition, especially Western classical and Arab musics. In this dissertation, I argue that it is this very in-betweenness that makes the violin a powerful tool for Egyptian violinists and composers. Through a series of biographies organized historically, I show how violinists have infused the instrument with different clusters of meaning, performing complex senses of identity and complicating musical categories in the process. I begin with the history of the violin's entrance into Egypt, spanning the late-nineteenth and early-twentieth centuries, when violinist Sami al-Shawwa and others used the instrument to negotiate the space between colonizer and colonized, and Europe and Egypt. My next chapter, centered on the so-called Golden Era of Egyptian film and song (1930s-1950s), examines narratives and media examples placing violinists Ah&dotbelow;mad al-H&dotbelow;ifnawi and Anwar Mansi at opposite ends of a tradition-modernity spectrum. I then investigate how Sa'd Muh&dotbelow;ammad H&dotbelow;asan and other teachers negotiate contemporary tensions resulting from the intersection of Arab music aesthetics and Western pedagogical legacies in the Higher Institute for Arab Music's violin program. Subsequently, I address violinists who seek performance and teaching opportunities outside of state-sponsored institutions and the transnational Arab popular music market, such as 'Abduh Daghir. Lastly, I consider violinists' changing role in that market in conversation with the strong sense of nostalgia present for earlier players, as violinists refer to their predecessors to situate themselves vis-a-vis contemporary identity debates.",Arabian Perninsula,47.4490397,19.4914108,13

Music",Music,Paul Berkowitz,"A stylistic incongruity exists between Claude Debussy's songs and piano music in the first half of his life. Out of the eighty-five songs he composed, roughly three-quarters appear in his early period (1880-1893). Conversely, his solo piano works were almost non-existent before 1888 and did not reach maturity until 1901. This document studies representative works from his early, transitional, and mature periods to show a correlation between his songs and piano music at an approximate eight-year interval over several years. This allows us to trace his stylistic evolution and provide explanations for the delayed maturity of his solo piano music relative to other genres. Because Debussy's songs developed sooner than his solo piano music, we are provided a useful measuring stick for purposes of comparison, analysis, and development. Chapter two presents analyses of several of Debussy's earlier songs (Nuit d'etoiles, Beau soir, and Fete galante) and piano compositions (Premiere Arabesque and Suite bergamasque), establishing similarities across the temporal gap. Chapter three continues into his transitional period, specifically examining songs from the Ariettes oubliees (and Apparition) and the Images ( oubliees) for piano. I examine his mature works in chapter four. There, I demonstrate that the Proses lyriques song cycle and the Pour le piano for solo piano are not only stylistically related, but represent a culmination of their respective predecessors, sometimes borrowing directly from earlier works. Two trends emerge when surveying Debussy's songs and solo piano works: the incorporation of external features into compositions early in his career and the adoption of new compositional techniques later in life. The songs are representative of the former situation. Symbolist literature and baroque-influenced keyboard writing form the basis of Debussy's early output. The latter tendency to embrace other compositional styles, such as Wagnerian and Javanese gamelan, manifests itself in the piano works. However, trends in Debussy's song output directly influence his later solo piano works. The gradual inclusion of his songs' expressive imagery into solo piano works highlights Debussy's growing affinity with the instrument and provides a working timeline of the composer's stylistic growth.",Arabian Perninsula,47.4490397,19.4914108,13

Earth Science",Earth Science,Andre R. Wyss,"The five new taxa described in this study are included in rigorous phylogenetic analyses of Interatheriinae and Hegetotheriidae (Typotheria, Notoungulata), providing new hypotheses of morphological evolution within these clades, and documenting independent yet apparently simultaneous radiations of interatheres and hegetotheres with ever-growing (hypselodont) dentitions. A significant majority of fossils from LdL are small-bodied taxa (e.g., rodents and typotherian notoungualtes) represented by dental and cranial elements. This size distribution is unusual compared to other well-known early Miocene faunas, and may reflect differential transport of skeletal elements in lahar-associated depositional settings. The high level of endemism across multiple SALMAs at LdL is also striking, particularly considering the geographic proximity of faunas from LdL with roughly coeval counterparts in neighboring regions of Argentina. The unique history of mammals in South America has long provided significant evolutionary and geological insights, but the continent's fossil record is strongly biased toward the lowlands of Argentine Patagonia. Recent collecting efforts in the Andean Main Range of Chile, near Laguna del Laja (LdL) (_37.5 S, 71 W), have yielded a stratigraphically superposed series of early to late Miocene fossil mammal assemblages, shedding light on the poorly known extra-Patagonian history of South American Neogene mammals. Several hundred specimens have been recovered from the Cura-Mallin and overlying Trapa-Trapa formations at LdL. Nearly all of these fossils were collected from a well-described stratigraphic sequence that includes 17 high precision 40Ar/39Ar ages. This robust temporal framework encompasses fossiliferous horizons spanning _20-9 Ma. This provinciality of the Andean faunas, relative to Argentine assemblages, likely reflects sampling of a regionally distinct and isolated paleoenvironment. Herein I provide a detailed account of the ungulates from the Cura-Mallin Formation at LdL; these range in age from _20-15 Ma (early to middle Miocene).

Earth Science",Earth Science,Andre R. Wyss,"The five new taxa described in this study are included in rigorous phylogenetic analyses of Interatheriinae and Hegetotheriidae (Typotheria, Notoungulata), providing new hypotheses of morphological evolution within these clades, and documenting independent yet apparently simultaneous radiations of interatheres and hegetotheres with ever-growing (hypselodont) dentitions. A significant majority of fossils from LdL are small-bodied taxa (e.g., rodents and typotherian notoungualtes) represented by dental and cranial elements. This size distribution is unusual compared to other well-known early Miocene faunas, and may reflect differential transport of skeletal elements in lahar-associated depositional settings. The high level of endemism across multiple SALMAs at LdL is also striking, particularly considering the geographic proximity of faunas from LdL with roughly coeval counterparts in neighboring regions of Argentina. The unique history of mammals in South America has long provided significant evolutionary and geological insights, but the continent's fossil record is strongly biased toward the lowlands of Argentine Patagonia. Recent collecting efforts in the Andean Main Range of Chile, near Laguna del Laja (LdL) (_37.5 S, 71 W), have yielded a stratigraphically superposed series of early to late Miocene fossil mammal assemblages, shedding light on the poorly known extra-Patagonian history of South American Neogene mammals. Several hundred specimens have been recovered from the Cura-Mallin and overlying Trapa-Trapa formations at LdL. Nearly all of these fossils were collected from a well-described stratigraphic sequence that includes 17 high precision 40Ar/39Ar ages. This robust temporal framework encompasses fossiliferous horizons spanning _20-9 Ma. This provinciality of the Andean faunas, relative to Argentine assemblages, likely reflects sampling of a regionally distinct and isolated paleoenvironment. Herein I provide a detailed account of the ungulates from the Cura-Mallin Formation at LdL; these range in age from _20-15 Ma (early to middle Miocene).

I argue that these documentaries provide a new vantage point from which to consider how spaces in the postdictatorial landscape are mediated, shaped, and reshaped in memory over time, remolded to the demands of each successive generation. I begin by considering the politics of these recent documentaries in relation with the more militant films of the New Latin American Cinema of the '60s and '70s. This chapter also includes consideration of the different relationships to memory of those who experienced the dictatorship as adults, and the postmemory generation, or those who were children during, or were born after the dictatorship. In the two chapters that follow, I consider films that employ sites with memorial significance: first, official memorial sites, with wide recognition and significance, and second, sites that resonate within individual or smaller-scale memories, whether that of the filmmaker or their subjects. I read these sites through the films and through my own site visits in order to elucidate the ways in which the films alter the experience of the sites, or function as memorials in their own right. Finally, I examine the networks of distribution and sites of exhibition for these films, including museums that exhibit documentary clips, screenings at memory sites and at schools, and documentary representations of the space of exhibition in a memorial context.",Argentina,-63.616672,-38.416097,11

Unfortunately, popular views of tango in the United States often limit the art form to vignettes from Dancing with the Stars or the music of Astor Piazzolla. With this document, I seek to introduce North American scholars and musicians to the new, vibrant tango music being created today in Argentina or what tangueros are calling the ""Music of Buenos Aires."". This document is based on my first-hand experience in Argentina during the South American winters of 2007, 2008, 2011, and 2012 with Argentine tangueros and this music. I focus on three tangueros who are currently composing and performing in Buenos Aires today, namely violinist Damian Bolotin (b. 1965), pianist Sonia Possetti (b. 1973), and bassist Juan Pablo Navarro (b. 1971). I provide brief biographical sketches of each tanguero and supply insights into his/her performance style. Additionally, I offer an interpretative guide to the performance practices of this music by placing it in a cultural and historical context.

I argue that the representation of the crisis of the family in certain postmodern Latin American films is a symbol of the effects of the violent transition to a globalized world put into practice by authoritarian regimes and dirty wars. The motif of incest -and in lesser extent, of parricide- is a polysemic narrative device that operates as a sign for the impossibility of representation of the historic events of the recent past, the effects of which emerge as a phantasmagoric (post)memory and discontent in the Latin American society of the present. The cinematic works I discuss include eleven recent films from Argentina, Chile, Peru, Brazil, and Mexico: the Peruvian films Ojos que no ven (2003) by Francisco Lombardi, Jose Mendez's Dias de Santiago (2004), and Claudia Llosa's Madeinusa (2006); Sebastian Lelio's La sagrada familia (2004), Pablo Larrain's Fuga (2006), and Tony Manero (2008) from Chile; the Argentinean Geminis (2005) by Albertina Carri, and Lucia Puenzo's El nino pez (2009); Matheus Nachtergaele's A festa da menina morta (2008) from Brazil; Ricardo Montreuil's La mujer de mi hermano (2005), a Mexican, Peruvian, and Chilean co-production; and Carlos Reygadas's Batalla en el cielo (2005) from Mexico. Based on this cinematic selection, I propose that the representation of the crisis of the family, which emphasizes the transgression of the incest taboo, and parricide as motifs or recurrent themes, is an allegory of the culmination of a crisis, and at the same time, operates as an allegory of a symptom and critical device of the homogenized values of the patriarchal order that has lost its legitimacy. The criticism of these values focuses on the different modes of articulation of the roles in the family in terms of class, ethnicity, gender and sexuality, which questions at the same time the foundation of modernity as a homogeneous system that the postmodern narrative defies and fragments. The transgression of the incest taboo as a fundamentally masculine act, is at the same time an excess of power, and indicates that what is at question here is the patriarchal discourse as a valid and endurable one in a more heterogeneous and multifaceted emerging postmodern society at the threshold of the new century.",Argentina,-63.616672,-38.416097,11

Spanish and Portuguese",Spanish and Portuguese,Ellen McCracken,"To date, no lengthy study has examined queer sexualities and space in Latin American film. In three chapters organized around different spatial scales, I theorize how spatiality reflects and affects the development and expression of queer sexuality in eight films from throughout Latin America. In the first chapter, I explore public and private spaces in relation to queer sexuality in Francisco J. Lombardi's No se lo digas a nadie (Peru 1998), Tomas Gutierrez Alea and Juan Carlos Tabio's Fresa y chocolate (Cuba 1993), and Jorge Fons's El callejon de los milagros (Mexico 1994). I argue that despite their attempts to carve out private spaces---with varying degrees of success---the queer characters in these films are not able to escape the influence of the public sphere and heteronormativity. In Chapter Two, I examine the relationship between queer sexualities and city space. I argue that in Enrique Bochichio's El cuarto de Leo (Uruguay 2009) Montevideo is presented as a sort of utopia, a liberating space for individuals who may choose to come out of the closet. By conflating homosexuality with criminality, Marcelo Pineyro's Plata quemada (Argentina 2000), on the other hand, depicts the traditionally oppressive, unsustainable relationship between the city and homosexuals. In Chapter Three, I explore the use of the body as a space for working through issues of queer sexuality. In the films that I analyze, there is an increasing degree of materialization of the body as space. In Javier Fuentes-Leon's Contracorriente (Peru 2009), the ghost of the protagonist's dead lover serves as a sort of mirror that helps the protagonist cope with his sexuality. In Karim Ainouz's Madame Sata (Brazil 2002), issues of sexual identity, gender, race, and class are consolidated in the body of a cross-dressing performer. In Lucia Puenzo's XXY (Argentina 2007), the concern for the body as space is materialized to the greatest extent. The protagonist is an intersexed adolescent whose body serves as a space that represents not only her internal struggles, but also those of her parents and the society within which she does not neatly fit.",Argentina,-63.616672,-38.416097,11

Anthropology",Anthropology,Michael Glassow,"To reconstruct ceramic production and consumption pattern, laser-ablation inductively couple plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) was conducted on 1,069 sherds from the Mt. Trumbull/Tuweep and the lowland Virgin areas, along with source clay samples collected from the same areas. To examine how the use of clay resources changed over time, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating was conducted on 113 sherd samples with compositional information. Ultimately, the goal of this study is to understand why ceramic production and circulation patterns changed during the Ancestral Pueblo occupation of this peripheral area of the American Southwest. I hypothesize that ceramic production and regional interaction patterns were shaped in part by the need to minimize subsistence risk in this marginal agricultural environment. The data presented here suggest that different environmental conditions favored different social interaction and local ceramic production patterns. In Mt. Trumbull, under unstable climatic conditions and low population density, near the beginning of the Puebloan occupation, pots moved along with human migration. Later, when populations were higher and environmental conditions were equally unstable, pots were moved through interregional trade. In addition, clay resource specialization was favored early but was replaced later by exclusive use of optimal clays when population numbers were higher. In the lowland Virgin area, exchange played an important role as a risk minimization strategy throughout the Puebloan occupation, but clay-resource specialization gained importance later on, when populations increased. The Arizona Strip and adjacent areas in Utah and Nevada are in a very marginal environment. This dissertation investigates how small-scale farmers who survived more than 1000 years in this area coped with the challenges of this marginal environment by examining how and why social interaction patterns varied over time in different parts of the region. Artifact assemblages from this area that date between A.D. 200 and 1350 are characterized by widely distributed ceramics tempered with olivine, a volcanic mineral. Sources of olivine lie in the vicinity of Mt. Trumbull and Tuweep, near the northwestern part of the Grand Canyon. The olivine-tempered ceramics were distributed mostly westward from Mt. Trumbull, up to 100 km to the lowland Virgin area in southern Nevada.",Arizona,-111.0937311,34.0489281,3

This study follows the everyday interactions of a peer group of second generation Turkish and Meskhetian Turkish immigrant children in two Arizona settings; an elementary school, and a Turkish Saturday (heritage language) School, to examine how the children negotiate ideologies and identities in interaction with peers. ""The role of children in socializing children is particularly critical for understanding how identities are negotiated in the increasingly multicultural and multilingual post-colonial and transnational societies where children grow up today"" (Goodwin and Kyratzis, 2007, p. 281). The study combines methods of ethnography with talk-in-interaction. Children were followed in naturally occurring peer interactions over one year, and were interviewed in groups about using Turkish and English. The elementary school and Turkish Saturday School adhered to an English-only ideology and Turkish-only ideology, respectively. The Turkish-English bilingual/multilingual children of this study used mostly English in their peer group interactions at both sites. The children created domain-associations (Fader, 2001; Garrett, 2005; Paugh, 2005; Schieffelin, 2003) for Turkish and English through their language practices (e.g., Turkish for adult voicing and religious messages; English for peer talk). They also code-switched between Turkish and English to accomplish a variety of conversational purposes, including shifting to a new ""frame"" (Auer, 1998; Ervin-Tripp & Reyes, 2005; Goffman, 1974, 1981; Gumperz & Cook-Gumperz, 2005; Kyratzis, Tang & Koymen, 2009; Zentella, 1997) or kind of talk other than the on-going school task, where could ask questions of and help one another or make commentary.

This investigation represents an in-depth study of a space whose history has been recorded only briefly at best and analyzed not at all. From videotaped interviews and events collected over the span of twelve years, news articles, various primary documents and still photographs, and communication with individuals related by family history to Winslow, this study chronicles a civic move to effect a local ""renaissance"" by restoring commercial and civic enterprise at the center of Winslow's once-vital ""main street."" It traces efforts to save Winslow's historic Harvey House, La Posada, from demolition and support its restoration, establish a park and a music festival to attract visitors by memorializing a particularly iconic song, the Eagles' ""Take it Easy,"" and, in conjunction with a national preservation movement begun in the 1990s, revivify interest in Winslow as a stop along the ""Mother Road"" (Route 66). Different groups of citizens faced unique challenges under twenty-first century conditions of economy, location, and social expectation as they set out to return a moribund commercial district to its historical function as remembered by native residents and anticipated by unfamiliar travelers. Set against the nineteenth and early twentieth century background of Winslow's birth and development years the analysis considers the meaning of ""renaissance"" desires at the turn of the twenty-first, based as they were on material ideals of economic revival in a place and at a time when central cities nationwide were experiencing decline. The project combines seven chapters of written history with five short visual documentaries, each of which illustrates the nature of the place and cultural qualities of its residents as they participated in the alteration of their local image. While the historic hotel that people hoped would serve as a catalyst to downtown revitalization was restored beyond almost everyone's expectations, neither commerce nor the architectural landscape that had once accommodated it was revived in Winslow's downtown. The success gap resulted from differences in market appeal: La Posada had a market; downtown Winslow did not. Still, the town's renaissance dreams were not completely dashed.",Arizona,-111.0937311,34.0489281,3

History",History,Elizabeth DePalma Digeser,"In their respective heydays, Athens, Rome, and Chang'an functioned as centers of government, economic powerhouses, global schools, sites of religious pilgrimage, and tourist attractions. Many of the diverse immigrants they attracted settled in the neighborhoods at the center of this analysis: Athens' port of Piraeus, Rome's Trans Tiberim district, and Northwest Chang'an. These communities stood out as ""small worlds"" within their cities at large, where ethnic, linguistic, and cultural differences overlapped with physical boundaries such as rivers, roads, and walls. Residents carved out places for themselves in their new homes by learning how to skillfully navigate these boundaries. Whether by traversing the urban landscape during their daily commute, participating in civic or religious ceremonies, or attending festivals and entertainments, newcomers came into contact with locals on a daily basis. These interactions blurred lines between ""us"" and ""them"" in ways that called into question the limits of national identity and, depending on the circumstances, could either fan the flames of xenophobia or nurture new cultural syntheses. In this sense, life at the center of the Athenian, Roman, and Tang empires resembled that on their outer frontiers, where ""civilized"" insiders and ""barbarian"" outsiders lived poised between intimate coexistence and violent rejection. Assessing these imperial capitals as urban borderlands allows us see that this tension was not an aberration or strictly a regional phenomenon. It was quite literally built into the heart of all three empires. How does gaining an empire change the conqueror? Why is the assimilation of new populations, goods, and ideas sometimes seen as a marker of a people's greatness, and at other times as a dangerous threat from within? This project analyzes immigration to three capital cities: Athens (5th-4 th centuries BCE), Rome (1st-4th centuries CE), and Chang'an, capital of Tang dynasty China (7th-10 th centuries CE). It analyzes ancient textual and archaeological evidence through the lens of borderland theory to argue that the boundaries surrounding immigrant neighborhoods transformed each of these iconic cities into urban borderlands where ideas of social otherness had physical analogues. It was in these urban borderlands that the problem of how to accommodate new populations into existing structures of imperial domination was worked out.",Athens,23.7275388,37.9838096,2

Theater Studies",Theater Studies,Simon Williams,"This dissertation interrogates the role of adaptation in creating and maintaining hegemonic cultural formations through a study of two tragedies by Euripides as they were adapted by neoclassical playwrights during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in France and England. Adaptation studies, a relatively new field of academic inquiry, has thus far largely focused on defining adaptation in relation to more established studies of translation and intertextuality, and has primarily concentrated on cross-medium adaptations such as novels adapted into film. Taking these focuses as a point of departure, this study expands the field of adaptation studies by looking at adaptation not across medium, but across time and culture, through the examination of stage plays that were rewritten for public performance in early modern Western Europe hundreds of years after their initial performances in ancient Greece. In this context, with no change in medium, the uses of adaptation as a tool for disguising cultural difference are revealed, refocusing the scholarly discussion of adaptation from a search for definitions to an exploration of its implications for cultural studies. Exploring the ways in which new ideas about religion, gender, and morality made unadapted Greek tragedies unsuitable for public presentation on early modern stages, the case studies examine the alterations made in nine different adaptations of the two Iphigenia plays that have come down to us from ancient Athens. Looking at adaptations of adaptations (Gluck's operatic adaptation of Racine's retelling of Iphigenia in Aulis, for example) alongside direct adaptations of Greek tragedies, this study argues that local cultural conventions may be threatened by even very recent versions of a story, and that adaptation is leveraged accordingly in order to neutralize such ideological threats. In the process, this exploration traces the ways in which neoclassicism was interpreted and reinterpreted as it shifted times, locations, and genres: from the seventeenth century to the eighteenth, France to England, and spoken tragedy to opera.",Athens,23.7275388,37.9838096,2

How Middle School Students Make Decisions About Socioscientific Issues,2013,"Emery, Katherine Beth","University of California, Santa Barbara. Marine Science",Marine Science,"Steven D. Gaines, Allison Whitmer","People worldwide are faced with making decisions daily. While many decisions are quick (e.g., what clothes to wear), others, such as those about environmental issues (e.g., overfishing), require more thought and have less immediate outcomes. How one makes such decisions depends on how one interprets, evaluates, and uses evidence. The central objective of this thesis was to investigate environmental science literacy in general, and specifically, to understand how evidence and other factors impact decision-making. I conducted three main studies: First, I provide an example of how decision-making practices affect environmental systems and services through a descriptive case study of Atlantic bluefin tuna overfishing. I reviewed the scientific, historical and cultural factors contributing to a paradox of marine preservation in the Mediterranean and highlighted the need for education and informed decision-making about such social and ecological issues. This study motivated me to investigate how people make decisions about environmental issues. Second, I interviewed middle school students to understand how they describe and evaluate evidence hypothetically and in practice about environmental issues---a key component of environmental literacy. Students discussed how they would evaluate evidence and then were then given a packet containing multiple excerpts of information from conflicting stakeholders about an environmental issue and asked how they would make voting or purchasing decisions about these issues. Findings showed that students' ideas about evaluating evidence (e.g., by scientific and non-scientific criteria) match their practices in part. This study was unique in that it investigated how students evaluate evidence that (1) contradicts other evidence and (2), conflicts with the student's prior positions. Finally, I investigated whether middle school students used evidence when making decisions about socioscientific issues. I hypothesized that holding a strong opinion would decrease the likelihood of changing decisions when presented with additional information. Findings indicated that most students do not change their stance after reading additional evidence. Students were more likely to change their decisions about issues that they cared least about than about issues that they cared most about. Implications for science teaching and learning are discussed.",Atlantic,-95.0138776,41.4036007,1

English",English,Russell Samolsky,"This project constitutes a sustained attempt to investigate the correlation between testimony and landscape. My inquiry focuses on post-World War II fiction that engages the catastrophe of Shoah in terms of a corporeal and topographical remnant. As such, it aims to engage the effaced originary event as it emerges in the post-memory narrative. The imaginative reconstruction by the second- generation witness is driven by the need to know the spatial and temporal enclosure of trauma. Landscape and topography figure prominently in my research, because post-memory looks for traces, demands a narrative map. In each of these texts, translation is a rebirth mechanism, and in each case, when translation fails and the semiotic process breaks down, the body becomes event---testimony becomes corporeal. This project also examines the way post-war authors have internalized the redrawn boundaries of nations, fleshing out the narratives only the traces of which remain. The texts of this genre attempt to speak the horrors aloud, not only to speak the horror on the behalf of the witnesses, but also to situate themselves in the event they were powerless to effect. The nature of witness testimony as translation becomes most evident when the novel itself undergoes the process of translation from one language into another. My dissertation engages the mimesis of narrative translation and the act of second-generation testimony, demonstrating that translation and topography function as active modes of memory. I elaborate on my theoretical position in detail in Chapter 1, before pursuing a close reading of Victor Koz'ko's Trial in Sloboda , Primo Levi's short story ""The Servant,"" Elie Wiesel's The Golem: the Story of a Legend As Told by Elie Wiesel , Bernard Otterman's Golem of Auschwitz and finally, Jonathan Safran Foer's Everything is Illuminated.",Auschwitz,19.2097782,50.0343982,1

Earth Science",Earth Science,Susannah M. Porter,"The first is a systematic study of the diverse and well-preserved, organic-walled microfossil assemblage of the Alinya Formation of eastern Officer Basin, Australia. The use of scanning electron microscopy (SEM) revealed an unexpected level of morphological detail not visible in transmitted light microscopy and led to the recognition of new species and emendation of existing species as well as establishment of degradational sequences. In total, thirty-three taxa are described here including nineteen previously named forms, five newly described species and two new combinations. The last of these three studies provides a broader view of the early to middle Neoproterozoic biosphere (1 Ga to 635 Ma) and describes application of the CONOP correlation and seriation algorithm to a new database of paleontological, geochemical and radiometric data. Paleobiological (first and last species appearances), geochemical and age events were placed into an ordinal sequence and calibrated to the geological time-scale to reveal a high-resolution species richness record for the first 80% of the Neoproterozoic Era. Major features of this record include an increase in species richness ~805 Ma, sustained high richness levels until a decrease ~770 Ma and a short-lived increase ~760 Ma before a steep decline ~750 Ma. The findings of the two studies described above can be placed within the context of this broader synthesis: the diverse assemblage of the Alinya Formation is representative of the richness peak between ~805 and 775 Ma and the successions recording the Sturtian glacial and interglacial assemblages in Australia and Svalbard are indicative of the extended nadir that began ~750 Ma with a recovery in species richness delayed until after the termination of the second (Marinoan) glacial event. These three studies, together, describe a broad view of the early to middle Neoproterozoic Era and detail important vignettes within that story. From a more detailed and temporally constrained record of the Neoproterozoic biosphere, relationships between biotic and abiotic events during this transformative time can become better understood. The second study describes the organic-walled microfossil assemblages from five successions that span the first (Sturtian) glaciation (~717 Ma) and interglacial interval (>635 Ma), and integrates those data with a critical evaluation of primary paleontological literature of units deposited from ~850 to 650 Ma. The described successions from Australia and Svalbard record low species richness throughout this interval and when placed in context of all available body fossil data from the mid-Neoproterozoic, indicate global species richness may have decreased much earlier than previously realized. This finding of temporal decoupling between loss of richness and glacial onset suggests the extinctions previously associated with the Snowball Earth glacial events may not have been glacially driven. The Neoproterozoic Era was one of major biotic change against a background marked by fluctuations in oceanic and atmospheric chemistry, formation and rifting of the supercontinent Rodinia, and at least two global glaciations (Snowball Earth events). Presented here are three studies of differing aspects of those biological changes.",Australia,133.775136,-25.274398,2

History",History,Harold Marcuse,"During this post-1945 phase, the group that would become known as the Danube Swabians employed various terms to identify themselves, while also having a separate terminology applied to them by the government of West Germany. These expellees did not develop a unitary group consciousness until the 1960s, when they set aside their post-Trianon identities in order to establish institutions that would preserve their cultural heritage. The first of these, the Haus der Donauschwaben in Sindelfingen, along with events such as the ""Tag der Donauschwaben"" and international fundraising efforts that encouraged a greater sense of cooperation between the separate groups catalyzed the development of a common identity. This identity remains firmly established today as the Danube Swabians continue to transfer their heritage to subsequent generations through a number of institutions. In analyzing the development of this collective consciousness, my dissertation restores the importance of self-perception among smaller displaced ethnic subgroups. In several waves during the eighteenth century about 150,000 German peasants embarked down the Danube River from Swabia to reclaim marshland recently reconquered from the Ottoman Turks by the Habsburg Monarchy. Nearly two centuries later their descendants fled and were expelled back into Austria and Germany in the aftermath of the Nazi occupation of that same region from 1941 to 1944. When they first arrived in Germany they self-identified as Yugoslavian-, Hungarian- and Romanian-Germans, according to the national states formed by the 1920 Treaty of Trianon governing the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. By 1967, however, they had adopted a unitary identity as Danube Swabians in their homeland of West Germany. This dissertation explores the evolution of this identity through four phases in an effort to understand how this group consciousness formed. The first phase began in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries when ""Swabian"" settlers from various German principalities traveled down the Danube and settled in Habsburg lands as imperial subjects. The second phase occurred after the post-World War I collapse of Austria-Hungary when status as a national minority conferred political advantages in the successor states of Yugoslavia, Hungary and Romania during the interwar years. The third phase witnessed the widespread adoption of National Socialism and the interruption of this national development via the flight and expulsion of the ethnic German populations across eastern Europe as a result of the Second World War. The main focus of this study examines the fourth phase as these three post-Trianon ethnic German subgroups recovered from their reverse migration to the Federal Republic.",Austria,14.550072,47.516231,1

Bosco,"The findings illuminate how compound residents perceive their environments at various scales, underscore the variegated impacts of compound living on place attachment, sense of community, and social networks, and highlight how mobility (within and beyond Bahrain) influences these social dimensions of compound living. Finally, challenging notions that residential segregation necessarily limits social interactions, I contend that segregation is not as absolute as it may initially seem; the formation of social ties across compound walls illustrates how the built environment influences the social environments of compound residents, but does not determine them. As residential segregation engenders complex and multifaceted social effects, the findings bring into relief the ways in which various social, cultural, and demographic factors interact with the built environment to shape residents' experiences. This dissertation foregrounds social processes in concert with urban phenomena and contributes to understandings of urban and social dynamics in the Gulf city at a time when the Gulf states have become important global focal points for processes of urbanization and labor migration. Rapid and radical socioeconomic transformations have accompanied the development of the hydrocarbon-exporting economies of the Arab Gulf states. The six Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states are some of the largest recipients of labor migrants in the world, and the region has the second highest rate of urbanization in the world. Given these changes, it is critical to understand the urban impacts of migration flows that have dramatically increased the proportion of foreigners in the cities of the Gulf. This dissertation examines the urban and social geographies associated with gated housing compounds (developments geared toward white collar expatriate workers) in Bahrain. I investigate how associated productions of urban space and social processes of community formation of compound residents relate to and influence one another. My analysis is based on interviews with expatriates living in compounds and other residential accommodations. I also interviewed academics, planners, and landlords, and conducted surveys, participant observation, archival research, and field surveys.

History",History,Mario T. Garcia,"The history of race, politics, and civil rights in California's Central Valley is an important yet understudied aspect of multiracial history in the American West. Kern County and the city of Bakersfield were critical epicenters of civil rights activism during the twentieth century. Simultaneously, an equally active and sometimes hostile, conservative resistance toward labor and civil rights existed in the region. In the immediate post-World War II era, Mexican Americans built racial coalitions with African Americans and white liberals to challenge racial segregation and discrimination in housing and employment. In the ensuing decades, the war on poverty, farmworker, and Chicana/o power movements impacted racial coalition building and civil rights reform in complex ways, including struggles over increased political representation for racial minorities, expansion of rural-migrant health care, and school desegregation. Since World War II through the rise of the modern political right, Mexican immigrants and their descendants shaped rural and urban civil rights reform in California's interior. This dissertation draws upon several archival repositories related to labor and civil rights history in California's Central Valley, including the collected papers of the United Farm Workers (UFW), the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF), the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Region I, West Coast Branch (NAACP-WC), the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), as well as previously unexamined personal paper collections of Bakersfield civil rights leaders and politicians.

These variables relate to the modernist, ethnoculturalist, instrumentalist, and constructivist theories of nations. The effect of these variables is tested by using control variables such as region of origin, settlement type, age, gender, religion, and education. The methods used consist in the analysis of secondary sources in order to measure how historical evidence can substantiate the above mentioned variables. Another method is a survey conducted among Belarusians to measure the influence of these variables. Historical evidence indicates that the absence of an historical narrative acceptable to all Belarusians undermined a common identity, and that a civic model of identity favorable to Russia became more accepted than the nationalist identity model based on ethnicity. Evidence also shows that state consolidation reinforced Belarusians' will to wrestle independence from Russia. Survey results in turn indicate a direct relationship between the type of national identity and from which state Belarusians want sovereignty. Civic identity influences support for sovereignty from a political state, like the USSR, while ethnic identity influences support for sovereignty from an ethnic state like Russia. Most of all, attitudes favorable to nationalist symbols emerged as having the most consistent effect on support for sovereignty. While Belarusians do not consider ethnic ancestry as a criterion for nationality they favor an identity model that can be termed ""national-cultural.""",Belarus,27.953389,53.709807,1

Comparative Literature",Comparative Literature,Rita Raley,"My project argues that the U.S.-Mexico border is an assemblage of medial forms that are communicated in multiple media without superseding one another. For example, the border is, at once, a graphic design on numerous maps; a symbolic construction in copious literary and legal textual media; a series of fences erected in various terrestrial media; a photographic icon in still and moving pictures; an architectural design; a painted figure; the list goes on. As an assortment of medial forms, The U.S.-Mexico border does not refer to the United States and Mexico as the subjects of its mediation, but rather produces the United States and Mexico as subjects, which thereon depend on the border for their subjectivity, as the border depends on the nations for its continued existence. The United States and Mexico cannot be articulated from or with one another without what media theorist Bernhard Siegert calls ""concrete practices and symbolic operations"" to process their articulation, operations which are ultimately expressed in medial forms, whether lines on maps, untranslatable proper nouns, legal writ, poetic verses, or fences. In drawing connections between the borders produced in different media, I am examining borders as media systems that correspond to different cultural techniques and produce distinct political subjectivities. To envision this network, I develop the concept of the hyperborder, which I define as a border that extends across media. The hyperborder is a framework that links together different mediated borders, and that proposes and examines epistemological connections between them. The hyperborder is a way of attaining a global and comparative view of borders, while at the same time accounting for their different and irreducible media forms. In this project, I examine border forms primarily in three media: literary media, including poetry and prose; cartographic media, with an attention to different cultural meanings of mapmaking; and infrastructural media, particularly types of fencing. My methodology for researching and comparing these different media forms combines archival and participatory research. In order to study textual borders---those found in literary and cartographic media---I have relied on archival research carried out at UC Berkeley's Bancroft Library and in the Special Collections of UCSB's Davidson Library. My desire to account for the location of media has also compelled me to research media forms in the field, so to speak. My analysis of Indigenous mapping in Chapter Two is informed by conversations that I have had with Jim Enote, director of the A:shiwi A:wan Museum and Heritage Center at Zuni Pueblo. My analysis of the U.S.-Mexico border fence in Chapter Three is grounded in physical fieldwork at the site of the fence, particularly with Friends of Friendship Park in San Diego and Tijuana. My combination of archival and participatory research practices allows for a wider view of the border. It also situates my project in numerous academic disciplines and fields, including Comparative Literature, Media Studies, Border Studies, History, Chicana/o Studies, and Indigenous Studies. In developing the comparative framework of the hyperborder, I am making use of the interdisciplinary potential of Comparative Literature, albeit in a way that problematizes the discipline by including what may not be considered ""literary"" in my comparisons. Although originating in Comparative Literature, my methodology has wandered, through the discipline's encyclopedic opening, into Media Studies, where I can compare objects like those listed above through concepts like cultural techniques and knowledge systems. I am mainly applying my Media Studies and Comparative Literature approach in order to intervene in the interdisciplinary field of Border Studies. As an academic specialization, Border Studies leans toward political and social sciences, and often leads to bureaucratic professionalization. My project complements and challenges a social sciences-oriented Border Studies with a humanities-based approach that insists on the media specificity of borders. Similarly, my project is engaged with rethinking the paradigmatic borderlands, as conceptualized by historian Herbert Eugene Bolton in the early 20th century. While my dissertation is grounded in borderlands historiography, my sense of History is directed toward a borderlands of media---toward medial differences, and how they determine boundaries in the symbolic and in the real. A major assertion in my project is that cultural differences correlate to media operations. I thus pay critical attention to the disciplinary frameworks of Chicana/o and Latina/o Studies, and to how their disciplinary stances and social frameworks are articulated with those of History and Border Studies. While older center-periphery historiographies relegated Chicana/o cultural production to regional margins, my project marks how Chicana/o texts address these problematics in media-specific ways.

Film and Media Studies",Film and Media Studies,Bhaskar Sarkar,"This project investigates media's role in technoscience controversies by focusing on four case studies from India: issues of chronic toxicity in the continuing aftermath of the Bhopal gas disaster; disputes over regulating emission of potentially carcinogenic electromagnetic radiation by mobile towers; battles over building atomic power plants between nuclear nationalists on one hand and anti-nuclear pacifists and affected local communities on the other; public deliberations leading to a moratorium on genetically modified eggplants. I do not suggest that each technology determines its own particular discourse. Rather, I focus on how science as culture interacts with media discourses and cultural values: newsworthiness, nationalism, security, framing, globalization, and democracy. The debates I explore are not restricted to ""objective"" scientific processes, but are instead marked by incommensurable values, competing expertise, and radical uncertainties. These controversies spiral out in the public domain, where the expressive and persuasive characteristics of media prove crucial. A technoscience public consisting of--scientists, activists, policy-makers, and affected patients--that gathers around a disruptive technology, such as a nuclear reactor or cell tower antennae, cannot be materialized or imagined without the circulation of discourses through the process of mediation. Thus, technoscience publics and media publics intersect and reconfigure each other, and in each chapter, I trace the different unfolding debates by tracking the dynamic reconfigurations of the ""mediated technoscience publics."" Through an elaboration of the concept ""mediated technoscience publics"" my dissertation provides both a theoretical vocabulary and a methodological approach to study media and technoscience/environmental debates together. I emerge with notions of media that at once retain the specificity of a particular media format like a talk show or a media object like a cell phone, and yet are not tied to any one of them. I conceptualize media landscapes as circulatory systems of signs and signals, discourses and matter, representations and resonances. My approach emphasizes close examination of media practices (Ursula Rao, Brian Larkin) and performative mediation (Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska) to theorize the materiality of scientific knowledge production and publics (Karen Barad, Alexander Kluge, Jane Bennett).",Bhopal,77.412615,23.2599333,1

Film and Media Studies",Film and Media Studies,Michael Curtin,"How does hope emerge amidst a hopeless situation, freedom amidst apartheid, equality amidst inequality? In the context of Palestine, where is utopian located? A possible answer to these enigmas presented itself in a Freedom March organized by a group of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron in March 2013. Carrying Palestinian flags, they crossed into a forbidden zone, boldly walking into the section of the street designated for Jewish settlers only. On their faces were masks of Martin Luther King, Jr., in their hands were portraits of Rosa Parks, and on their shirts were four English words: ""I have a dream"". By resurrecting the imagery and iconography of the US Black Freedom Movement, these Palestinians were drawing new, imaginative constellations of counterhegemonic protest and forging transnational links of solidarity across time and space. The demonstrators thus staged a disruption. They temporarily interrupted the status quo and transgressed the rules and regulations of the hegemonic order. As a result, they were swiftly apprehended by uniformed members of the Israeli Defense Forces. As if to reenact a scene from Birmingham or Selma, the soldiers ripped the flags from the protesters' hands and placed them in handcuffs. With MLK masks still on their faces, the demonstrators were loaded onto trucks and quickly taken out of sight. The protest was thus brought to a halt almost as soon as it had begun. In this way, an attempt was made to contain the disruption, to restore the ruling regime of hierarchy and segregation, and to sew up the tear that the demonstrators had ripped in the symbolic universe. But while the protesters themselves could be forcibly removed from the scene, the images they left behind could not be so easily erased. Photographs of the demonstration were immediately published on the Internet and circulated on social media websites. Like apparitions from another dimension, these images demonstrate that another world is possible, a world without ethnic- or religious-determined divisions, a world without apartheid walls, security fences, or segregated streets. They show that the unthinkable can be made thinkable, that the invisible can be made visible, and that the impossible can be made possible. This staged news spectacle represents just one example of a larger trend. In Equality in the Shadows, I look at the role of film, media, and culture in the Palestinian struggle against Zionist colonization. Basing my dissertation on both Edward Said's notion of ""the Palestinian Idea"" and Jacques Ranciere's subversive redefinition of equality, I aim to show how through film and media, Palestinian liberation is not only a dream for a far-off and distant future but something that already exists in the present. While my dissertation has a strong foundation in film and media studies, I am drawing on a range of approaches, and I believe my work is relevant to scholars in a variety of disciplines including Black studies, cultural studies, Global and International Studies, Middle Eastern studies, politics, and sociology. Each chapter utilizes the work of several critical theorists, and I am attempting to put Palestinian media in conversation with writers such as Ernst Bloch, James Cone, Joan Copjec, Sigmund Freud, Stuart Hall, Dick Hebdige, C.L.R.

Anthropology",Anthropology,Steven J. C. Gaulin,"Human voices are sexually dimorphic in at least three ways: males have lower fundamental frequency, lower and more closely spaced formant structure, and less fundamental frequency variation. The overarching goal of the present research is to understand the ultimate and ontogenetic origins of human vocal dimorphism using the theory of sexual selection. Outstanding questions can be organized into three general lines of inquiry: 1) Have male voices been subject to both intra- and intersexual selection? Or has one process dominated? 2) What does a masculine voice signal? That is, why would potential mates and competitors attend to vocal characteristics? 3) What constraints ensure that vocal signals remain honest, or at least honest enough to warrant attention? Part A (Articles 1 and 2) targets question 1 by examining reactions to masculine voice features among college-aged men and women. Part B (Articles 3 through 6) primarily targets questions 2 and 3 by studying individual differences in vocal maturation among Bolivian adolescents. Results include several important findings. US college-age men's mating success (Article 2) was better predicted by a strong correlate of vocal dominance (F 0 variation; Article 1) than by a strong correlate of vocal attractiveness (mean F0; Article 1), suggesting that intrasexual selection may have been an important selection pressure on the evolution of men's vocal traits, and may be more important in that regard than female choice. Listeners may attend to vocal frequencies because they signal honest, non-redundant information about male strength that cannot be ascertained from visual inspection of body size (i.e., height or adiposity; Article 4). Tsimane males experience later voice change and have higher adult voices compared with North Americans (Article 3), suggesting that a higher-pitched voice reveals a developmental history of energetic constraints. Not only is testosterone strongly related to development of fundamental and formant frequencies, but it mediates the relationship between energetic condition and vocal characteristics (Article 5). These findings provide evidence for a costly signaling model of masculine voices; males in better condition have greater resources to invest in testosterone-dependent traits like the voice.",Bolivia,-63.588653,-16.290154,7

Anthropology",Anthropology,Michael Gurven,"Male status hierarchies are a human universal. In all societies, men with a greater ability to inflict costs (i.e. dominance) or confer benefits (i.e. prestige) gain differential access to contested resources. However, our knowledge of how human societies compare in the determinants and outcomes of status is limited. Ethnographies are typically anecdotal; they explore the link between only one particular trait and social status, or lack a longitudinal design to assess causal relationships. Filling this knowledge gap in fast-disappearing small-scale societies is critical, given their relevance to understanding human evolution and transitions in socio-political complexity over human history. Among the Tsimane horticulturalists of Bolivia, I find that there is a high level of inequality in status acquisition across men, even though they lack formal, authoritative government. The consensus-based decision-making in small-scale societies does not preclude significant inter-individual power differentials beyond those due to age and sex. I compare status acquisition in different domains (dyadic fighting ability, getting one's way in groups, community-wide influence, and respect from peers), which differ in the extent to which they reflect dominance versus prestige. Physical size best predicts fighting ability while social support from allies, both kin and non-kin, best predicts success in the other status domains. Market-related skills are growing contributors to community-wide influence, which is more unequally distributed in more modernized Tsimane villages. Greater access to private, material wealth in these more modernized villages does not undercut the sharing of food and labor across households, which are important means of securing allies and, ultimately, influence. I also evaluate the reproductive outcomes of status acquisition. I find that more influential Tsimane men have more surviving offspring within their marital unions, due to marrying young wives and to the support of allies, but they also experience more extra-marital affairs. The strong relationship between status and fertility (both legitimate and illegitimate) across small-scale societies suggests men do not pursue status solely to improve their access to mates but also to benefit their families.

At the national level, government officials and doctors conjoined revolutionary rhetoric and public health programs. Local communities articulated their own version of this rhetoric to demand the government fulfill its revolutionary promises by providing health services. Therefore, public health provides a framework for examining social relations, identity formation, and the contestation of power in modern Bolivia.",Bolivia,-63.588653,-16.290154,7

It follows with a detailed narrative of the three riots in the cities mentioned. Then it offers an analysis of the unique role that abolitionist women played in these three riots, by unintentionally inciting the mob as they stepped out of their customary, socially sanctioned roles. A detailed analysis of the vital role of the anti-abolitionist media in inciting to violence and the abolitionists' response to it follows. The dissertation concludes with an analysis of the reasons for the decline of anti-abolitionist violence. It also offers a succinct look into the relationship between fear of miscegenation and lynching, asserting that the southern lynching mobs were driven by the same fear that fueled the mobs in the three northern cities examined. A frequently occurring disturbance among northern urban centers in antebellum America was racially-motivated mob violence against abolitionists and African Americans. My dissertation undertakes comparative analysis of incidents of anti-abolitionist and anti-Black mob violence in three major Northeastern cities: New York, Boston, and Philadelphia. I propose that the major cause for these incidents was fear of the social/romantic and/or sexual mixing of African Americans and Whites. To research this question, I examined data collected from primary sources stored in or held by the Rare Books and Manuscripts of the Library of Congress, the Boston Public Library, the New York Historical Society, the Antiquarian Society, the Library Company of Philadelphia, and Syracuse University, and included digitized newspapers of the period. Published primary sources were also consulted, as well as secondary sources on or related to the subject. I was impressed by the relationship I found between some of the antebellum violence against abolitionists and their supporters, and the repeated expressed fear and hatred of amalgamation (whether real or perceived as real). Even though others had mentioned the possibility of this relationship, no one had explored it in depth. At the end of the research phase of this work I saw how fear and hatred of amalgamation/miscegenation arose again in the late 19th century and the first five decades of the 20th century, thus attesting to the power of an ideology to foster violence.",Boston,-71.0588801,42.3600825,1

Economics",Economics,Robert T. Deacon,"Institutions, as mechanisms of social order, often constrain the behavior of individuals within a society. Political institutions constrain the behavior of politicians, financial institutions constrain the behavior of businesses and payment processors and social institutions often constrain the behavior of individuals. These institutions often play an important role in constraining activities that may be seen as illicit or unwanted and careful analysis of these constraints can allow researchers to learn more about activities that are often hidden or go unreported. This dissertation explores the role of institutional constraints on unwanted behavior by studying deforestation in Brazil and Malawi as well as underground activity in fraudulent software sales. These cases share the commonality that they are influenced by institutional constraints. Politicians in Brazil are constrained by reelection incentives, perpetrators of fraudulent antivirus software are constrained by payment processors and the cultural practice of ethnic favoritism in public good provision leads to particular ethnic groups in Malawi receiving much more fertilizer subsidies than others. The first chapter examines deforestation in Brazil. Local political authority (formal or informal) over natural resources may create rents for politicians. The political decision to use or allocate resources involves balancing private rents with reelection prospects. I examine the case of deforestation in Brazil and a presidential decree granting the federal government the authority to punish counties that failed to limit total deforestation within their borders. This collective punishment aimed to generate pressure on local politicians to slow deforestation. Using binding term limits as a source of variation in reelection eligibility, I find eligibility has no effect on deforestation prior to the decree. After the decree, reelection eligible mayors reduced annual deforestation 10% more than mayors ineligible for reelection. These findings are consistent with the equilibrium outcome of a lobbying model. Policies such as sanctions, which target the electorate in order to influence political behavior, may be less effective when politicians are not accountable to voters. The second chapter examines Fake antivirus (AV) programs which have been utilized to defraud millions of computer users into paying as much as one hundred dollars for a phony software license. As a result, fake AV software has evolved into one of the most lucrative criminal operations on the Internet. In this chapter, we examine the operations of three large scale fake AV businesses, lasting from three months to more than two years. More precisely, we present the results of our analysis on a trove of data obtained from several backend servers that the cybercriminals used to drive their scam operations. Our investigations reveal that these three fake AV businesses had earned a combined revenue of more than $130 million dollars. A particular focus of our analysis is on the financial and economic aspects of the scam, which involves legitimate credit card networks as well as more dubious payment processors. In particular, we present an economic model that demonstrates that fake AV companies are actively monitoring the refunds (chargebacks) that customers demand from their credit card providers. When the number of chargebacks increases in a short interval, the fake AV companies react to customer complaints by granting more refunds. This lowers the rate of chargebacks and ensures that a fake AV company can stay in business for a longer period of time. However, this behavior also leads to unusual patterns in chargebacks, which can potentially be leveraged by vigilant payment processors and credit card companies to identify and ban fraudulent firms. This chapter is joint work with Brett Stone-Gross, Richard Kremmerer, Christopher Kruegel, Douglas Steigerwald, and Giovanni Vigna and was published as Stone-Gross et al. (2013). The final chapter returns to deforestation and studies it in the context of agriculture in Malawi. The effect of development policies on the environment is often ambiguous ex ante. Programs designed to improve agricultural productivity may increase deforestation by raising the marginal productivity of agricultural land, thus increasing the demand for land clearing. However, in a setting of subsistence farming on unproductive land, increasing agricultural productivity may reduce the need to shift cultivation to maintain the desired yields. This chapter examines the impact of agricultural subsidies on deforestation in Malawi by leveraging ethnic favoritism in government resource allocation. By exploiting a change in the ethnicity of the Malawi president following the 2004 election, we show that coethnic districts received more fertilizer subsidies and experienced significant declines in deforestation compared to districts with other predominant ethnicities. This paper studies a case in which poverty alleviation programs have beneficial environ- mental impacts demonstrating that, in certain contexts, input subsidies may provide a 'win-win' scenario.

English",English,Shirley G. Lim,"Unsettling Solidarities examines Asian North American and Indigenous solidarities, alliances, and interactions imagined in the contemporary literatures of these two communities, tracing how these moments of literary contact reveal the vexed dynamics of race and resistance after the mid-twentieth century. Emerging out of anti-colonial and anti-racist movements of the 1950-70s, narratives by Maxine Hong Kingston, Joy Kogawa, Karen Tei Yamashita, and Leslie Marmon Silko grapple with the limits of identity-based cultural politics, articulating in its their place different collectivities and ethical relations that can account for the increasing stratifications of power within and across racial identities. The dissertation tracks the aesthetically diverse ways these writers imagine their own and each other's communities within their revised cultural politics, and argues that the ambivalent depictions register these communities' differential yet mutually constitutive histories and critical visions for social justice. Recent scholarship in Critical Race and Ethnic Studies has posited a comparative framework---within and between communities of difference---for apprehending the shifting localities, agents, and processes of settler colonial distributions of life and (vulnerabilities to) death. Such analytics have become urgent within the context of (neo)liberal multiculturalism and its selective recognition of cultural difference as the condition of possibility for new global economic restructuring for inequities. Asian/Indigenous convergences, in particular, bring to the fore how civil rights frameworks can elide Indigenous experiences, perpetuating discursive erasures of settler colonial conditions. The dissertation's project foregrounds these tensions, attending to their biopolitical and affective dimensions, as they are revealed, negotiated, and metonymically reproduced within the narratives. By investigating the intersecting affective economies of Asian/Indigenous interaction, imagined at various geopolitical sites (such as Hawai`i, the U.S./Mexico Border, Canada, and Brazil), this study connects intimate and localized specificities of racial formations to broader networks of settler national configurations.",Brazil,-51.92528,-14.235004,20

Geography",Geography,Leila MV Carvalho,"The dominant mode of coupled variability over the South Atlantic Ocean is known as ""South Atlantic Dipole"" (SAD) and is characterized by a dipole in sea surface temperature (SST) anomalies with centers over the tropical and the extratropical South Atlantic. Previous studies have shown that variations in SST related to SAD modulate large-scale patterns of precipitation over the Atlantic Ocean. Here we show that variations in the South Atlantic SST are associated with changes in daily precipitation over eastern South America. This study is based on observational and regional atmospheric modeling. Rain gauge precipitation, satellite derived sea surface temperature and reanalysis data are used to investigate the variability of the subtropical and tropical South Atlantic and impacts on precipitation. SAD phases are assessed by performing Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) analysis of sea level pressure and SST anomalies. We show that during neutral El Nino-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events, SAD plays an important role in modulating cyclogenesis and the characteristics of the South Atlantic Convergence Zone (SACZ). Positive SST anomalies over the extratropical South Atlantic (SAD negative phase) are related to increased cyclogenesis near southeast Brazil as well as the migration of extratropical cyclones further north. As a consequence, these systems organize convection and increase precipitation over eastern South America. Numerical experiments forced with prescribed SST anomalies showed that even though the Atlantic SST affects the position of the cyclone associated with the SACZ, the atmospheric response and precipitation patters over land were opposite from the observational results. On the other hand, experiments forced with prescribed anomalous driving fields showed that the atmospheric component of SAD plays a significant role for the right position and intensity of precipitation associated with the SACZ. SAD negative anomalies provide the low-level and upper-level atmospheric support for the intensification of the cyclone at surface and for the increase in precipitation over the land portion of the SACZ. Therefore, the numerical experiments suggest that, during ENSO neutral conditions, the SACZ precipitation variability associated with SAD is largely dependent on the atmospheric variability rather than the underlying SST.",Brazil,-51.92528,-14.235004,20

A multi-faceted body of work is described here, addressing three major issues that employ and advance remote sensing techniques for the study of Amazonia and other tropical rainforest regions. In Chapter 2, canopy reflectance modeling and satellite observations were used to quantify the effect of epiphylls on remote sensing of humid forests. Modeling simulations demonstrated sensitivity of canopy-level near infrared and green reflectance to epiphylls on leaves. Time series of Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectrometer (MODIS) data corroborated the modeling results, suggesting a degree of coupling between epiphyll cover and vegetation indices which must be accounted for when using optical remote sensing in humid forests. In Chapter 4, 11 years (2000--2010) of MODIS land surface temperature (LST) data covering the entire Amazon basin were used to ascertain the role of heat stress during droughts in 2005 and 2010. Preliminary accuracy assessments showed that LST data provided reasonably accurate estimates of daytime air temperatures (RMSE = 1.45C; Chapter 3). There were moderate to strong correlations between LST-based air temperature estimates and tower measurements (mean r = 0.64), illustrating a sensitivity to temporal variability. During both droughts, MODIS LST data detected anomalously high daytime and nighttime canopy temperatures throughout drought-affected regions. Multivariate linear models of LST and precipitation anomalies explained 65.1% of the variability in forest biomass losses, as determined from a wide network of forest inventory plots. These results suggest that models should incorporate both heat and moisture to predict drought effects on tropical forests. In Chapter 5, I performed high spatial and temporal resolution modeling of carbon stocks and fluxes in the state of Rondonia, Brazil for the period 1985--2009. Based on this analysis, Rondonia contributed _4% of pan-tropical humid forest deforestation emissions while carbon uptake by secondary forest was negligible due to limited spatial extent and high turnover rates.

Geography",Geography,Stuart Aitken,"In a span of two years the City of Rio de Janeiro will have hosted two of the biggest sporting events in the world, the 2014 World Cup and 2016 Summer Olympics. As I argue throughout this dissertation, the potential these sporting mega-events hold for attracting capital investment to the city is immense. And, as such, the City of Rio de Janeiro has unveiled a dizzying array of new urban policy initiatives designed to prepare the city for the mega-event and in the process make the city an attractive space for international investors. The consequences of these policies, I argue, is irrevocably altering the socio-spatial structure of the city creating new landscapes for tourist consumption and zones for real estate speculation. In the process, the City of Rio de Janeiro is permanently reconfiguring its nearly 450-year-old urban settlement pattern characterized by a relatively high-percentage of low-income residents occupying residencies in and near the urban core. This dissertation examines how this process is unfolding across the city. My findings suggest low-income residents are being pushed to the periphery of the city through both 'hard' displacement (forced evictions) as well as 'soft' forms of displacement, including gentrification. This research specifically focuses on the latter, exploring the various ways in which gentrified landscapes in Rio de Janeiro's sporting mega-event city have been produced. My research findings suggest a myriad of forces, including 'exceptional' urban policies, the commodification of Afro-Brazilian culture, and community 'pacifying police,' have been instrumental in producing gentrified landscapes in the city. Yet, by exploring gentrification in a number of spatial contexts over my five years of fieldwork, I suggest these processes unfold in a spatially uneven and place-contingent ways. I thus argue gentrification in Rio de Janeiro is actualized through a series of geographically unique connective processes, rather any one homogenizing force. This dissertation also examines how residents at risk of losing their homes resist gentrification and displacement. Through in-depth interviews with activists and months of participant observation, I point to the importance of place-based social movements asserting their 'right to stay put' through vigorous discursive and material defenses of their communities. These activists work to shift the production of locality in their favor so their communities might become viewed as a 'home' rather than an exploitable commodity.",Brazil,-51.92528,-14.235004,20

Lastly, this research suggests that sustaining religiously fueled conflicts amongst the Afro-Brazilian community is ultimately a political tool that destabilizes progress towards a unified movement against similar structural social problems.",Brazil,-51.92528,-14.235004,20

Spanish and Portuguese",Spanish and Portuguese,Ellen McCracken,"To date, no lengthy study has examined queer sexualities and space in Latin American film. In three chapters organized around different spatial scales, I theorize how spatiality reflects and affects the development and expression of queer sexuality in eight films from throughout Latin America. In the first chapter, I explore public and private spaces in relation to queer sexuality in Francisco J. Lombardi's No se lo digas a nadie (Peru 1998), Tomas Gutierrez Alea and Juan Carlos Tabio's Fresa y chocolate (Cuba 1993), and Jorge Fons's El callejon de los milagros (Mexico 1994). I argue that despite their attempts to carve out private spaces---with varying degrees of success---the queer characters in these films are not able to escape the influence of the public sphere and heteronormativity. In Chapter Two, I examine the relationship between queer sexualities and city space. I argue that in Enrique Bochichio's El cuarto de Leo (Uruguay 2009) Montevideo is presented as a sort of utopia, a liberating space for individuals who may choose to come out of the closet. By conflating homosexuality with criminality, Marcelo Pineyro's Plata quemada (Argentina 2000), on the other hand, depicts the traditionally oppressive, unsustainable relationship between the city and homosexuals. In Chapter Three, I explore the use of the body as a space for working through issues of queer sexuality. In the films that I analyze, there is an increasing degree of materialization of the body as space. In Javier Fuentes-Leon's Contracorriente (Peru 2009), the ghost of the protagonist's dead lover serves as a sort of mirror that helps the protagonist cope with his sexuality. In Karim Ainouz's Madame Sata (Brazil 2002), issues of sexual identity, gender, race, and class are consolidated in the body of a cross-dressing performer. In Lucia Puenzo's XXY (Argentina 2007), the concern for the body as space is materialized to the greatest extent. The protagonist is an intersexed adolescent whose body serves as a space that represents not only her internal struggles, but also those of her parents and the society within which she does not neatly fit.",Brazil,-51.92528,-14.235004,20

Taking these reviews to encapsulate the productions' reception, scholars have agreed that the series reinforced hegemonic hierarchies between spectators and performers.

History",History,Patricia Cline Cohen,"This dissertation examines the United States-based communitarian socialists known as the Fourierists as a piece of the larger international Fourierist movement, highlighting the numerous points of contact between Fourierists and their counterparts on each side of the Atlantic. My goal is to understand Fourierism as a multinational movement that sparked an international conversation among its members, which made it one of the most cosmopolitan of the reform movements to emerge from the social tumult in the 1840s. Its Janus-faced focus on the U.S. reform landscape and fixed connection with European Fourierists made Fourierism arguably the most dynamic reform movement of the nineteenth century. It is a story of connectivity among individuals who believed they possessed a new moral framework for remaking the world. The theories of the French social philosopher Charles Fourier also helped change the course of antebellum reform in the United States by introducing important themes and an entirely new vocabulary to the reform lexicon. The strength of the Fourierist press in the United States, especially the celebrated journal The Harbinger, highlights the movement's fingerprint on the course of American journalism. I will explore how and why this movement spread so far from the 1830s-1850s, and how these activists transcended national identity in order to realize the plan of perfecting the world's ills through the adoption of Fourier's experimental living arrangements. As a movement based on experiment, exchange, and collaboration, Fourierism intermingled freely with other mid-century reform movements including abolition, women's rights, free love, as well as workingmen's and other socialist movements. Traveling Fourierist leaders, the growth of Fourierist journalism, and the community of early Fourierists in New York City fostered complex identities in those at the heart of the movement. Their involvement in multiple causes demonstrates the international roots of mid-nineteenth-century reform. While adherents in each nation adapted Fourier's message to their own specific national context, the fluidity of the larger philosophy transcended borders, helping create an international reform identity in an age usually best known for a parochial nationalism. Using archival sources and published journals and periodicals from France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, this dissertation follows a chronological analysis of the movement's international layers. I examine the period from the movement's inception in the 1830s to its height in 1846, focusing on Fourierism's importation to the United States and its evolution from a cosmopolitan group of European and Francophone expatriates in New York City to a more Americanized version championed by Horace Greeley and Albert Brisbane with intentional appeal to workingmen. I also focus on the decline of Fourierism in the late 1840s, the pivotal year of the French Revolution of 1848, and the growth of the Free Love movement from Fourierism's ashes in the early 1850s. This dissertation compels scholars to look closer at the Fourierist movement as a case study in successfully changing the vocabulary of social reformers, bringing attention to the problems inherent within industrial capitalism, offering an inclusive approach to labor reform which included women's rights, and an alternative to the bourgeois home. Fourierism was at the center of a dialogue on gender norms and sexuality that would ultimately include members of the organized women's rights movement and advocates of the controversial free love movement. The Fourierist movement's communal ethos promised to improve the lives of women by ameliorating the drudgery of housework and providing shared child-rearing opportunities. Additionally, Charles Fourier's highly controversial theories on sexual liberation and marriage reform led some Fourierists to challenge reigning sexual mores. Studying the works of the Fourierists reveal new insights into the attitudes about gender and sexuality within the larger world of mid-nineteenth-century reform in the United States and Europe. Fourierism inspired a debate about gender, marriage, and religion that changed the language and tactics of mid-nineteenth-century reform.",Brisbane,153.0251235,-27.4697707,1

I investigate how black laboring bodies claimed agency and forged new communities on Broadway stages over ten decades, despite other scholars' notions of Broadway as inherently ""white space"". My method combines ethnography, spatial-visual and semiotic analysis to explore how the theatrical black body has re-shaped American social and political imagination through musical stage performances. These performances, in turn, re-circulate in global networks in ways that both challenge and re-affirm the domination of American cultural influences and the ""Otherness"" of black Africanity within the genre of the musical. Ultimately, I demonstrate that there is a long and continuing tradition within the commercial American theater of utilizing a staged vision of Africa for various ends. As significant as it is to acknowledge the challenging, bold gestures made by a number of Broadway's theater artists, it is also important to show, finally, that the entire trajectory of musical theater has developed in conversation with an African Other and an imagined African space (be it a threatening pagan jungle or prehistoric paradise). No matter how progressive, most musical theater histories to date still affirm black musical theater and artists as an additive, rather than reexamining musical theater history as a conversation about race from its inception.

Music",Music,David Paul,"In the early 1980s, arts professionals from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Rockefeller Foundation, and OPERA America expressed concern with the scarcity of new American operas and the stagnation of standard European repertory. Many believed the solution was to borrow from the vital world of American avant-garde music theater occurring outside of opera establishments, most successfully represented by Philip Glass. This dissertation uses the reception of Glass as a lens to examine the discussion transpiring among members of these arts organizations, showing how the various interlocutors were critical for a sudden flourishing of American opera. I focus on the role adventurous impresarios have played in American discourse about opera, promoting ideological orientations and controlling the resources that sustain artist reputations. I show how Harvey Lichtenstein at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Robert Brustein at the American Repertory Theater, and David Gockley at the Houston Grand Opera challenged the role of opera in American culture, lauding Glass's synthesis of popular and high art. Drawing from interviews and archival materials, this narrative charts interactions between Glass and the network of patrons, institutions, directors, critics, and performers who supported and influenced his work. I examine the meanings these people ascribed to Glass's music as a cultural phenomenon, situating their discourse within the context of the broader issues that vexed American opera. Exploring the activities of arts administrators provides a new entree into the larger world of American experimental music that nuances the ""maverick"" label that has so often been attached to Glass. As I contend, the various aesthetic frameworks that sustained the agendas of Lichtenstein, Brustein, and Gockley were at least as important in shaping public perceptions about Glass as anything the composer has said about himself. Because of these impresarios, Glass's operas became a model for innovation, bringing in record box office receipts and revitalizing American opera.",Brooklyn,-73.9441579,40.6781784,1

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Alexander R.

A spike in nanodiamond presence at the Younger Dryas boundary has been reported in sediments from the Bull Creek valley in Oklahoma and used to support a recently proposed impact hypothesis. However, this record was compiled from a heterogeneous mix of sediment from different fluvial subenvironments. In order for the significance of a unique occurrence of nanodiamonds to be determined, a full appreciation of the other changes that occurred within the valley throughout its evolution must be taken into account. These changes may have impacted sediment character as well as sediment preservation and the processes governing deposition, all of which could impact nanodiamond accumulation and preservation. The purpose of this study is to build an evolutionary model for the Bull Creek valley spanning the last 16,000 years in order to place nanodiamond occurrence into stratigraphic context. Fluvial terraces were mapped and their sediments described within the valley. Results indicate the valley has undergone at least four cycles of cutting and filling, creating five sets of discontinuous fluvial terraces. The sedimentary sequence preserved in the terraces records the transition from a perennial fluvial system during the late glacial to a cool yet dry environment during the Younger Dryas, followed by an arid environment dominated by eolian processes and punctuated by flooding events. Although the sediment character of the Younger Dryas soil is unique, the occurrence of nanodiamonds within it is not.

Linguistics",Linguistics,Carol Genetti,"The most fundamental feature of Khatso is the fact that it is a pragmatics-based language, meaning that verbal semantics and discourse context are often more crucial than syntax in comprehending the language. Topic-comment structures and zero anaphora are frequent, regularly creating utterances in which key information is underspecified or absent. Some constructions, such as pragmatic agent marking, are triggered only when the context is ambiguous. And, many particles and constructions in Khatso are multifunctional, relying on context to clarify meaning. Essentially, syntax sets the stage for several potential interpretations and only the flow of information in a specific utterance points to the correct choice. Moreover, some constructions are only identifiable through contextual analysis, such as the many clause-combining structures that link phrases pragmatically without syntactic integration. Consequently, the discourse-functional approach used here has proven especially useful for painting a comprehensive picture of the Khatso language. The research and analysis presented in this dissertation differ significantly from previous efforts to describe the language. In addition to identifying the basic building blocks - phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax and the lexicon - there is an emphasis on capturing Khatso the way it is spoken in daily life. Natural language data were gathered during nearly a year of fieldwork in Xingmeng, via both audio and video recordings, creating a large multimedia corpus of the language. Transcriptions of the recordings formed the foundation for the investigation, which follows a discourse-functional approach to linguistic analysis. As a result, this grammar is the most comprehensive analysis of Khatso yet, providing an in-depth look at the features, structures and systems that interact to comprise this unique language. It is also the first major study of the language in English. Khatso (kha55tso31 [special characters omitted]; also Katso, Kazhuo [special characters omitted], Gazhuo [special characters omitted] and Yunnan Mongolian; ISO 639-3:kaf) is an endangered Ngwi (or Yi) language spoken in Xingmeng, a single farming village in Yunnan, China. Khatso speakers, who number about 5600 people, are descendants of the Mongolian soldiers Kublai Khan brought to Yunnan in the 13th century, and they still identify as Mongolian today. The language has evolved considerably through language contact, however, and is now considered part of the central branch of the Ngwi language family within the Tibeto-Burman phylum. Khatso is a tonal language that is both analytic and isolating. The phonology is similar to that of most Ngwi languages, with the exception of its relatively large eight-tone system. Tone sandhi is triggered by a variety of phonological, syntactic and discourse factors. There is very little morphology in the language, and most of the lexicon consists of monosyllabic and disyllabic monomorphemes. There is a rich classifier system, which also marks number and specific reference. Typical word order is SV/APV, though there is a great deal of flexibility in discourse. Simple noun modifiers follow nouns, but relative clauses precede them. Serial verb constructions are frequent, and may describe one- and two-event situations. There is no verbal inflection; the aspectual system is indicated by grammatical particles. There is also no evidential system, but both the interrogative and emphatic marker inventories include morphemes that convey epistemic information. Almost all of the Khatso are bilingual in Mandarin or the local Yunnan dialect, because that is the only way to communicate with outsiders. Chinese is also the only language used in school and mastering it is necessary to pursue an education or find employment outside the town. Children continue to learn the language, but many parents teach them Chinese first and Khatso second. Moreover, there is no writing system; the language is not supported by print media or technology. As a result, the vitality of the language is eroding rapidly. This dissertation is part of larger project to document Khatso in order to help preserve and revitalize the language.",Burma,95.955974,21.916221,1

This dissertation operates at the confluence of notions about class, gender, language, and race, especially as they revolve around public education and the hegemonic meritocratic discourse on which it is founded. This dissertation engages and contributes to scholarship within the following areas: The political economy of education; discourse and the dialectical relationship between agency and structure; cultural perspectives on identity, voice, and learning; and, Latinas/os in science education. The data that serve as the basis for the findings presented in this dissertation were collected throughout a three-phase yearlong ethnographic study of the two tracked fifth-grade classrooms at Amblen Elementary School, serving a socioeconomically disadvantaged Latina/o student population in Santa Barbara, California. In classrooms all across the nation, while it remains true that Latina/o students disproportionally take up space in the lower-tracked courses and not in the higher ones, this study does not examine inequality in tracking assignments made along ethnic/racial lines (as 100% of the students that participated in this research identify as Latina/o), rather, it investigates the consequences of what happens when Latina/o students are tracked according to symbolic markers of their ethnic/racial identity, that is, their varying levels of English language competency.

Anthropology",Anthropology,Michael A.

Differing intensities of human occupation at SCRI-195 and SCRI-496 defined harvesting pressure on M. californianus beds, and the frequency and intensity of upwelling conditions (cooler SST) influenced past productivity of M. californianus during the Late Holocene at each site location. This study reached the conclusion that the factors of site occupation dynamics and upwelling occurrence together influenced human foraging on M. californianus during the Late Holocene around Santa Cruz Island and explain variation in archaeological shellfish assemblages. This study evaluates this proposal through the study of archeological, ecological and stable isotopic data from two shell midden sites, SCRI-195 and SCRI-496, on the coast of Santa Cruz island, both occupied during the Late Holocene (2200-500 cal B.P.). The correlation between changes in abundance and size of M. californianus and past sea surface temperature (SST) through the chronological sequences at each archaeological site was statistically evaluated, regional and local SST records spanning the Late Holocene were compared, and modern data concerning ecological and oceanographic factors affecting M. californianus productivity around Santa Cruz island were used to interpret past natural conditions of this shellfish species. The results of this study show that fluctuation in regional and local past SST does not explain variation in abundance or length of collected M. californianus through the occupation of SCRI-195 and SCRI-496. Archaeologists working on the northern Channel Islands of California have proposed that during the Late Holocene, foraging decisions of the islands' prehistoric occupants were progressively less affected by environmental changes as increasing human exploitation pressure shaped abundance and size of intertidal shellfish species. This proposal, although supported by archaeological data from habitation sites, does not incorporate past small-scale ecological and oceanographic variability around the islands nor the effect of this variability on Mytilus californianus (California mussel), the main intertidal shellfish species exploited through prehistory.

Anthropology",Anthropology,Michael A. Glassow,"The Chumash living in the Santa Barbara Channel region at the time of European contact in AD 1542, and into the Early Historic period (AD 1782-1834), are described in historic documents as living a sedentary lifestyle settled in large, permanent villages. Although archaeologists working in the region today have a number of historical sources and ethnographic records to contextualize their work, little archaeological research using modern excavation and laboratory techniques has been undertaken, and much remains unknown about how the Chumash organized their households and communities and constructed economic, political, and social relationships. Results indicate that the houses were occupied by fewer individuals than was typical, although residents of the village did invest substantial labor at the sites, constructing houses and possibly a small sweat lodge. This suggests that while occupation may not have been permanent, it was significant. Residents were involved in a number of activities including the production of shell beads and ornaments, the production and maintenance of stone tools, and the collection and processing of plant and animal foods. Additionally, an analysis of the activities in which the community was engaged reveals how residents created and maintained their identity through daily practice against the backdrop of significant social, political, and economic transformation in colonial-era California. Recently, a few late prehistoric and historic sites on the Northern Channel Islands have been identified and recorded away from permanent village sites. Three of these small sites (SCRI-324, -384, -801) located in the interior of Santa Cruz Island are believed to represent the Early Historic period village of Nimatlala. These sites appear to be very different from other Early Historic period villages in that they contain smaller house depressions and shallow midden deposits. Excavation of houses and deposits at SCRI-324 and SCRI-384 was undertaken in an effort to discern the chronology of occupation, the organization of households and the community as a whole, and the nature of activities undertaken at the site.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Anthropology",Anthropology,Michael A. Glassow,"The outcome of this research includes the most complete integrated foodways research ever conducted along the central coast of California. The integration of a multiscalar chronological framework and multiple lines of subsistence data provides a unique methodological approach for investigating the role of seasonal subsistence stability in population regulation. Each line of evidence helps in unraveling a complex story of human occupation and foraging behavior at three archaeological sites that I excavated. A thorough and rigorous program of radiometric dating and Bayesian chronological models control the century-level resolution and site seasonality studies based on oxygen isotope analysis the provide seasonal resolution, necessary to infer diachronic shifts in mobility patterns. I also rely on and highlight the importance of analyzing and integrating both faunal and macrobotanical data in order to answer questions of resource exploitation and dietary sufficiency. Together these diverse lines of mobility and subsistence data allow me to reconstruct significant diachronic changes in foraging behavior and evaluate these changes with respect to evidence of climate-induced environmental change and prehistoric population growth. These results suggest that prehistoric human population growth did not always instigate major shifts in food acquisition, but rather was, in some cases, a product of subtle changes in the type, quantity, and quality of food resources upon which human foragers relied. Although this research specifically evaluates dietary and foraging behaviors on Santa Cruz Island, the broad theoretical perspective that macro-scale population level shifts among hunter-gatherers may be an unintended outcome of subtle shifts in foraging behavior---related to a variety of social, environmental, or economic variables---that inform dynamic biological processes is widely applicable to hunter-gatherer studies. Ultimately, this research sheds new light on how significant demographic shifts occurred throughout human history, prior to the adoption of domesticated foods. This archaeological dissertation research project integrates a rigorous chronological framework, geochemical data, and subsistence data to evaluate dynamic interrelationships between foodways, the environment, and human population growth in prehistory. Specifically, this case study elucidates temporal variation in risk-reducing foraging behaviors relative to a period of significant and intrinsic population growth ca. 1600 cal B.P. on the Northern Channel Islands of California. I integrate the energetic focus of reproductive ecology with a behavioral ecological perspective to provide a unique framework for understanding prehistoric demographic shifts within foraging populations.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Anthropology",Anthropology,Michael A. Glassow,"Human adaptation to the periodic infilling of Lake Cahuilla has been an important topic of discussion among researchers concerned with the archaeology of southern California's Salton Basin. In this dissertation, data from mortuary remains and associated habitation sites were used to investigate questions concerning hunter-gatherer adaptations to cyclical changes in ecological conditions in the basin. More specifically, this research explores the relationship between funerary practices and three broader issues: mobility, resource competition and social differentiation. Mortuary and settlement data contained in technical reports were compiled from 47 sites situated in the vicinity of Lake Cahuilla's ancient shoreline. The majority of the sites were located at the north end of the lake. For the settlement data, information was obtained on site structure, food remains, and types of artifacts present in middens. These data were then used to identify the type of settlement that may have been represented by cultural deposits. In terms of the mortuary data, nearly all of the mortuary features identified in the basin consisted of cremation remains. Data collected about these features included information on spatial location, physical structure of cremation facilities, and grave good associations. Skeletal data included age and sex of the deceased, total cremated bone weight, pattern of burning on bones, and bone pathologies. This information was used to define the distribution and organization of mortuary sites vis-a-vis settlement types. The results of this dissertation show that populations in the northern Salton Basin practiced both logistical and residential mobility throughout the period studied, regardless of whether a lake stand was present. Furthermore, the number of mortuary features occurring at a site was not a function of settlement type but rather of length and/or recurrence of use of a location. Examination of two formal cremation grounds demonstrated that these were established and maintained by corporate groups as a means of legitimizing use-rights of critical resources. The uniformity in burial treatment and the paucity of prestige goods accompanying the dead further indicated that these groups maintained an ethos of egalitarianism.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Anthropology",Anthropology,Juan Vicente Palerm,"California provides a unique opportunity to investigate how capitalist agriculture shapes the development of different societies. The types of agricultural workers and communities that can or are found in association with agricultural crops in California vary according to historical specificity, location and commodity produced. Production and consumption are closely linked. This linkage between consumption and production is evident in the rapid increase in the production of wine grapes across California as the consumption of wine increases globally. In the Napa Valley, the capital investment in the wine industry is changing the organization of wine grape agriculture and its relationship to labor. I investigate the role of terroir-tourism by examining the interconnection of various sectors of labor: vineyard labor, wine production, and tasting rooms. I argue that wine grape cultivation is a significant factor in shaping both physical and social spaces, society, people and landscapes in the Napa Valley. This dissertation argues that the intensified production (more labor intensive) in premium wine grapes is facilitating the permanent settlement of Mexican farm laborers in the Napa Valley. Through the use of ethnographic accounts this dissertation interrogates the meaning of social interaction in specific spaces between Mexican farm laborers and white actors. This dissertation is theoretically driven by space and examines how power, language, class, race, and knowledge interact in a social setting where the parameters are tightly scripted.

Anthropology",Anthropology,Michael A. Glassow,"Considering arguments that the unique ecological conditions that exist in maritime environments encouraged reduced residential mobility and hastened the development of socially and politically complex hunter-gatherer societies examination of the development of settlement and foraging organization can help clarify our understanding of social and cultural evolution in maritime contexts. The Northern Channel Islands of California consist of four landmasses with relatively profound environmental variation and are therefore well positioned to evaluate mobility in a maritime context. While previous mobility hypotheses have been formed for the Early Holocene (7500-10,000 BP) on the Northern Channel Islands, these hypotheses included minimal data from Santa Cruz Island, the largest and most environmentally diverse landmass within the Northern Channel Island chain. Yet, data from this island are important because the Northern Channel Islands vary in size, environment, and biodiversity. These differences can have a profound effect on foraging and mobility. This is an important issue within anthropology, as generalization of adaptive behavior does not account for local variants that can play a crucial role in cultural development. To evaluate the nature of mobility during the Early Holocene on Santa Cruz Island resource exploitation, land use, seasonality, and intensity of occupation were examined through artifactual, faunal, and floral data collected during excavations at the five known Early Holocene deposits on Santa Cruz Island. Analyses based on these data included density and diversity analyses of all material, dietary reconstruction using meat weight measures, lithic analysis using size grade ratios, archaeobotanical analysis, oxygen isotope analysis, radiocarbon dating, and various other quantitative measures that were used in both intra- and inter-sites comparisons. Interpretations of these analyses argue that subsistence and settlement decisions were based on locally available resources and the Early Holocene hunter-gatherers on Santa Cruz Island utilized a residentially mobile settlement strategy. The more complex, logistically organized settlement systems of later time periods probably had not yet developed by the end of the Early Holocene on Santa Cruz Island.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Anthropology",Anthropology,Michael A. Glassow,"The Chumash living in the Santa Barbara Channel region at the time of European contact in AD 1542, and into the Early Historic period (AD 1782-1834), are described in historic documents as living a sedentary lifestyle settled in large, permanent villages. Although archaeologists working in the region today have a number of historical sources and ethnographic records to contextualize their work, little archaeological research using modern excavation and laboratory techniques has been undertaken, and much remains unknown about how the Chumash organized their households and communities and constructed economic, political, and social relationships. Results indicate that the houses were occupied by fewer individuals than was typical, although residents of the village did invest substantial labor at the sites, constructing houses and possibly a small sweat lodge. This suggests that while occupation may not have been permanent, it was significant. Residents were involved in a number of activities including the production of shell beads and ornaments, the production and maintenance of stone tools, and the collection and processing of plant and animal foods. Additionally, an analysis of the activities in which the community was engaged reveals how residents created and maintained their identity through daily practice against the backdrop of significant social, political, and economic transformation in colonial-era California. Recently, a few late prehistoric and historic sites on the Northern Channel Islands have been identified and recorded away from permanent village sites. Three of these small sites (SCRI-324, -384, -801) located in the interior of Santa Cruz Island are believed to represent the Early Historic period village of Nimatlala. These sites appear to be very different from other Early Historic period villages in that they contain smaller house depressions and shallow midden deposits. Excavation of houses and deposits at SCRI-324 and SCRI-384 was undertaken in an effort to discern the chronology of occupation, the organization of households and the community as a whole, and the nature of activities undertaken at the site.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Anthropology",Anthropology,Michael A. Glassow,"The outcome of this research includes the most complete integrated foodways research ever conducted along the central coast of California. The integration of a multiscalar chronological framework and multiple lines of subsistence data provides a unique methodological approach for investigating the role of seasonal subsistence stability in population regulation. Each line of evidence helps in unraveling a complex story of human occupation and foraging behavior at three archaeological sites that I excavated. A thorough and rigorous program of radiometric dating and Bayesian chronological models control the century-level resolution and site seasonality studies based on oxygen isotope analysis the provide seasonal resolution, necessary to infer diachronic shifts in mobility patterns. I also rely on and highlight the importance of analyzing and integrating both faunal and macrobotanical data in order to answer questions of resource exploitation and dietary sufficiency. Together these diverse lines of mobility and subsistence data allow me to reconstruct significant diachronic changes in foraging behavior and evaluate these changes with respect to evidence of climate-induced environmental change and prehistoric population growth. These results suggest that prehistoric human population growth did not always instigate major shifts in food acquisition, but rather was, in some cases, a product of subtle changes in the type, quantity, and quality of food resources upon which human foragers relied. Although this research specifically evaluates dietary and foraging behaviors on Santa Cruz Island, the broad theoretical perspective that macro-scale population level shifts among hunter-gatherers may be an unintended outcome of subtle shifts in foraging behavior---related to a variety of social, environmental, or economic variables---that inform dynamic biological processes is widely applicable to hunter-gatherer studies. Ultimately, this research sheds new light on how significant demographic shifts occurred throughout human history, prior to the adoption of domesticated foods. This archaeological dissertation research project integrates a rigorous chronological framework, geochemical data, and subsistence data to evaluate dynamic interrelationships between foodways, the environment, and human population growth in prehistory. Specifically, this case study elucidates temporal variation in risk-reducing foraging behaviors relative to a period of significant and intrinsic population growth ca. 1600 cal B.P. on the Northern Channel Islands of California. I integrate the energetic focus of reproductive ecology with a behavioral ecological perspective to provide a unique framework for understanding prehistoric demographic shifts within foraging populations.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Anthropology",Anthropology,Michael A. Glassow,"Human adaptation to the periodic infilling of Lake Cahuilla has been an important topic of discussion among researchers concerned with the archaeology of southern California's Salton Basin. In this dissertation, data from mortuary remains and associated habitation sites were used to investigate questions concerning hunter-gatherer adaptations to cyclical changes in ecological conditions in the basin. More specifically, this research explores the relationship between funerary practices and three broader issues: mobility, resource competition and social differentiation. Mortuary and settlement data contained in technical reports were compiled from 47 sites situated in the vicinity of Lake Cahuilla's ancient shoreline. The majority of the sites were located at the north end of the lake. For the settlement data, information was obtained on site structure, food remains, and types of artifacts present in middens. These data were then used to identify the type of settlement that may have been represented by cultural deposits. In terms of the mortuary data, nearly all of the mortuary features identified in the basin consisted of cremation remains. Data collected about these features included information on spatial location, physical structure of cremation facilities, and grave good associations. Skeletal data included age and sex of the deceased, total cremated bone weight, pattern of burning on bones, and bone pathologies. This information was used to define the distribution and organization of mortuary sites vis-a-vis settlement types. The results of this dissertation show that populations in the northern Salton Basin practiced both logistical and residential mobility throughout the period studied, regardless of whether a lake stand was present. Furthermore, the number of mortuary features occurring at a site was not a function of settlement type but rather of length and/or recurrence of use of a location. Examination of two formal cremation grounds demonstrated that these were established and maintained by corporate groups as a means of legitimizing use-rights of critical resources. The uniformity in burial treatment and the paucity of prestige goods accompanying the dead further indicated that these groups maintained an ethos of egalitarianism.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Anthropology",Anthropology,Juan Vicente Palerm,"California provides a unique opportunity to investigate how capitalist agriculture shapes the development of different societies. The types of agricultural workers and communities that can or are found in association with agricultural crops in California vary according to historical specificity, location and commodity produced. Production and consumption are closely linked. This linkage between consumption and production is evident in the rapid increase in the production of wine grapes across California as the consumption of wine increases globally. In the Napa Valley, the capital investment in the wine industry is changing the organization of wine grape agriculture and its relationship to labor. I investigate the role of terroir-tourism by examining the interconnection of various sectors of labor: vineyard labor, wine production, and tasting rooms. I argue that wine grape cultivation is a significant factor in shaping both physical and social spaces, society, people and landscapes in the Napa Valley. This dissertation argues that the intensified production (more labor intensive) in premium wine grapes is facilitating the permanent settlement of Mexican farm laborers in the Napa Valley. Through the use of ethnographic accounts this dissertation interrogates the meaning of social interaction in specific spaces between Mexican farm laborers and white actors. This dissertation is theoretically driven by space and examines how power, language, class, race, and knowledge interact in a social setting where the parameters are tightly scripted.

Anthropology",Anthropology,Susan C. Stonich,"This dissertation examines food insecurity in the context of displacement and transnational migration of women from Mexico and Central America to the US. Drawing upon 18 months of ethnographic fieldwork conducted between 2008 and 2011 in the coastal region of Santa Barbara, California, I advance and contribute to several arguments. In presenting the lived experience of ""food insecurity"", I analyze the everyday forms of structural violence that shape the experience of migrant women, particularly in terms of food, health, and bodies, and I critique interventions to food insecurity and ""diet-related health problems"" implemented by state and nonprofit agencies. I argue that through their everyday struggles and interactions with groups providing assistance, migrant women navigate power differentials rooted in distinctions of race, class, gender, and legal status while also negotiating and performing new modes of citizenship. Using data from participant observation, surveys, semi-structured interviews, life history interviews, and focus groups, I seek to answer the following research questions: What is the lived experience of food insecurity among Mexican and Central American migrant women in the US, and what are the structural forces contributing to this experience? At the local level, how do nonprofit entities and public health practitioners engage in the discourse and practice of food security, particularly as it affects migrant women? And, what do the lived experience of food insecurity and interventions by state and non-state actors reveal about changing notions of rights and citizenship and about the production of class and structural violence? The answers to these questions help inform my engagement with and contribution to four primary bodies of scholarship: political economy of food and migration; political ecology of food and health; ideas of power, the state, and hegemony; and critical approaches to race, class, gender, and citizenship. In engaging with the core themes of this dissertation---food, health, and citizenship---I analyze the dialectical relationship between structural conditions and individual agency. I use the rhetoric of ""the other side"" ( el otro lado), a phrase invoked by migrant women to reference life outside of the US (specifically on the other side of the US-Mexico border), to underscore the variety of borders that limit access to livelihood resources for unauthorized migrants living in the US.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Anthropology",Anthropology,Michael A. Glassow,"Considering arguments that the unique ecological conditions that exist in maritime environments encouraged reduced residential mobility and hastened the development of socially and politically complex hunter-gatherer societies examination of the development of settlement and foraging organization can help clarify our understanding of social and cultural evolution in maritime contexts. The Northern Channel Islands of California consist of four landmasses with relatively profound environmental variation and are therefore well positioned to evaluate mobility in a maritime context. While previous mobility hypotheses have been formed for the Early Holocene (7500-10,000 BP) on the Northern Channel Islands, these hypotheses included minimal data from Santa Cruz Island, the largest and most environmentally diverse landmass within the Northern Channel Island chain. Yet, data from this island are important because the Northern Channel Islands vary in size, environment, and biodiversity. These differences can have a profound effect on foraging and mobility. This is an important issue within anthropology, as generalization of adaptive behavior does not account for local variants that can play a crucial role in cultural development. To evaluate the nature of mobility during the Early Holocene on Santa Cruz Island resource exploitation, land use, seasonality, and intensity of occupation were examined through artifactual, faunal, and floral data collected during excavations at the five known Early Holocene deposits on Santa Cruz Island. Analyses based on these data included density and diversity analyses of all material, dietary reconstruction using meat weight measures, lithic analysis using size grade ratios, archaeobotanical analysis, oxygen isotope analysis, radiocarbon dating, and various other quantitative measures that were used in both intra- and inter-sites comparisons. Interpretations of these analyses argue that subsistence and settlement decisions were based on locally available resources and the Early Holocene hunter-gatherers on Santa Cruz Island utilized a residentially mobile settlement strategy. The more complex, logistically organized settlement systems of later time periods probably had not yet developed by the end of the Early Holocene on Santa Cruz Island.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

This dissertation picks up an old academic (marxian) conversation about problem for capitalist enterprises of the ""limits of capitalist agriculture"" and reinvigorates the conversation by including a historical narrative that centers workers and their contributions towards changing the agricultural industry in Washington via consistent refusal, movement, strikes, and boycotts as well as extending the struggle over the places that Mexicans settled and against deportation and racial profiling. Madrigal uses this systematically collected data on the trends of two of the state's largest agricultural corporate enterprises, this dissertation documents that Broetje Orchards broke a United Farm Workers of Washington strike in the mid 1990s and the other, Sakuma Brothers Farm, was unable to break a strike campaign that began 2013 when Familias Unidas por la Justicia, a democratic idependent farmworker union was formed and began a campaign for a union contract. This study demonstrates that when the geography of struggle is extended over the larger capitalist market circuit of the Pacific Rim and rather than focus on a temporal moment for Mexican workers, we can see that collectively the workers have been prevailing in the long run. This runs contrary to the dominant narrative that farm workers are docile or do not want unions that represent their interests collectively against even larger multi-national enterprises that source the products of their labor from their employers. This dissertation strives to be a tool in the hands of the farmworkers who shared their life histories and experiences. In as much, it presents a map of the history and modes of production of their employers and organizes it in a manner that might be as useful for future struggles as Marcos F. Lopez UC Santa Cruz dissertation ""Places in Production: Nature, Farm Work and Farm Worker Resistance in U.S. and Mexican Strawberry Growing Regions"" (2011) on Driscoll's that narrated many of the same experiences that the farmworkers engaged in this dissertation and later provided the common ground that made relationships between Familias Unidas por la Justicia and the Allianza de Organizaciones Nacional, Estatal y Municipal por la Justicia Social a sister democrative independent farm worker union in Baja California even stronger. Even the reluctantly supportive Seth Holmes' second chapter in ""Fresh Fruit, Broken Bodies: Migrant Farmworkers in the United States"" (2013) which overlaps in documenting some of the same farmworkers that helped draft this study (FUJ member Carmen Juarez is featured on the cover of his book), helped form a campaign that helped defeat Sakuma Brothers Farm which is the subject of his and this study.

There has been little scholarly attention devoted, though, to where people with Mexican and other ethnoracial backgrounds fit within ethnoracial paradigms. Framed within historical and contemporary mestiz and multiracial identity theories, I gathered data through oral histories with Central and Northern California individuals as well as archival, oral history, and autoethnographic research on multiple generations of my Vermont family. The study contextualizes California narrators' identity formations within familial, community, and national histories to argue that, despite thorough boundary policing by monoethnically identified Mexican American and other communities, narrators inherited familial, community, cultural, sexual, and personal resources that modeled first- and multigenerational ethnoracial mixing as common and/or the integration of binaries as possible. Such models facilitated narrators' development of their own integrated mixed race, Mexican-descent identities, which they achieved by actively developing one or more of five tool patterns. The study also addresses the issue of ethnoracial identity migration, and employs an ecological approach to examine how changes in certain intersectional identity vectors (e.g., age, class, geography, and family dynamics) can lead to minor or major ethnoracial identity migrations. Furthermore, I analyze the history of ethnoracial identity over three generations of my Vermont family in terms of the models, tool patterns, and intersectional vector analyses from above, via the overarching framework of my own identity experiences. Such work ultimately requires me to redefine ""success"" and ""failure"" in my historical inquiry, moving from ""fact"" to antiracist, feminist intervention in my family's ethnoracial memory. The comparative nature of the study is distinctive. First, most studies about the multiracial Mexican-descent community thus far have each looked at one ethnoracial heritage combination (e.g. Mexipino, Punjabi Mexican American, White/Mexican), whereas this study attends to multiple ""Mexican-and"" backgrounds. This provides important insight into how particular inter-community histories influence the articulation of Mexican American and multiracial identities. Second, I redefine ""Mexican American""/""Chican "" as contemporarily (first-, second-, or third+-generation), rather than only historically, mixed. At the same time, however, I position multigenerational inheritance as central to the ethnoracial self-making of people with contemporarily mixed backgrounds.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

As part of the Chicana/o Radical Performance Tradition, the performances of CSS imagined and created a culture of liberation and emancipation through Chicana/o political satire. The sketch comedy troupe's response to the neoliberal racial capitalist moment of the late 1980s to the present articulated what I describe as ""Oppositional Performance."" This dissertation argues that instances of opposition performance emanate from within the contested historical context between the dominant neoliberal bloc and the emergent Chicana/o art performance bloc. Utilizing the interdisciplinary research methods of Chicana/o Cultural Studies and incorporating performance studies, media studies, history, and sociology, this dissertation interrogates the socio-historical significance of Chicano Secret Service and Chicana/o cultural production. This dissertation also serves as a CSS archive. Interviews were conducted with all the members of CSS: Elias Serna, Susan Carrasco, Eduardo Lopez. As a scholar/activist/ and member of CSS I have utilized an observant participant method to conduct a critical oral history of CSS. I also conducted interviews with people that played a large role in assisting CSS to become an avant-garde comedy troupe, such as Luis Valdez, Rene Yanez, Tiffany Ann Lopez, Kinan Valdez, Laura Perez and Diane Gamboa. I also collected and analyzed CSS films and performance videos, along with a collection of newspaper articles, unpublished scripts, posters, performance programs and original story boards. My cultural-historical analysis links the practices of CSS to the Chicana/o power movement renaissance art movement and to the Chicana/o avant-garde. Grounded in this Chicana/o Radical Performance Tradition, CSS expresses the collective response of the Chicana/o working classes in Southern California in a neoliberal historical context. I analyze four landmark actos/sketches and three multimedia performances to demonstrate how Chicana/o expressive cultures can subvert hegemony in ephemeral yet unpredictably enduring terms. The oppositional performances produced by CSS resonate within the Chicana/o Radical Performance Tradition that simultaneously critiques cultural domination and turns hegemony on its head. Drawing on oppositional performances and the Chicana/o Radical Performance Tradition as a framework, I argue that Chicano Secret Service's work exhibits the tenets expressed within the Radical Chicana/o Tradition in a more general manner. Although such performances illuminate the life world of the individuals within CSS, the collaborative relations between different bodies, memories, and communities within enacted performance spaces intertwine to produce a collective Chicana/o performance and social power. This dissertation argues that such performances are mestizo rhetorics, new inventions of Western and indigenous cultures that create forms of Chicana/o knowledge.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

The purpose of this study is to investigate how listening to music, through its affective (both specific sentiments and a general sense of what a space or time feels like) and sonic energies, generates modes of thinking and feeling that shape identity, community and resilience. While Latino music cultures have long been celebrated listening and listening practices as a form of knowing, being and surviving is understudied. I focus on three groups of listeners that, I argue, represent Latino listening cultures--- a culturally specific set of shared attitudes, values and practices around listening to particular music. The listening cultures analyzed included Mexican custodians who listen to the radio at work, Chicana/o Morrissey fans, and undergraduate Latina/o iPod users. Methodologically, my research is grounded in ethnographic methods of participant-observation, interviews, surveys, and material collection. A total of 40 semi-structured interviews were carried out with Chicano/Latino music lovers and 275 students responded to a web survey. A grounded theory approach was used to code all data. Additionally, I recorded field observations at concerts, work spaces, and campus common areas. Findings suggest that practices, associations and feelings generated through listening to music are a significant site for critical awareness of ethnic and gender identity, racialization, and community. Ultimately, I argue listening may generate resilient forms of listening and living. One major finding from the Chicana/o listening culture built around Morrissey was that at an individual level, Morrissey provides a venue for fans to explore emotional losses and vulnerabilities, as well as, nontraditional gender roles and identities. At the collective level, listeners discussed finding solace over feeling excluded from the wider society because of racial and cultural differences. The Mexican custodians found, in Spanish-language radio, a late-night companion for their solitary job, an affirming connection to Mexico and a way to literally claim space through music. A survey of 275 undergraduate Latinos revealed that listening to music on digital music players functioned as a sonic refuge for coping with stress, a minoritized status on campus, as well as a portable sonic archive of ethnic identity.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

It considers this historical moment as the ""banishment"" of U.S. citizens of Mexican descent to foreground the difference between repatriation, which implies that the person is not a citizen of a given country and banishment, referring to citizens who are banned from their home country. This discursive difference challenges much of the literature that refers to these banishments as ""repatriations"", obscuring the systematic racist and exclusionist immigration policies. The legal, social, and cultural ramifications of banishment on second and third generation descendants of U.S. citizens are largely absent in Chicana/o-Latina/o historiographies and immigration legal studies. My work takes an innovative approach in that it focuses on the prolonged consequences of immigration policies on surviving banished U.S. citizens and their descendants and the link to today's growing legally mixed-status households across the United States. My study demonstrates that U.S. immigration policies continue to ignore the long and complex Mexico-U.S. immigration relations, failing to create adequate paths to legalization for old and new generations of Mexican immigrants. This study centers on the experiences of banishment of three extended families and uses their oral histories across multiple generations to recover and rewrite the history of forced exclusion. The families are composed of surviving U.S. citizens who were banished during the early twentieth century and/or who are descendants of those survivors who have returned to the United States, some as undocumented immigrants. The participating families include the Yanez family, residing in Anaheim, California; the Molina family, spread throughout California, Alabama, and Mexico; and the Robles family, living in Pasadena, California. To allow for personal accounts as well as communal- or family-based interpretations, each family member is interviewed individually and then the entire family is interviewed collectively, providing for a multiplicity of insights and richly texture points of views. In addition to oral histories, this study mines the families' archives, which are composed of photographs, letters, and legal records detailing the experiences of banishment over the course of the twentieth century. Institutional records, including legal histories, archival materials, and demographic data housed at the National Archives in Washington D.C. and the regional branches in Los Angeles, California, as well as El Paso, Texas are used to contextualize the primary research and to reconstruct and reinterpret the immigration policies of the time. My study indicates that these families experienced repatriation in very unique ways, but with a common sense of contempt that extends across family generations, and continue to face real legal and social collateral consequences. My findings demonstrate that an almost 90-year-old unofficial, later becoming official, policy continues to classify direct descendents of banished U.S. citizens as ""illegal"" immigrants in their parents and grandparents' home country. Banishment has resulted in what I term, a transgenerational illegality, which has been nearly impossible to shake. These findings are crucial at a time where immigration remains central to national debates.

Such models facilitated narrators' development of their own integrated mixed race, Mexican-descent identities, which they achieved by actively developing one or more of five tool patterns. The study also addresses the issue of ethnoracial identity migration, and employs an ecological approach to examine how changes in certain intersectional identity vectors (e.g., age, class, geography, and family dynamics) can lead to minor or major ethnoracial identity migrations.

While Latino music cultures have long been celebrated listening and listening practices as a form of knowing, being and surviving is understudied. I focus on three groups of listeners that, I argue, represent Latino listening cultures--- a culturally specific set of shared attitudes, values and practices around listening to particular music. The listening cultures analyzed included Mexican custodians who listen to the radio at work, Chicana/o Morrissey fans, and undergraduate Latina/o iPod users. Methodologically, my research is grounded in ethnographic methods of participant-observation, interviews, surveys, and material collection. A total of 40 semi-structured interviews were carried out with Chicano/Latino music lovers and 275 students responded to a web survey. A grounded theory approach was used to code all data. Additionally, I recorded field observations at concerts, work spaces, and campus common areas. Findings suggest that practices, associations and feelings generated through listening to music are a significant site for critical awareness of ethnic and gender identity, racialization, and community. Ultimately, I argue listening may generate resilient forms of listening and living. One major finding from the Chicana/o listening culture built around Morrissey was that at an individual level, Morrissey provides a venue for fans to explore emotional losses and vulnerabilities, as well as, nontraditional gender roles and identities. At the collective level, listeners discussed finding solace over feeling excluded from the wider society because of racial and cultural differences. The Mexican custodians found, in Spanish-language radio, a late-night companion for their solitary job, an affirming connection to Mexico and a way to literally claim space through music. A survey of 275 undergraduate Latinos revealed that listening to music on digital music players functioned as a sonic refuge for coping with stress, a minoritized status on campus, as well as a portable sonic archive of ethnic identity.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Chicana and Chicano studies",Chicana and Chicano studies,"Juan V. Palerm, Aida Hurtado","Picking up on the Mexican experience in the Pacific Northwest at the end of the Bracero program which has been narrated by Erasmo Gamboa (2000) and more recently by Mario Jimenez Sifuentez (2016), Madrigal uses oral history interviews, ethnography, family history, archival and government data to narrate the experience of Mexican farmworkers in Washington State from 1964 to 2013. This dissertation picks up an old academic (marxian) conversation about problem for capitalist enterprises of the ""limits of capitalist agriculture"" and reinvigorates the conversation by including a historical narrative that centers workers and their contributions towards changing the agricultural industry in Washington via consistent refusal, movement, strikes, and boycotts as well as extending the struggle over the places that Mexicans settled and against deportation and racial profiling. Madrigal uses this systematically collected data on the trends of two of the state's largest agricultural corporate enterprises, this dissertation documents that Broetje Orchards broke a United Farm Workers of Washington strike in the mid 1990s and the other, Sakuma Brothers Farm, was unable to break a strike campaign that began 2013 when Familias Unidas por la Justicia, a democratic idependent farmworker union was formed and began a campaign for a union contract. This study demonstrates that when the geography of struggle is extended over the larger capitalist market circuit of the Pacific Rim and rather than focus on a temporal moment for Mexican workers, we can see that collectively the workers have been prevailing in the long run. This runs contrary to the dominant narrative that farm workers are docile or do not want unions that represent their interests collectively against even larger multi-national enterprises that source the products of their labor from their employers. This dissertation strives to be a tool in the hands of the farmworkers who shared their life histories and experiences. In as much, it presents a map of the history and modes of production of their employers and organizes it in a manner that might be as useful for future struggles as Marcos F. Lopez UC Santa Cruz dissertation ""Places in Production: Nature, Farm Work and Farm Worker Resistance in U.S. and Mexican Strawberry Growing Regions"" (2011) on Driscoll's that narrated many of the same experiences that the farmworkers engaged in this dissertation and later provided the common ground that made relationships between Familias Unidas por la Justicia and the Allianza de Organizaciones Nacional, Estatal y Municipal por la Justicia Social a sister democrative independent farm worker union in Baja California even stronger. Even the reluctantly supportive Seth Holmes' second chapter in ""Fresh Fruit, Broken Bodies: Migrant Farmworkers in the United States"" (2013) which overlaps in documenting some of the same farmworkers that helped draft this study (FUJ member Carmen Juarez is featured on the cover of his book), helped form a campaign that helped defeat Sakuma Brothers Farm which is the subject of his and this study. It is for this reason that the growers and multi-national enterprises that source from them are named as it makes the matter of cross referencing in the future easier for union researchers.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Chicana and Chicano Studies",Chicana and Chicano Studies,"Mario T. Garcia, George Lipsitz","This dissertation documents, describes, and analyzes the emergence and elaboration of cultural expressions produced by the comedy troupe Chicano Secret Service (CSS) from 1988 to the present. As part of the Chicana/o Radical Performance Tradition, the performances of CSS imagined and created a culture of liberation and emancipation through Chicana/o political satire. The sketch comedy troupe's response to the neoliberal racial capitalist moment of the late 1980s to the present articulated what I describe as ""Oppositional Performance."" This dissertation argues that instances of opposition performance emanate from within the contested historical context between the dominant neoliberal bloc and the emergent Chicana/o art performance bloc. Utilizing the interdisciplinary research methods of Chicana/o Cultural Studies and incorporating performance studies, media studies, history, and sociology, this dissertation interrogates the socio-historical significance of Chicano Secret Service and Chicana/o cultural production. This dissertation also serves as a CSS archive. Interviews were conducted with all the members of CSS: Elias Serna, Susan Carrasco, Eduardo Lopez. As a scholar/activist/ and member of CSS I have utilized an observant participant method to conduct a critical oral history of CSS. I also conducted interviews with people that played a large role in assisting CSS to become an avant-garde comedy troupe, such as Luis Valdez, Rene Yanez, Tiffany Ann Lopez, Kinan Valdez, Laura Perez and Diane Gamboa. I also collected and analyzed CSS films and performance videos, along with a collection of newspaper articles, unpublished scripts, posters, performance programs and original story boards. My cultural-historical analysis links the practices of CSS to the Chicana/o power movement renaissance art movement and to the Chicana/o avant-garde. Grounded in this Chicana/o Radical Performance Tradition, CSS expresses the collective response of the Chicana/o working classes in Southern California in a neoliberal historical context. I analyze four landmark actos/sketches and three multimedia performances to demonstrate how Chicana/o expressive cultures can subvert hegemony in ephemeral yet unpredictably enduring terms. The oppositional performances produced by CSS resonate within the Chicana/o Radical Performance Tradition that simultaneously critiques cultural domination and turns hegemony on its head. Drawing on oppositional performances and the Chicana/o Radical Performance Tradition as a framework, I argue that Chicano Secret Service's work exhibits the tenets expressed within the Radical Chicana/o Tradition in a more general manner. Although such performances illuminate the life world of the individuals within CSS, the collaborative relations between different bodies, memories, and communities within enacted performance spaces intertwine to produce a collective Chicana/o performance and social power. This dissertation argues that such performances are mestizo rhetorics, new inventions of Western and indigenous cultures that create forms of Chicana/o knowledge.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

It argues that contemporary regimes of control as well as forms of effective political intervention converge at the intersection of these fields. The critical framework it develops, biotechnical ecologies, is equipped to examine urban intervention through collective art practices and their speculative digital futures as well as contemporary forms of regulation and limitation at work in the urban landscape. Following an ethnographic methodology, the work is based on extensive research on organizations, artists and activists in Los Angeles and Buenos Aires. Complementing this empirical and site-based research, biotechnical ecologies also proposes alternative imaginings of these two cities and the works it explores within them while attending to their historical and material specificities. The urban media projects engaged include PigeonBlog, a participatory laymen science project designed by Beatriz da Costa that used carrier pigeons to monitor pollution in Southern California; BuenosAiresWord, an interactive web site that allows users to send and receive messages made of letters taken from images of text throughout the city; Buenos Aires Libre, a horizontally-organized group of programmers and computer enthusiasts who are building an autonomous network, apart from the internet, in Buenos Aires; and Machine Project, an arts and media collective and gallery space in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Computer Science",Computer Science,Ben Y. Zhao,"In this dissertation, we tackle three important graph research problems caused by the significant differences of the big real graphs: efficient node distance computation, graph dynamic analysis and modeling, and graph privacy. First, we target on a fundamental graph analysis problem, i.e. node distance computation. As a primitive of graph analysis and network applications, the computation of shortest path or random walk distances is computationally expensive, and difficult to scale with the sheer size of big real graphs. To address the scalability issue, we design a novel node distance computation method, named graph coordinate systems, to efficiently estimate node distances with high accuracy. Finally, to address privacy issue in sharing graphs, we design a graph privacy system to guarantee the required level of privacy. The goal of our work is to design a system that can both maintain a meaningful graph structure and provide strong privacy guarantee. To navigate the tradeoff between the strength of privacy and graph structure utility, we propose a differentially-private graph model. Our rigorous proof shows that the graphs produced by the system can achieve the required level of privacy. By running the system on real graphs collected from Facebook, Internet, and Web, the results demonstrate that the generated synthetic graphs match the original graphs in terms of graph structural metrics and application-level performance. As fundamental abstractions of network structures, graphs are everywhere, ranging from biological protein interaction networks and Internet routing networks, to emerging online social networks. Studying graphs is critical to understanding the fundamental processes behind the networks, and of practical importance in experimental research. Although many studies on graphs have been carried out in decades, most of the work focused on small or synthetic graphs. In recent years, because of the unprecedented increase of existing networks and the emergence of new complex networks, more and more big real graphs are becoming available. Compared to the graphs studied in prior work, the graphs from these networks are significantly different in scale, level of dynamics and structure. Our second work is to understand and model the dynamic processes in big real graphs. Specifically, we propose methods to analyze graph dynamics at multiple network scales and explore temporal properties of network growth. Through measurements on Renren first two-year dynamic data, we find independent and predictable processes at different network levels, and detect self-similar properties in its edge creation process. Based on the observations, we propose a new dynamic graph model to capture both temporal and spatial properties. Calibrated with the Renren dataset, our model successfully produces synthetic graphs showing similar dynamic properties. In summary, to analyze and process the graphs from today's large complex networks, we work on three important problems, including efficiently computing node distances in massive graphs, analyzing and modeling high volume of dynamics in big real graphs, and protecting graph privacy in sharing graphs. We propose novel solutions to address these problems. Through our extensive experiments, we show that our designs perform consistently well on big real graphs.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Earth Science",Earth Science,David L. Valentine,"Samples containing low and medium natural gas concentrations were collected from the world's largest natural marine seep field, Coal Oil Point, located offshore of Santa Barbara, California. Natural gas emanating from Coal Oil Point first diffuses into sediment porewater before migrating into the overlying water column to form a dissolved plume. Novel radioactive tracers were developed and applied to assess the timing by which microbes metabolize these gases within both the water column and sediment. A three phase study was employed to track the dissolved hydrocarbon plume within the water column. Phase 1 synthesized tritiated ethane, propane, and butane using Grignard reagents and tritiated water; Phase 2 systematically assessed the experimental conditions, wherein the indigenous microbial community was found to rapidly oxidize ethane, propane, and butane; Phase 3 applied radioactive tracers to track microbial oxidation within a dissolved hydrocarbon plume. Spatial and temporal patterns of ethane, propane, and butane oxidation down current from the hydrocarbon seeps demonstrated that >99% of these gases were metabolized within 1.3 days following initial exposure. Estimates based on the observed metabolic rates and carbon mass balance calculations suggest that ethane-, propane-, and butane-consuming microorganisms may transiently account for a majority of the total microbial community within impacted waters. Samples containing high natural gas concentrations were collected from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, both during and following the nearly three-month hydrocarbon release. Microbial oxidation of ethane and propane was tracked using stable isotope (13C) tracers. Within 20 weeks of the onset of hydrocarbon release, the microbial communities had ""bloomed"" to consume elevated concentrations of ethane and propane, and subsequently ""busted"" following a prolonged period of starvation. This short time interval for complete natural gas consumption contradicts initial predictions based on previous methane studies, and indicates that oxidation rates can accelerate in environments of high hydrocarbon concentrations. Sediment studies focused on the metabolism of ethane oxidation from two individual seeps within the Coal Oil Point field: Campus Point Mounds and Patch Seep. Ethane oxidation was quantified in slurry incubations under anaerobic conditions, which indicated that >97% of the gas was removed after 43 days when incubated near in situ temperature and gas concentrations. This study was the first to quantify anaerobic ethane oxidation within cold seep sediments. Total ethane consumption rates from Campus Point Mounds and Patch Seep were calculated to be 2 microM day-1 and 0.012 microM day-1, respectively, revealing that anaerobic oxidation in sediment is a dynamic process capable of modulating ethane's release into the ocean and atmosphere. Ethane oxidation was also quantified in whole core profiles. These profiles showed elevated ethane oxidation rates to depths of 11 cm beneath the sea floor, but rates below detection in the underlying zone of low sulfate. Natural gases have many environmental consequences if released into the atmosphere due to their high global warming potentials. However, these gases are subject to oxidation by microorganisms, which act as an effective biofilter that limits the atmospheric input. Organisms responsible for this oxidation are present in a wide range of environments and hydrocarbon compositions. To quantify the rate at which a microbial community oxidizes and regulates the flux of hydrocarbons into an environment, a combination of chemical tracer techniques is typically applied. This work applied both stable and radioactive tracers to monitor the oxidation capacity of the microbial community in both water column and marine sediment, with hydrocarbon concentrations generally ranging from low (coastal systems near hydrocarbon reservoirs) to medium (natural seeps) to high (oil spills).",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Epsilon Hf(i) values from zircon in seven ultrapotassic rocks yield consistent results both within and between samples, with a weighted mean of 1.9 +/- 0.2 (MSWD = 0.9), indicating derivation from a shared, isotopically homogeneous source. In contrast, exploratory in-situ Nd isotopic data from titanite in the ultrapotassic rocks are variable (epsilonNd (i) = -3.5 to -12), suggesting secondary alteration and/or contamination from an isotopically enriched source in some samples. The most primitive epsilonNd (i) isotopic signatures do, however, overlap epsilonNd(i) from monazite (epsilonNd(i) = -2.8 +/- 0.2) and bastnasite (epsilonNd(i) = -3.2 +/- 0.3) in the carbonatite, indicating derivation from a source with the same Nd isotopic signature. The petrogenesis of the rare earth element-bearing carbonatite at Mountain Pass, California remains poorly understood despite the deposit's discovery in the 1950s. Ore-bearing carbonatite dikes and a stock are spatially associated with a suite of ultrapotassic igneous rocks, and, based on geochemical data, the two have been proposed to be genetically related. Such petrologic models are complicated by existing geochronologic constraints indicating that the carbonatite is _15-25 m.y. younger than the ultrapotassic rocks, leading some authors to favor formation of the ore-bearing carbonatite during a separate, younger event and/or via a different mechanism. New laser ablation split-stream inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LASS-ICPMS) petrochronologic data from 19 ultrapotassic intrusive rocks from Mountain Pass yield titanite and zircon U-Pb ages from 1429 +/- 10 to 1385 +/- 18 Ma, expanding the U-Pb age range of ultrapotassic rocks in the complex by _20 m.y. Although carbonatite is the youngest rock type in the intrusive complex based on cross-cutting relationships, at the resolution of the LA-MC-ICPMS technique, Th-Pb monazite ages of carbonatite are not resolvable from titanite and zircon ages in ultrapotassic rocks, eliminating the previously inferred time gap between ultrapotassic and carbonatite magmatism at Mountain Pass. These new geochronologic data combined with whole rock elemental and mineral-scale isotope data imply that the ultrapotassic -- carbonatite rocks at Mountain Pass are part of a genetically-related suite that formed via extreme fractional crystallization and/or silicate-carbonatite liquid immiscibility processes.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Earth Science",Earth Science,David L. Valentine,"Samples containing low and medium natural gas concentrations were collected from the world's largest natural marine seep field, Coal Oil Point, located offshore of Santa Barbara, California. Natural gas emanating from Coal Oil Point first diffuses into sediment porewater before migrating into the overlying water column to form a dissolved plume. Novel radioactive tracers were developed and applied to assess the timing by which microbes metabolize these gases within both the water column and sediment. A three phase study was employed to track the dissolved hydrocarbon plume within the water column. Phase 1 synthesized tritiated ethane, propane, and butane using Grignard reagents and tritiated water; Phase 2 systematically assessed the experimental conditions, wherein the indigenous microbial community was found to rapidly oxidize ethane, propane, and butane; Phase 3 applied radioactive tracers to track microbial oxidation within a dissolved hydrocarbon plume. Spatial and temporal patterns of ethane, propane, and butane oxidation down current from the hydrocarbon seeps demonstrated that >99% of these gases were metabolized within 1.3 days following initial exposure. Estimates based on the observed metabolic rates and carbon mass balance calculations suggest that ethane-, propane-, and butane-consuming microorganisms may transiently account for a majority of the total microbial community within impacted waters. Samples containing high natural gas concentrations were collected from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, both during and following the nearly three-month hydrocarbon release. Microbial oxidation of ethane and propane was tracked using stable isotope (13C) tracers. Within 20 weeks of the onset of hydrocarbon release, the microbial communities had ""bloomed"" to consume elevated concentrations of ethane and propane, and subsequently ""busted"" following a prolonged period of starvation. This short time interval for complete natural gas consumption contradicts initial predictions based on previous methane studies, and indicates that oxidation rates can accelerate in environments of high hydrocarbon concentrations. Sediment studies focused on the metabolism of ethane oxidation from two individual seeps within the Coal Oil Point field: Campus Point Mounds and Patch Seep. Ethane oxidation was quantified in slurry incubations under anaerobic conditions, which indicated that >97% of the gas was removed after 43 days when incubated near in situ temperature and gas concentrations. This study was the first to quantify anaerobic ethane oxidation within cold seep sediments. Total ethane consumption rates from Campus Point Mounds and Patch Seep were calculated to be 2 microM day-1 and 0.012 microM day-1, respectively, revealing that anaerobic oxidation in sediment is a dynamic process capable of modulating ethane's release into the ocean and atmosphere. Ethane oxidation was also quantified in whole core profiles. These profiles showed elevated ethane oxidation rates to depths of 11 cm beneath the sea floor, but rates below detection in the underlying zone of low sulfate. Natural gases have many environmental consequences if released into the atmosphere due to their high global warming potentials. However, these gases are subject to oxidation by microorganisms, which act as an effective biofilter that limits the atmospheric input. Organisms responsible for this oxidation are present in a wide range of environments and hydrocarbon compositions. To quantify the rate at which a microbial community oxidizes and regulates the flux of hydrocarbons into an environment, a combination of chemical tracer techniques is typically applied. This work applied both stable and radioactive tracers to monitor the oxidation capacity of the microbial community in both water column and marine sediment, with hydrocarbon concentrations generally ranging from low (coastal systems near hydrocarbon reservoirs) to medium (natural seeps) to high (oil spills).",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology","Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology",Cheryl J. Briggs,"Mountain yellow-legged frogs (Rana muscosa and Rana sierrae) of California's Sierra Nevada have been extirpated from over 90% of their historic range, initially by introduced trout predators, and more recently by the emergence of the lethal amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis). Formerly widespread and abundant, mountain yellow-legged frogs are grazers and highly connected high level predators, living in low diversity, low productivity high elevation lakes. Here, I examine the extent to which frog extinctions impact Sierra Nevada lake communities. First, in a study that combined surveys of benthic macroinvertebrates in 22 lakes over 5 years with a reanalysis of benthic macroinvertebrate community data from over 150 lakes, I found no strong differences in benthic macroinvertebrate community diversity or composition between lakes with frogs vs. lakes without frogs. I also conducted experiments to evaluate the impact of tadpoles as grazers on benthic algae, and found that tadpoles do reduce algal biomass in artificial habitats, but that the effect can be small and may not outweigh the influence that abiotic variability has on algal biomass in lakes. Lastly, while I documented that large and periodic tadpole aggregations create biogeochemical hotspots of dissolved nitrogen, the phenomena may not be widespread enough to drive differences in diatom diversity in lakes with vs. without tadpoles. Within lakes, I found little indication that diatom community diversity and composition were responding to tadpole generated nitrogen hotspots as a fluctuation-dependent mechanism with potential to enhance diatom coexistence. While none of the ecological effects of mountain yellow-legged frogs and tadpoles that I observed suggests that their extinctions are having large impacts on Sierra Nevada lake communities, they should not be discounted as expendable, because there are many other ways in which these amphibians could be important in their communities.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology","Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology",Gretchen E. Hofmann,"Anthropogenic carbon emissions are predicted to alter marine ecosystems. One such change is the decline in ocean pH, known as ocean acidification. Model predictions of ocean acidification have guided biological experiments for more than a decade. Many studies predict negative consequences of future ocean pH on marine species. To understand how species will respond to future conditions, however, knowledge of present-day pH exposures is necessary and often limited. In this dissertation, I described present-day pH variability in three coastal regions and used the data to design laboratory experiments assessing the physiological response of two organisms, sea urchins and mussels, to changing ocean conditions. As recorded by autonomous pH sensors, I found three unique patterns of coastal pH variability. Near-shore Antarctica was characterized by a steep seasonal increase in pH and pH variability during summer phytoplankton blooms. The northern Channel Islands, California, exhibited event-scale and diurnal pH variability due to primary production of phytoplankton and fixed vegetation. Only mild effects from upwelling were detected at the islands, suggesting that this region may become a spatial refuge from extreme low pH in the future. Finally, Oregon was characterized by event-scale decreases in pH due to periodic upwelling events. The results from this research show that many coastal species experience short-term changes in pH that are within the same magnitude of change predicted for ocean acidification by the end of the century. While such present-day exposures to pH variability may promote tolerance of future pH change, these near-shore regions are also characterized by unique patterns of thermal stress. I conducted two studies to investigate the interactive effects of pH and temperature on organismal physiology. First, Antarctic sea urchin, Sterechinus neumayeri, early developmental stages (EDSs) currently experience < 2 C seasonal warming and may only experience a few degrees of ocean warming over the next 100 years. Despite development under pH and temperatures outside of current exposures, S. neumayeri EDSs exhibited high tolerance of a one-hour heat stress test, suggesting this species may be more resilient to ocean change than previously thought. Second, unlike Antarctic species, intertidal species at mid-latitudes experience daily temperature fluctuations that can exceed four times end-century predictions of ocean warming, due to tidal cycles. In Oregon, upwelling events enhance this temperature range by periodically delivering cold, low pH water to the intertidal zone. Depending on sea water conditions simulating an upwelling event (cold, low pH) or wind relaxation (warm, high pH), the intertidal mussel Mytilus californianus generated different transcriptomic signatures of the cellular heat shock response, following exposure to aerial heat stress. This suggests that future changes in seawater conditions may alter the heat stress tolerance of M. californianus during low tides. The results from this dissertation highlight the importance of designing experiments that reflect species' present-day and future multi-stressor environment, in order to generate ecologically relevant conclusions. As anthropogenic stressors continue to take hold of coastal seas, understanding the biological consequences is critical for management and conservation efforts.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology","Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology","Steven D. Gaines, Robert R. Warner","Body size has long been recognized as a key driver of species interactions and of an individual's role in the ecosystem. Body size determines the amount, species, and sizes of prey resources an individual can consume, as well as its own susceptibility to predators. Human harvest of predators can result in severe truncations in predator body size that can have cascading consequences on food webs. Where small and large individuals of the same species differ greatly in their diets, as is common in aquatic systems, the absence of large predators may functionally eliminate a key predator-prey linkage. Recently management agencies have begun to include size-based metrics as targets. As various harvest strategies differentially affect predator size and biomass, the research presented in this dissertation aims to understand the conditions under which truncations in predator size structure will result in additional loss of predator function than would be predicted from predator biomass alone, and where it will therefore be important to maintain predator size distributions. I specifically examine how the type of ontogenetic shift in diet (e.g. prey species or size class), and the shape of the diet switching function (e.g. gradual or abrupt) will affect the consequences of the loss of the largest predators, and the relative utility of various management strategies in maintaining predator function. In Chapter 1, I examined the tradeoffs between fishery yield and predator function in the ecosystem when preferentially fishing the largest predators. I found that fisheries that delay harvest until large predator sizes maximize fishery yield but that this virtually eliminates predation on focal prey eaten late in life history when diet shifts are abrupt and occur at or after the size at maturity. In this case, there is a clear tradeoff between fisheries and ecosystem objectives. Instead, where shifts in diet toward late prey are more gradual, targeting the largest predators can achieve a win-win by maximizing yield and achieving predation rates similar to that with other strategies that harvest predators earlier. As such, the optimal fishing strategy to achieve both single-species and ecosystem benefits depends strongly on the interaction between the fishery selectivity pattern and the changes in predator diet with size. In Chapter 2, I quantified the size-dependence of the predator-prey interaction between herbivorous sea urchins and one of their important predators in southern California kelp forests, California Sheephead. I further examined the consequences of changes in sheephead size and abundance in marine reserves at Catalina Island on size-specific urchin mortality in field predation trials. In my observations of predation of sheephead on urchins, sheephead smaller than 20cm TL do not eat urchins of any size. Thereafter, small sheephead only consumed small urchins, with larger sheephead sizes needed to successfully consume larger urchins, and the largest sheephead preferentially targeted the largest urchins. Inside marine reserves at Catalina, the greater abundance of large sheephead in combination with the observed size-specific capacities for urchin predation led to higher urchin mortality with marine reserve protection, particularly for the largest urchins. Ultimately, by restoring predator size structure, reserves may serve to enhance the resilience of southern California kelp forests. In Chapter 3, I examined how variation in predator body size distributions and biomass affects the likelihood of size escapes in situations where predators begin eating prey at some threshold size and thereafter consume increasingly larger prey. We focus on California sheephead because of the size dependence of its interaction with herbivorous sea urchins (Chapter 2), and the natural variation in demography where sheephead achieve smaller maximum sizes but higher biomass in the south of its range. We evaluate the consequences of smaller predator body size on top-down control of urchin populations in two scenarios: 1) when overall predator abundance is the same as the population with larger body size, and 2) when predator biomass is the same. With the same numbers of predators, top-down control was significantly weakened by the lack of large sheephead. However, when sheephead biomass was maintained, the absence of large sheephead did not lead to greater urchin abundance, despite lower predation rates overall and much lower predation on large urchins. Higher predation rates on the smallest urchin size classes served as a bottleneck that kept total urchin population at similar levels and prevented a size escape for the largest urchins. This suggests that where predators switch prey size classes in the same species, the loss of the largest individuals does not inherently result in weaker top-down control, if biomass is maintained, but effective control is sensitive to prey growth rates. The results of this research suggest that the ignoring shifts in predator size structure can under-estimate the effects of fishing on predator function, especially when large predators eat different species than their smaller counterparts. High predator biomass can compensate when diet shifts are to different prey size classes of the same species. Concordance between diet shifts and fishery selectivity can help identify where it will be important to consider changes in predator size in addition to biomass.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Currently, 90% of grasslands within California are dominated by exotic species, most notably exotic annual grasses from Europe. The research conducted here evaluates the effects of the widespread exotic annual grass, Bromus diandrus, and its thatch (i.e. dead persistent litter) on the physical and community structure in a central California grassland. The controls over Bromus diandrus persistence and spread in grasslands were also evaluated. Observational comparisons between native and exotic-dominated grassland patches were used to determine that exotic-dominated patches had more thatch and 3x less light at the soil surface than neighboring native patches. There were fewer species associated with exotic-dominated patches and species traits, such as timing of growth, seed size and plant height, were important in determining the distribution of species in the two patch types. Thatch and Bromus diandrus density were manipulated to evaluate the underlying mechanisms leading to native forb decline in grasslands invaded by Bromus diandrus. Thatch inhibited the performance of native forbs, while competition from living Bromus diandrus had little effect. There was also a positive Bromus diandrus-thatch feedback, whereby Bromus diandrus performed best with moderate amounts of thatch. The positive Bromus diandrus-thatch feedback may be one important factor contributing to the rise to dominance and persistence of this species in many grasslands. Given the negative effects of Bromus diandrus and its thatch on native species performance, I sought to understand the controls over its spread under predicted global change conditions. Bromus diandrus spread was facilitated by N enrichment and constrained by prolonged drought periods achieved through repatterned rainfall treatments. The invasion of the exotic annual grass, Bromus diandrus, into the grasslands of California has altered important plant resources, like light, and lead to the decline of many native forb species. Largely these biological impacts are mediated through the production of thatch, rather than living Bromus diandrus, indicating that management actions focusing on thatch removal will be the most promising for reducing the impact of this species.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

In light of this there is a need to better understand the influences of trees on the herbaceous community. In particular, the potential for trees to exert long-term impacts on communities following their death and the role of spatial factors such canopy size or isolation in determining species diversity have rarely been evaluated in a single system. I used observational and experimental approaches to explore the overarching question: how do isolated Quercus in California grasslands affect the surrounding community? I specifically tested whether co-occurring deciduous and evergreen oaks influence understory composition differently and how this influence varies along a latitudinal gradient in California using an extensive survey. Because canopy oaks die often or have been actively removed I also evaluated the longevity of tree impact by surveying dead individuals. Using this survey data I examined how spatial heterogeneity in resources created by savanna trees as well as their relative arrangement within the grassland matrix contributes to landscape patterns of species richness. Lastly, I performed an experiment manipulating the mechanisms by which trees might create gradients in vegetation, focusing on the response of two species of native perennial grass that are potential restoration targets. I found a regionally consistent influence of oaks on understory species composition; all oaks were associated with increased abundance of non-native annual grasses. This pattern continued long after the death of the tree. Community composition outside the canopy did differ between evergreen and deciduous trees. These differences were correlated with the density of shallow oak roots and not environmental differences. Oak trees also added species to the landscape pool, especially those with large canopy areas. Experimental manipulation of possible mechanisms suggested that for some native perennial grasses, a major limiting factor under oaks is interference from non-native annual grasses, particularly under trees. Together, these results suggest the influence of Quercus on California grasslands is multi-faceted, and may contribute to the distribution of non-native species on the landscape after extant trees are gone.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Kuris,"Host specificity is an important component of parasite ecology, determining the extent to which hosts are susceptible to infection by a particular parasite species at any given stage in its development. It can greatly influence the ecology of any stage in a parasite's life cycle plays and plays a significant role in parasite evolution. A parasite with broad host-specificity can be subdivided by host use into subpopulations. This in turn may affect the genetic diversity and the fate of the alleles under selection in a component parasite population, all individuals of a particular life stage in all hosts. If populations remain isolated for long periods of time, each sub-population may evolve to be a new species. Thus, understanding the relationship between host specificity and genetic diversity can help us to understand both the ecology and evolution of any parasite species with a complex life cycle. The larval stages of trematode parasite Acanthoparyphium spinulosum infect various invertebrates in Californian estuaries. Previously, A. spinulsoum have been considered to be a single species despite the broad host-use pattern. Together with non-overlapping distributions of second intermediate hosts within a wetland could result in population segregation by host use. To this end, genetic data was gathered for both mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) and the nuclear internal transcribed spacer 1(ITS1) loci from first intermediate hosts. Results suggest that A. spinulosum morphospecies represents a complex of cryptic species, which is differentially distributed between sites in Northern versus Southern California. Similarly, genetic data was obtained for parasites from second intermediate host species for COI and ITSI loci. Results from this larval stage suggest population segregation by second intermediate host use, such that metacercariae from Cerithidea californica all belonged to one clade. Metacercariae data from a clam and polychaete second intermediate host belonged to another clade. Finally, experimental infections were conducted to test the compatibility of the described genotypes (Chapter 2 and 3) for different second intermediate hosts. Fluorescent dye was used to distinguish between pre-existing and experimental infections.

Recent efforts have led to an improved understanding of larval dispersal, but there remains a paucity of studies that describe average dispersal patterns for marine species or examine the effects of dispersal on large-scale biogeographical patterns. This work first reviews literature on what role of physical features play haping species distributions through dispersal limitation in terrestrial and marine species. The review suggests that while there is some evidence that marine species distributions can be shaped by physical barriers to dispersal, there is far less work devoted to the issue than in terrestrial systems. In the third chapter, we present a new tool to measure larval abundance. We adapted existing protocols that label larvae using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and combined them with recent cell sorting technology (CS) so that larvae could be quickly and accurately sorted from plankton samples. Between chapters III and IV, we present DNA probes for three bivalve taxa: Musculista senhousia, Mytilus edulis/galloprovincialis/trossulus, and Mytilus californianus/Septifer spp, and one barnacle grouping of Tetraclita rubescens/ Chthamalus spp. In the fourth chapter, we employ FISH-CS to monitor the abundance of barnacle and mussel larvae in the Santa Barbara Harbor (SBH), California. Using these abundance data, we determined that the barnacle T. rubescens likely arrives at SBH from more distant sites while the mussels M. californianus and Septifer remain near SBH throughout development. In addition, we found that early- and late-stage barnacles were concentrated onshore by internal tides but mussels were not. Finally, we tested the theory that ocean currents can sufficiently limit larval dispersal to establish species' range limits, and examined the effects of a leaky barrier. We found the settlement of Septifer was significantly lower on the northern side of a potential current-driven dispersal filter at Point Conception, California. This decreased settlement corresponds with the species' northern range boundary. Current reversals were found to be correlated with increased settlement beyond the species' range edge, but the settlement was significantly lower than that observed within the adult distribution.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology","Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology",Armand M.

It can greatly influence the ecology of any stage in a parasite's life cycle plays and plays a significant role in parasite evolution. A parasite with broad host-specificity can be subdivided by host use into subpopulations. This in turn may affect the genetic diversity and the fate of the alleles under selection in a component parasite population, all individuals of a particular life stage in all hosts. If populations remain isolated for long periods of time, each sub-population may evolve to be a new species. Thus, understanding the relationship between host specificity and genetic diversity can help us to understand both the ecology and evolution of any parasite species with a complex life cycle. The larval stages of trematode parasite Acanthoparyphium spinulosum infect various invertebrates in Californian estuaries. Previously, A. spinulsoum have been considered to be a single species despite the broad host-use pattern. Together with non-overlapping distributions of second intermediate hosts within a wetland could result in population segregation by host use. To this end, genetic data was gathered for both mitochondrial cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) and the nuclear internal transcribed spacer 1(ITS1) loci from first intermediate hosts. Results suggest that A. spinulosum morphospecies represents a complex of cryptic species, which is differentially distributed between sites in Northern versus Southern California. Similarly, genetic data was obtained for parasites from second intermediate host species for COI and ITSI loci. Results from this larval stage suggest population segregation by second intermediate host use, such that metacercariae from Cerithidea californica all belonged to one clade. Metacercariae data from a clam and polychaete second intermediate host belonged to another clade. Finally, experimental infections were conducted to test the compatibility of the described genotypes (Chapter 2 and 3) for different second intermediate hosts.

Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology","Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology",Cheryl J. Briggs,"Mountain yellow-legged frogs (Rana muscosa and Rana sierrae) of California's Sierra Nevada have been extirpated from over 90% of their historic range, initially by introduced trout predators, and more recently by the emergence of the lethal amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis). Formerly widespread and abundant, mountain yellow-legged frogs are grazers and highly connected high level predators, living in low diversity, low productivity high elevation lakes. Here, I examine the extent to which frog extinctions impact Sierra Nevada lake communities. First, in a study that combined surveys of benthic macroinvertebrates in 22 lakes over 5 years with a reanalysis of benthic macroinvertebrate community data from over 150 lakes, I found no strong differences in benthic macroinvertebrate community diversity or composition between lakes with frogs vs. lakes without frogs. I also conducted experiments to evaluate the impact of tadpoles as grazers on benthic algae, and found that tadpoles do reduce algal biomass in artificial habitats, but that the effect can be small and may not outweigh the influence that abiotic variability has on algal biomass in lakes. Lastly, while I documented that large and periodic tadpole aggregations create biogeochemical hotspots of dissolved nitrogen, the phenomena may not be widespread enough to drive differences in diatom diversity in lakes with vs. without tadpoles. Within lakes, I found little indication that diatom community diversity and composition were responding to tadpole generated nitrogen hotspots as a fluctuation-dependent mechanism with potential to enhance diatom coexistence. While none of the ecological effects of mountain yellow-legged frogs and tadpoles that I observed suggests that their extinctions are having large impacts on Sierra Nevada lake communities, they should not be discounted as expendable, because there are many other ways in which these amphibians could be important in their communities.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology","Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology",Gretchen E. Hofmann,"Anthropogenic carbon emissions are predicted to alter marine ecosystems. One such change is the decline in ocean pH, known as ocean acidification. Model predictions of ocean acidification have guided biological experiments for more than a decade. Many studies predict negative consequences of future ocean pH on marine species. To understand how species will respond to future conditions, however, knowledge of present-day pH exposures is necessary and often limited. In this dissertation, I described present-day pH variability in three coastal regions and used the data to design laboratory experiments assessing the physiological response of two organisms, sea urchins and mussels, to changing ocean conditions. As recorded by autonomous pH sensors, I found three unique patterns of coastal pH variability. Near-shore Antarctica was characterized by a steep seasonal increase in pH and pH variability during summer phytoplankton blooms. The northern Channel Islands, California, exhibited event-scale and diurnal pH variability due to primary production of phytoplankton and fixed vegetation. Only mild effects from upwelling were detected at the islands, suggesting that this region may become a spatial refuge from extreme low pH in the future. Finally, Oregon was characterized by event-scale decreases in pH due to periodic upwelling events. The results from this research show that many coastal species experience short-term changes in pH that are within the same magnitude of change predicted for ocean acidification by the end of the century. While such present-day exposures to pH variability may promote tolerance of future pH change, these near-shore regions are also characterized by unique patterns of thermal stress. I conducted two studies to investigate the interactive effects of pH and temperature on organismal physiology. First, Antarctic sea urchin, Sterechinus neumayeri, early developmental stages (EDSs) currently experience < 2 C seasonal warming and may only experience a few degrees of ocean warming over the next 100 years. Despite development under pH and temperatures outside of current exposures, S. neumayeri EDSs exhibited high tolerance of a one-hour heat stress test, suggesting this species may be more resilient to ocean change than previously thought. Second, unlike Antarctic species, intertidal species at mid-latitudes experience daily temperature fluctuations that can exceed four times end-century predictions of ocean warming, due to tidal cycles. In Oregon, upwelling events enhance this temperature range by periodically delivering cold, low pH water to the intertidal zone. Depending on sea water conditions simulating an upwelling event (cold, low pH) or wind relaxation (warm, high pH), the intertidal mussel Mytilus californianus generated different transcriptomic signatures of the cellular heat shock response, following exposure to aerial heat stress. This suggests that future changes in seawater conditions may alter the heat stress tolerance of M. californianus during low tides. The results from this dissertation highlight the importance of designing experiments that reflect species' present-day and future multi-stressor environment, in order to generate ecologically relevant conclusions. As anthropogenic stressors continue to take hold of coastal seas, understanding the biological consequences is critical for management and conservation efforts.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology","Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology","Steven D. Gaines, Robert R. Warner","Body size has long been recognized as a key driver of species interactions and of an individual's role in the ecosystem. Body size determines the amount, species, and sizes of prey resources an individual can consume, as well as its own susceptibility to predators. Human harvest of predators can result in severe truncations in predator body size that can have cascading consequences on food webs. Where small and large individuals of the same species differ greatly in their diets, as is common in aquatic systems, the absence of large predators may functionally eliminate a key predator-prey linkage. Recently management agencies have begun to include size-based metrics as targets. As various harvest strategies differentially affect predator size and biomass, the research presented in this dissertation aims to understand the conditions under which truncations in predator size structure will result in additional loss of predator function than would be predicted from predator biomass alone, and where it will therefore be important to maintain predator size distributions. I specifically examine how the type of ontogenetic shift in diet (e.g. prey species or size class), and the shape of the diet switching function (e.g. gradual or abrupt) will affect the consequences of the loss of the largest predators, and the relative utility of various management strategies in maintaining predator function. In Chapter 1, I examined the tradeoffs between fishery yield and predator function in the ecosystem when preferentially fishing the largest predators. I found that fisheries that delay harvest until large predator sizes maximize fishery yield but that this virtually eliminates predation on focal prey eaten late in life history when diet shifts are abrupt and occur at or after the size at maturity. In this case, there is a clear tradeoff between fisheries and ecosystem objectives. Instead, where shifts in diet toward late prey are more gradual, targeting the largest predators can achieve a win-win by maximizing yield and achieving predation rates similar to that with other strategies that harvest predators earlier. As such, the optimal fishing strategy to achieve both single-species and ecosystem benefits depends strongly on the interaction between the fishery selectivity pattern and the changes in predator diet with size. In Chapter 2, I quantified the size-dependence of the predator-prey interaction between herbivorous sea urchins and one of their important predators in southern California kelp forests, California Sheephead. I further examined the consequences of changes in sheephead size and abundance in marine reserves at Catalina Island on size-specific urchin mortality in field predation trials. In my observations of predation of sheephead on urchins, sheephead smaller than 20cm TL do not eat urchins of any size. Thereafter, small sheephead only consumed small urchins, with larger sheephead sizes needed to successfully consume larger urchins, and the largest sheephead preferentially targeted the largest urchins. Inside marine reserves at Catalina, the greater abundance of large sheephead in combination with the observed size-specific capacities for urchin predation led to higher urchin mortality with marine reserve protection, particularly for the largest urchins. Ultimately, by restoring predator size structure, reserves may serve to enhance the resilience of southern California kelp forests. In Chapter 3, I examined how variation in predator body size distributions and biomass affects the likelihood of size escapes in situations where predators begin eating prey at some threshold size and thereafter consume increasingly larger prey. We focus on California sheephead because of the size dependence of its interaction with herbivorous sea urchins (Chapter 2), and the natural variation in demography where sheephead achieve smaller maximum sizes but higher biomass in the south of its range. We evaluate the consequences of smaller predator body size on top-down control of urchin populations in two scenarios: 1) when overall predator abundance is the same as the population with larger body size, and 2) when predator biomass is the same. With the same numbers of predators, top-down control was significantly weakened by the lack of large sheephead. However, when sheephead biomass was maintained, the absence of large sheephead did not lead to greater urchin abundance, despite lower predation rates overall and much lower predation on large urchins. Higher predation rates on the smallest urchin size classes served as a bottleneck that kept total urchin population at similar levels and prevented a size escape for the largest urchins. This suggests that where predators switch prey size classes in the same species, the loss of the largest individuals does not inherently result in weaker top-down control, if biomass is maintained, but effective control is sensitive to prey growth rates. The results of this research suggest that the ignoring shifts in predator size structure can under-estimate the effects of fishing on predator function, especially when large predators eat different species than their smaller counterparts. High predator biomass can compensate when diet shifts are to different prey size classes of the same species. Concordance between diet shifts and fishery selectivity can help identify where it will be important to consider changes in predator size in addition to biomass.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

D'Antonio,"The spread and rise to dominance of exotic species into the semi-arid grasslands of the western United States represents one of the most dramatic biological invasions to date. Currently, 90% of grasslands within California are dominated by exotic species, most notably exotic annual grasses from Europe. The research conducted here evaluates the effects of the widespread exotic annual grass, Bromus diandrus, and its thatch (i.e. dead persistent litter) on the physical and community structure in a central California grassland. The controls over Bromus diandrus persistence and spread in grasslands were also evaluated. Observational comparisons between native and exotic-dominated grassland patches were used to determine that exotic-dominated patches had more thatch and 3x less light at the soil surface than neighboring native patches. There were fewer species associated with exotic-dominated patches and species traits, such as timing of growth, seed size and plant height, were important in determining the distribution of species in the two patch types. Thatch and Bromus diandrus density were manipulated to evaluate the underlying mechanisms leading to native forb decline in grasslands invaded by Bromus diandrus. Thatch inhibited the performance of native forbs, while competition from living Bromus diandrus had little effect. There was also a positive Bromus diandrus-thatch feedback, whereby Bromus diandrus performed best with moderate amounts of thatch. The positive Bromus diandrus-thatch feedback may be one important factor contributing to the rise to dominance and persistence of this species in many grasslands. Given the negative effects of Bromus diandrus and its thatch on native species performance, I sought to understand the controls over its spread under predicted global change conditions. Bromus diandrus spread was facilitated by N enrichment and constrained by prolonged drought periods achieved through repatterned rainfall treatments. The invasion of the exotic annual grass, Bromus diandrus, into the grasslands of California has altered important plant resources, like light, and lead to the decline of many native forb species. Largely these biological impacts are mediated through the production of thatch, rather than living Bromus diandrus, indicating that management actions focusing on thatch removal will be the most promising for reducing the impact of this species.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology","Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology",Carla M. D'Antonio,"Over the last century many of the world's grassland and savanna communities have experienced significant changes in the abundance of shrubs and trees. In light of this there is a need to better understand the influences of trees on the herbaceous community. In particular, the potential for trees to exert long-term impacts on communities following their death and the role of spatial factors such canopy size or isolation in determining species diversity have rarely been evaluated in a single system. I used observational and experimental approaches to explore the overarching question: how do isolated Quercus in California grasslands affect the surrounding community? I specifically tested whether co-occurring deciduous and evergreen oaks influence understory composition differently and how this influence varies along a latitudinal gradient in California using an extensive survey. Because canopy oaks die often or have been actively removed I also evaluated the longevity of tree impact by surveying dead individuals. Using this survey data I examined how spatial heterogeneity in resources created by savanna trees as well as their relative arrangement within the grassland matrix contributes to landscape patterns of species richness. Lastly, I performed an experiment manipulating the mechanisms by which trees might create gradients in vegetation, focusing on the response of two species of native perennial grass that are potential restoration targets. I found a regionally consistent influence of oaks on understory species composition; all oaks were associated with increased abundance of non-native annual grasses. This pattern continued long after the death of the tree. Community composition outside the canopy did differ between evergreen and deciduous trees. These differences were correlated with the density of shallow oak roots and not environmental differences. Oak trees also added species to the landscape pool, especially those with large canopy areas. Experimental manipulation of possible mechanisms suggested that for some native perennial grasses, a major limiting factor under oaks is interference from non-native annual grasses, particularly under trees. Together, these results suggest the influence of Quercus on California grasslands is multi-faceted, and may contribute to the distribution of non-native species on the landscape after extant trees are gone.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Recent efforts have led to an improved understanding of larval dispersal, but there remains a paucity of studies that describe average dispersal patterns for marine species or examine the effects of dispersal on large-scale biogeographical patterns. This work first reviews literature on what role of physical features play haping species distributions through dispersal limitation in terrestrial and marine species. The review suggests that while there is some evidence that marine species distributions can be shaped by physical barriers to dispersal, there is far less work devoted to the issue than in terrestrial systems. In the third chapter, we present a new tool to measure larval abundance. We adapted existing protocols that label larvae using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and combined them with recent cell sorting technology (CS) so that larvae could be quickly and accurately sorted from plankton samples. Between chapters III and IV, we present DNA probes for three bivalve taxa: Musculista senhousia, Mytilus edulis/galloprovincialis/trossulus, and Mytilus californianus/Septifer spp, and one barnacle grouping of Tetraclita rubescens/ Chthamalus spp. In the fourth chapter, we employ FISH-CS to monitor the abundance of barnacle and mussel larvae in the Santa Barbara Harbor (SBH), California. Using these abundance data, we determined that the barnacle T. rubescens likely arrives at SBH from more distant sites while the mussels M. californianus and Septifer remain near SBH throughout development. In addition, we found that early- and late-stage barnacles were concentrated onshore by internal tides but mussels were not. Finally, we tested the theory that ocean currents can sufficiently limit larval dispersal to establish species' range limits, and examined the effects of a leaky barrier. We found the settlement of Septifer was significantly lower on the northern side of a potential current-driven dispersal filter at Point Conception, California. This decreased settlement corresponds with the species' northern range boundary. Current reversals were found to be correlated with increased settlement beyond the species' range edge, but the settlement was significantly lower than that observed within the adult distribution.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

My field research showed that these effects vary by site, season, and sampling technique/stratum, and are apparently modulated by the characteristics of both the invader and the invasion itself, including growth patterns, litter production, invader abundance, and native plant diversity. Even a relatively small amount of Carpobrotus edulis has negative effects on arthropod abundance, richness, and composition, with an exponential decrease in abundance and richness and a shift in composition well before 50% Carpobrotus cover. Changes in feeding guilds and composition helped to suggest the drivers of these patterns, and revealed a particularly strong effect on fossorial arthropods, likely related to the dense rooting structure of Carpobrotus. Thus, while the negative effects of non-native plant invasions typically increase with increasing invader cover, the form of this relationship is determined by the attributes of both the invader and the invaded system. For my dissertation work, I asked what effect non-native plant invasions are having on entire arthropod assemblages, and how that effect is related to the degree of invasion. I further asked how the responses by component feeding guilds contribute to these relationships. I answered these questions by conducting a meta-analysis and review of existing studies, then investigating the effects of one invader, Carpobrotus edulis, on coastal dune arthropods at four different coastal California sites. At Vandenberg Air Force Base, Montana de Oro State Park, and San Buenaventura State Beach, I utilized unmanipulated Carpobrotus populations to compare paired invaded and uninvaded patches and to investigate a gradient of Carpobrotus infestation. At Coal Oil Point Reserve, I conducted an experimental restoration trial, removing varying amounts of Carpobrotus and re-vegetating with native dune plants. Invertebrate responses to plant invasions can help delineate the drivers of biodiversity and community patterns, thus guiding the conservation and restoration of diverse native ecosystems. Although it is well known that invasive species have pervasive effects on native communities and ecosystems, our knowledge of the relative contributions of, and interactions among, key factors determining invader impacts is limited. Among potentially key factors is invader abundance, but few studies have examined its relationship to community structure. Those studies have shown varying relationships between invertebrate assemblages and invader cover, illustrating the need for additional studies on the forms and mechanisms of relationships between invertebrate biodiversity and invasive plant abundance.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Vascular vegetation dominates the biomass of the estuaries of California and Baja California, any changes in vegetation cover will subsequently have an effect on the abundance and distribution of snails. In chapter two, I present how crabs negatively affected snails through predation and non-lethal effects that changed the behavior and diminished the growth rates of snails. Predation pressure was especially high on eggs and the smallest size classes of snails, which had been overlooked in previous predation studies. Finally, in chapter three I present results on how low temperature seems likely to set the northern extent of the horn snail's range by reducing snail performance. The California horn snail (Cerithidea californica (Haldeman, 1840) (Potamididae: Prosobranchia) dominates the heterotrophic biomass of the salt marsh estuaries of California, Baja California, and Baja California Sur.

Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology","Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology","Sally Holbrook, Daniel C. Reed","I found that the natural course of progressive senescence in fronds can explain much of the variability in frond loss throughout a typical year in a Santa Barbara kelp bed, that kelp blades that have more access to light have shorter lifetimes (as predicted by leaf lifespan theory), and that ignoring the sub-lethal blade area losses can result in significant underestimates of net primary productivity. I believe that internal regulation of tissue turnover is an important mechanism by which giant kelp maximizes carbon gain in a changing environment and that adaptations that increase photosynthetic efficiency may be an important factor in the widespread success and dominance of Macrocystis.. Energy fixed by primary producers supports the vast majority of life on earth. The giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera is the largest marine alga in the world and supports one of the most productive ecosystems on earth. Carbon fixed by Macrocystis pyrifera on temparate rocky reefs not only provides essential habitat for an entire community of associated species, but also provides carbon subsidies to nearby ecological communities. Net primary productivity (NPP) is often used to quantify energy fixation by autotrophs, and researchers often measure NPP by summing the incremental increases in biomass and foliar losses. While the processes governing incremental increases in biomass have been well studied, the processes that drive the loss of foliar biomass are poorly understood. I investigated drivers that regulate frond and blade lifespan in Macrocystis, and the consequences of limited frond and blade lifespans. The first chapter is a long-term, multi-site analysis of frond lifetimes and exploration of internal and external drivers that could affect frond lifetime. This study provides broad spatial and temporal scope and identifies progressive senescence as an important driver of Macrocystis biomass dynamics. The second chapter employs a more focused field study to investigate whether spatial variability in light within a kelp forests affects lifespan, size, thickness, nitrogen content and pigment content of Macrocystis pyrifera blades in ways that are predicted by theory developed to predict leaf traits of vascular plants. The last chapter is a mathematical model of the system, which I parameterized with field data, to explicitly quantify the loss of blade tissue via erosion and quantify the amount of biomass not captured in traditional surveys of net primary productivity. The main theme of my research is the investigation of the drivers that regulate the lifespan of foliar biomass of giant kelp beds near Santa Barbara, California, USA. Tissue lifespan in marine macroalgae has not received much attention from either plant ecologists or algal ecologists, despite its potential importance to the dynamics of primary productivity. Macrocystis is an ideal species for investigations on tissue lifespan in macroalgae for two main reasons. First, it is well studied and much of its biology is already known, and second, Macrocystis is locally abundant, grows fast and turns over frequently. In addition, due to relatively benign environmental conditions for Macrocystis growth, the coastal margin along the Santa Barbara Channel is an ideal location to study intrinsic properties in the absence of extreme environmental forcing (such as frequent temperature spikes and severe storm events) that could overwhelm potentially important patterns.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Chapter 2 provides evidence that survival in adult surfperch responded to both prey availability and competition among adults. This work is a collaboration with Russ Schmitt and Sally Holbrook. Chapter 3 focuses on fertilization dynamics in sea urchins and the role that varying egg concentrations during spawning can have on the rate of fertilization when mixed with sperm.

Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology","Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology",Carla D'Antonio,"The meta-analysis showed negative effects of non-native plant invasions on arthropod richness, which are in part determined by the abundance of the invader, and are greatest at high levels of invader abundance (70% cover or greater). My field research showed that these effects vary by site, season, and sampling technique/stratum, and are apparently modulated by the characteristics of both the invader and the invasion itself, including growth patterns, litter production, invader abundance, and native plant diversity. Even a relatively small amount of Carpobrotus edulis has negative effects on arthropod abundance, richness, and composition, with an exponential decrease in abundance and richness and a shift in composition well before 50% Carpobrotus cover. Changes in feeding guilds and composition helped to suggest the drivers of these patterns, and revealed a particularly strong effect on fossorial arthropods, likely related to the dense rooting structure of Carpobrotus. Thus, while the negative effects of non-native plant invasions typically increase with increasing invader cover, the form of this relationship is determined by the attributes of both the invader and the invaded system. For my dissertation work, I asked what effect non-native plant invasions are having on entire arthropod assemblages, and how that effect is related to the degree of invasion. I further asked how the responses by component feeding guilds contribute to these relationships. I answered these questions by conducting a meta-analysis and review of existing studies, then investigating the effects of one invader, Carpobrotus edulis, on coastal dune arthropods at four different coastal California sites. At Vandenberg Air Force Base, Montana de Oro State Park, and San Buenaventura State Beach, I utilized unmanipulated Carpobrotus populations to compare paired invaded and uninvaded patches and to investigate a gradient of Carpobrotus infestation. At Coal Oil Point Reserve, I conducted an experimental restoration trial, removing varying amounts of Carpobrotus and re-vegetating with native dune plants. Invertebrate responses to plant invasions can help delineate the drivers of biodiversity and community patterns, thus guiding the conservation and restoration of diverse native ecosystems. Although it is well known that invasive species have pervasive effects on native communities and ecosystems, our knowledge of the relative contributions of, and interactions among, key factors determining invader impacts is limited. Among potentially key factors is invader abundance, but few studies have examined its relationship to community structure. Those studies have shown varying relationships between invertebrate assemblages and invader cover, illustrating the need for additional studies on the forms and mechanisms of relationships between invertebrate biodiversity and invasive plant abundance.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology","Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology","Sally Holbrook, Daniel C. Reed","I found that the natural course of progressive senescence in fronds can explain much of the variability in frond loss throughout a typical year in a Santa Barbara kelp bed, that kelp blades that have more access to light have shorter lifetimes (as predicted by leaf lifespan theory), and that ignoring the sub-lethal blade area losses can result in significant underestimates of net primary productivity. I believe that internal regulation of tissue turnover is an important mechanism by which giant kelp maximizes carbon gain in a changing environment and that adaptations that increase photosynthetic efficiency may be an important factor in the widespread success and dominance of Macrocystis.. Energy fixed by primary producers supports the vast majority of life on earth. The giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera is the largest marine alga in the world and supports one of the most productive ecosystems on earth. Carbon fixed by Macrocystis pyrifera on temparate rocky reefs not only provides essential habitat for an entire community of associated species, but also provides carbon subsidies to nearby ecological communities. Net primary productivity (NPP) is often used to quantify energy fixation by autotrophs, and researchers often measure NPP by summing the incremental increases in biomass and foliar losses. While the processes governing incremental increases in biomass have been well studied, the processes that drive the loss of foliar biomass are poorly understood. I investigated drivers that regulate frond and blade lifespan in Macrocystis, and the consequences of limited frond and blade lifespans. The first chapter is a long-term, multi-site analysis of frond lifetimes and exploration of internal and external drivers that could affect frond lifetime. This study provides broad spatial and temporal scope and identifies progressive senescence as an important driver of Macrocystis biomass dynamics. The second chapter employs a more focused field study to investigate whether spatial variability in light within a kelp forests affects lifespan, size, thickness, nitrogen content and pigment content of Macrocystis pyrifera blades in ways that are predicted by theory developed to predict leaf traits of vascular plants. The last chapter is a mathematical model of the system, which I parameterized with field data, to explicitly quantify the loss of blade tissue via erosion and quantify the amount of biomass not captured in traditional surveys of net primary productivity. The main theme of my research is the investigation of the drivers that regulate the lifespan of foliar biomass of giant kelp beds near Santa Barbara, California, USA. Tissue lifespan in marine macroalgae has not received much attention from either plant ecologists or algal ecologists, despite its potential importance to the dynamics of primary productivity. Macrocystis is an ideal species for investigations on tissue lifespan in macroalgae for two main reasons. First, it is well studied and much of its biology is already known, and second, Macrocystis is locally abundant, grows fast and turns over frequently. In addition, due to relatively benign environmental conditions for Macrocystis growth, the coastal margin along the Santa Barbara Channel is an ideal location to study intrinsic properties in the absence of extreme environmental forcing (such as frequent temperature spikes and severe storm events) that could overwhelm potentially important patterns.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Economics",Economics,Christopher Costello,"Problems arising from the common-pool nature of fisheries are well known (Gordon 1954). Recent research estimates the lost economic benefits from suboptimal fisheries production to be on the order of $50 billion annually (Arnason et al. 2009). Among the most promising management tools for improving fisheries performance are closed areas (marine reserves) and rights-based management (catch shares) (Worm et al. 2009). This collection of essays examines the emergence and performance of these two policy tools from an economics perspective. The first chapter examines the determinants of the transition from command and control regulation to rights-based management in common-pool resources. I develop a conceptual framework describing a regulator's decision to adopt a rights-based management regime in a common-pool resource and empirically test the hypotheses advanced in the framework with a duration analysis of rights-based management program adoption in a group of federally managed Alaska fisheries. Consistent with the conceptual framework, I find that rent dissipation along input cost and product value dimensions increases likelihood of program adoption, and high transaction costs decrease likelihood of program adoption. I find mixed evidence that resource depletion increases probability of program adoption. The second chapter examines the capacity of marine reserves to function as a cooperation mechanism in transboundary fisheries, stocks shared by two or more jurisdictions. Using a game theoretic model, we find that marine reserve implementation can achieve first-best equilibrium economic outcomes. We illustrate our theoretical predictions with a case study of the Chilean loco fishery. The third chapter estimates the economic and biological outcomes of the implementation of a marine reserve network at the California Channel Islands in 2003 on the Santa Barbara Area red sea urchin fishery. The paper develops an integrated bioeconomic model of the fishery consisting of an age structured population model and a discrete choice model of fishermen behavior linked via the fishing mortality rate. We calibrate the model using a 15-year panel dataset of fishery data and use the calibrated model to simulate outcomes under a counterfactual no-reserve scenario. We find that eight years after reserve implementation, urchin biomass is 53.7% higher, fishery yield is 11.3% lower, and fishery revenue is 10.9% lower compared to simulated outcomes under a counterfactual no-reserve policy.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Economics",Economics,Peter Rupert,"My dissertation studies the sectoral and regional reallocation of capital and labor for an economy in transition using general equilibrium model framework. The first chapter, ''Capital in Transition: Housing and Sectoral Reallocation in the Long Run'', studies the sectoral allocation of capital between housing and non-residential sectors using a two-sector general equilibrium model in a neoclassical growth environment. Calibrated to both the United States and China, the model can account for both the positive correlation between the share of housing capital and the consumption-output ratio in the United States and the negative correlation between the share of housing capital and the consumption-output ratio in China. The calibration to the Chinese economy implies that the rapid increase in the share of housing capital and the simultaneous decrease in the consumption-output ratio observed in China can be rationalized by a combination of three factors: a high elasticity of substitution between the two sectors, a high capital intensity of production of the housing sector, and a low initial share of housing capital before the Chinese housing market reform. This paper provides a tractable framework to understand the sectoral allocation of capital between housing and non-residential sectors across countries. The second chapter, ''Human Capital Spillover and Housing price'', provides a model framework to study the relationship between the external effect of human capital and housing price growth in the SEZ economy in China. In a two-region model, high wage in the SEZ region reflects high level of human capital, and these jobs are not available to low human capital migrants from the non-SEZ economy. The migrants come to the SEZ economy for two reasons: on the one hand, the SEZ economy is a better place to accumulate human capital and earn a higher wage in the future; on the other hand, the SEZ economy has a better amenities for living. In the baseline model with migration, the share of population that choose to migrate to the SEZ economy is determined by the utility equalization between living in either economy. In the baseline model, the migration occurs all at once at the first period. Further, I extend the baseline model by incorporating the spillover effect of human capital: time invested in human capital accumulation has a higher return in high human capital environment. In this case, the migration to the SEZ economy becomes increasingly attractive as the gap between the human capital leaders and followers increase. By comparing the extended model with the baseline, I capture the significant positive impact of human capital spillover on the increase of housing prices. The third chapter, ''Dynamic Arrow-Debreu Economy for General Equilibrium Analysis'', coauthored with Cheng-Zhong Qin, develops a dynamic Arrow-Debreu abstract economy to more closely capture the timing of moves of Walrasian general equilibrium model. Instead of inducing a pseudo game, the extensive form of the dynamic Arrow-Debreu abstract economy is well defined. As such, various game-theoretic solutions with and without symmetric information can be applied. We show that the set of subgame-perfect equilibrium allocations coincides with the set of Walrasian equilibrium allocations when information is symmetric. The set of perfect Bayesian equilibrium allocations coincides with the set of rational expectations equilibrium allocations when information is asymmetric. These results are useful for analyzing and refining Walrasian and rational expectations equilibrium allocations.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

The first chapter uses an event study to examine the transition from federal to state management of the Clean Water Act (CWA). I find that, overall, the transition from federal to state control has little effect on the fraction of facilities in violation. However, states with a long run prevalence of corruption see a large decrease in the fraction of facilities in violation after authorization relative to states without corruption. Alternative specifications support these findings. I explore whether the response to transition to state control differs across political ideology, GDP and income per capita, government size, environmental preferences and government management performance. None of these alternative state level characteristics seem to account for the observed difference. In the second chapter, joint work with Laura Grant, we measure the effects of nonprofit groups on enforcement and compliance of the Clean Water Act. We geographically link data from the EPA regarding facility inspections, violations, SNC Category I violations, enforcement actions and penalties with information about nearby nonprofit groups. Our results suggest that state governments decrease inspections as the number of groups increase. We also find a decrease in the most serious classification of effluent violations. However, we do not find changes in regulatory enforcement actions or penalties. The results suggest that groups affect compliance primarily through indirect oversight of firms rather than official regulatory channels. Using land cover as an instrumental variable strengthens our evidence that watershed groups encourage firm compliance and decrease official monitoring. In the third chapter, I examine the effectiveness of the Public Notification rule under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The Safe Drinking Water Act addresses harmful contaminants in drinking water by providing states the authority to monitor public water systems, notify the public of exceedances above allowable levels and cite persistent violators. Violating water systems are subject to intense regulatory and public scrutiny. The relationship between violation status and contaminant levels has not been explored empirically. This paper addresses this relationship through an event study using data on arsenic and nitrate levels in California. I find that violation status has a significant positive effect on nitrate levels post violation, but no effect on arsenic levels. I also examine the effect of the 2006 arsenic Maximum Contaminant Level revision, finding a discontinuity in contaminant levels at revision. These results suggest that while public disclosure may deter systems from violating, once they go into violation the Public Notification Rule is not effective at encouraging a return to compliance.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Finally, the third chapter estimates a compensating differential for fatality risk for workers in Mexico. An abstract for each chapter is provided below. Chapter 1 Abstract: Identifying a causal effect of labor market opportunities on criminal behavior is difficult given (a) an endogenous relationship between labor markets and crime and (b) the challenge of using aggregate measures to capture employment opportunities for individuals on the margin of criminal activity. The institutional structure of the California criminal justice system as well as location-, skill-, and industry-specific employment measures provide a unique framework to identify a causal effect. I find that a one-standard-deviation increase in the prevalence of relevant employment opportunities is associated with a 1 to 2 percent decrease in the probability released offenders return to prison. Chapter 2 Abstract: We study the behavior of a cluster-robust t statistic and make two principle contributions. First, we relax the restriction of previous asymptotic theory that clusters have identical size, and establish that the cluster-robust t statistic continues to have a Gaussian asymptotic null distribution. Second, we determine how variation in cluster sizes, together with other sources of cluster heterogeneity, affect the behavior of the test statistic. To do so, we determine the sample specific measure of cluster heterogeneity that governs this behavior and show that the measure depends on how three quantities vary over clusters: cluster size, the cluster specific error covariance matrix and the actual value of the covariates. Because, in the absence of a fixed design, the third quantity will always vary over clusters, the vast majority of empirical analyses have test statistics whose finite sample behavior is impacted by cluster heterogeneity. To capture this impact, we develop the effective number of clusters, which scales down the actual number of clusters by the measure of cluster heterogeneity. Through simulation we demonstrate this effect and find rejection rates as high as 30 percent for a nominal size of 5 percent. We then apply our measure of cluster heterogeneity in several empirical settings to show how observable variation over clusters impacts the performance of a cluster-robust test. Chapter 3 Abstract: The escalation in violence in recent years resulting from the Mexican government's war on drug trafficking has caused a large and unprecedented increase in workplace fatality risk for workers in Mexico. We exploit this increase to estimate a compensating differential for fatality risk using panel data constructed from a national employment and occupation survey. We also provide estimates of the value of a statistical life (VSL) in Mexico. Our results imply a VSL between $160,000 and $350,000 U.S dollars for a nationally representative sample of Mexican workers.

Previous studies have reported that physical tests administered to new recruits adversely impact women. Although interesting, these papers have not applied econometric analysis to determine the effects of physical exams on the composition of local police departments. Instead they use case studies and test of means to derive their conclusions. The purpose of this paper is to use econometric analysis to determine the discriminatory effects of physical exams. Our main contribution is to use a fixed effects approach to control for unobserved discrimination. Our results indicate that once discrimination has been controlled for physical exams do not affect the proportion of women employed in police departments. The second paper investigates the economic variables and data used to model notices of default in California during the financial crisis of 2008--2009. Forecast models are notoriously complicated and require sophisticated software to run. Few businesses, particularly small enterprises, have the necessary resources to engage in large-scale model building. Furthermore, data can be difficult and expensive to obtain and usually requires significant analysis. The paper will focus on methodology to give the model a general appeal.

Each year foreign aid organizations give billions of dollars to developing countries with the goal of improving their economic and social welfare.

Economics",Economics,Christopher Costello,"Problems arising from the common-pool nature of fisheries are well known (Gordon 1954). Recent research estimates the lost economic benefits from suboptimal fisheries production to be on the order of $50 billion annually (Arnason et al. 2009). Among the most promising management tools for improving fisheries performance are closed areas (marine reserves) and rights-based management (catch shares) (Worm et al. 2009). This collection of essays examines the emergence and performance of these two policy tools from an economics perspective. The first chapter examines the determinants of the transition from command and control regulation to rights-based management in common-pool resources. I develop a conceptual framework describing a regulator's decision to adopt a rights-based management regime in a common-pool resource and empirically test the hypotheses advanced in the framework with a duration analysis of rights-based management program adoption in a group of federally managed Alaska fisheries. Consistent with the conceptual framework, I find that rent dissipation along input cost and product value dimensions increases likelihood of program adoption, and high transaction costs decrease likelihood of program adoption. I find mixed evidence that resource depletion increases probability of program adoption. The second chapter examines the capacity of marine reserves to function as a cooperation mechanism in transboundary fisheries, stocks shared by two or more jurisdictions. Using a game theoretic model, we find that marine reserve implementation can achieve first-best equilibrium economic outcomes. We illustrate our theoretical predictions with a case study of the Chilean loco fishery. The third chapter estimates the economic and biological outcomes of the implementation of a marine reserve network at the California Channel Islands in 2003 on the Santa Barbara Area red sea urchin fishery. The paper develops an integrated bioeconomic model of the fishery consisting of an age structured population model and a discrete choice model of fishermen behavior linked via the fishing mortality rate. We calibrate the model using a 15-year panel dataset of fishery data and use the calibrated model to simulate outcomes under a counterfactual no-reserve scenario. We find that eight years after reserve implementation, urchin biomass is 53.7% higher, fishery yield is 11.3% lower, and fishery revenue is 10.9% lower compared to simulated outcomes under a counterfactual no-reserve policy.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Economics",Economics,"Robert Deacon, Paulina Oliva","This dissertation consists of three separate papers in environmental economics. The first chapter uses an event study to examine the transition from federal to state management of the Clean Water Act (CWA). I find that, overall, the transition from federal to state control has little effect on the fraction of facilities in violation. However, states with a long run prevalence of corruption see a large decrease in the fraction of facilities in violation after authorization relative to states without corruption. Alternative specifications support these findings. I explore whether the response to transition to state control differs across political ideology, GDP and income per capita, government size, environmental preferences and government management performance. None of these alternative state level characteristics seem to account for the observed difference. In the second chapter, joint work with Laura Grant, we measure the effects of nonprofit groups on enforcement and compliance of the Clean Water Act. We geographically link data from the EPA regarding facility inspections, violations, SNC Category I violations, enforcement actions and penalties with information about nearby nonprofit groups. Our results suggest that state governments decrease inspections as the number of groups increase. We also find a decrease in the most serious classification of effluent violations. However, we do not find changes in regulatory enforcement actions or penalties. The results suggest that groups affect compliance primarily through indirect oversight of firms rather than official regulatory channels. Using land cover as an instrumental variable strengthens our evidence that watershed groups encourage firm compliance and decrease official monitoring. In the third chapter, I examine the effectiveness of the Public Notification rule under the Safe Drinking Water Act. The Safe Drinking Water Act addresses harmful contaminants in drinking water by providing states the authority to monitor public water systems, notify the public of exceedances above allowable levels and cite persistent violators. Violating water systems are subject to intense regulatory and public scrutiny. The relationship between violation status and contaminant levels has not been explored empirically. This paper addresses this relationship through an event study using data on arsenic and nitrate levels in California. I find that violation status has a significant positive effect on nitrate levels post violation, but no effect on arsenic levels. I also examine the effect of the 2006 arsenic Maximum Contaminant Level revision, finding a discontinuity in contaminant levels at revision. These results suggest that while public disclosure may deter systems from violating, once they go into violation the Public Notification Rule is not effective at encouraging a return to compliance.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Economics",Economics,"Peter J. Kuhn, Douglas G. Steigerwald","This dissertation consists of three distinct papers. The first chapter estimates the effect of local labor market opportunities on crime among individuals exiting prison in California. The second chapter studies the behavior of the cluster robust variance estimator, commonly used in empirical research, when standard assumptions regarding the structure of observations across groups are relaxed. Finally, the third chapter estimates a compensating differential for fatality risk for workers in Mexico. An abstract for each chapter is provided below. Chapter 1 Abstract: Identifying a causal effect of labor market opportunities on criminal behavior is difficult given (a) an endogenous relationship between labor markets and crime and (b) the challenge of using aggregate measures to capture employment opportunities for individuals on the margin of criminal activity. The institutional structure of the California criminal justice system as well as location-, skill-, and industry-specific employment measures provide a unique framework to identify a causal effect. I find that a one-standard-deviation increase in the prevalence of relevant employment opportunities is associated with a 1 to 2 percent decrease in the probability released offenders return to prison. Chapter 2 Abstract: We study the behavior of a cluster-robust t statistic and make two principle contributions. First, we relax the restriction of previous asymptotic theory that clusters have identical size, and establish that the cluster-robust t statistic continues to have a Gaussian asymptotic null distribution. Second, we determine how variation in cluster sizes, together with other sources of cluster heterogeneity, affect the behavior of the test statistic. To do so, we determine the sample specific measure of cluster heterogeneity that governs this behavior and show that the measure depends on how three quantities vary over clusters: cluster size, the cluster specific error covariance matrix and the actual value of the covariates. Because, in the absence of a fixed design, the third quantity will always vary over clusters, the vast majority of empirical analyses have test statistics whose finite sample behavior is impacted by cluster heterogeneity. To capture this impact, we develop the effective number of clusters, which scales down the actual number of clusters by the measure of cluster heterogeneity. Through simulation we demonstrate this effect and find rejection rates as high as 30 percent for a nominal size of 5 percent. We then apply our measure of cluster heterogeneity in several empirical settings to show how observable variation over clusters impacts the performance of a cluster-robust test. Chapter 3 Abstract: The escalation in violence in recent years resulting from the Mexican government's war on drug trafficking has caused a large and unprecedented increase in workplace fatality risk for workers in Mexico. We exploit this increase to estimate a compensating differential for fatality risk using panel data constructed from a national employment and occupation survey. We also provide estimates of the value of a statistical life (VSL) in Mexico. Our results imply a VSL between $160,000 and $350,000 U.S dollars for a nationally representative sample of Mexican workers.

Education",Education,Hsiu-Zu Ho,"Results of the study showed that Southeast Asian Americans who were committed to their ethnic identities prior to college continued to explore their ethnic identities in college. Ethnic exploration occurred predominantly within social spaces, such as within ethnic student organizations. Parents' prior ethnic socialization continued to influence whether students were committed to their ethnic identities. Although participation in ethnic practices and traditions had generally declined in college, students maintained cultural beliefs and values that were conducive towards academic success and college persistence. With respect to college integration, students were generally socially integrated only within ethnic- and racial-related spaces. Contrary to what was expected, female students remained committed to their ethnic group even if they were in disagreement with their parents' and ethnic community's traditional gender expectations. Lastly, the findings suggested that choices in ethnic and racial identity labels varied across contexts and that ethnic identity was relevant to student development and possibly college success. The Southeast Asian American students' cultural identities contributed to their social integration, and that social integration supported the students' overall persistence in college. This study included individual interviews with a sample of 27 Southeast Asian American students that were all attending the same four-year university in California. Participants were recruited from campus spaces that were predicted to have a large Southeast Asian American presence. The interview guide addressed students' prior ethnic socialization experiences before entering college and also students' ethnic- and non-ethnic-based experiences since arriving to college. Participants were asked specific questions pertaining to ethnic identity exploration and commitment. Line-by-line coding was conducted on the interview transcripts and themes were organized across the interviews to address the four major research questions of the study. The perception of the high-achieving Asian American student can make invisible the challenges these students face as ethnic minorities on their college campuses. In particular, Southeast Asian American students, such as those of Cambodian, Laotian, and Vietnamese descent, encounter additional barriers because of the circumstances of their parents' migration experiences and the ethnic socialization that occurs within their families and communities. Most current research that has been conducted on Asian Americans in higher education has not focused specifically on Southeast Asian American students. As argued by Teranishi, Behringer, Grey, and Parker (2009), college student development models may not be inclusive of the experiences of Southeast Asian American students, especially since those models may not account for how academic development can intersect with students' ethnic identity development. Primarily based on Tinto's (1975) college retention model, this present study examined the college integration and ethnic identity development of a sample of Southeast Asian American undergraduate students.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Data were thematically analyzed in multiple rounds with an intersectional lens, which resulted in three sets of findings: how mathematics majors perceived gender to have impacted university mathematics and their experiences, how mathematics majors perceived ethnicity to have impacted university mathematics and their experiences, and the ways the Bachelor of Arts (BA) degrees were feminized and devalued by students, professors, and the department. These findings suggest that bias around gender and ethnicity in postsecondary mathematics continues, and pervasive stereotypes about ""good"" mathematics students as predominantly European American and male exist.

Education",Education,Judith L. Green,"For many immigrant groups living in host countries, the fostering and maintenance of their heritage language and culture or languaculture (Agar, 1994, 2006) are placed as the sole responsibility of the immigrants and their families (Kloss, 1998). As such, the establishment of the majority of the heritage language schools in the United States has always been a private endeavor carried out by the ethnic communities themselves (Fishman & Nahirny, 1966; Zhou & Li, 2003). Previous studies have well documented independently run community heritage language schools across the United States (Bradunas, 1988; Chik, 2010; Long, Needham, 1996; Shibata, 2000). This dissertation contributes to this body of work by examining an alternative framework used to establish a heritage language school, a multi-institutional partnership in which different groups of people from the heritage community as well as the geopolitical community joined forces in providing ethnic language program for their community members. Grounded in an ethnographic perspective and using constructs of discourse analysis and intertextuality, this two-year ethnographic case study focuses on a community-based Khmer heritage language program in California. In particular, by focusing on the individuals who spearheaded the language program, this study explores their role in constructing a language learning environment for their community members. Questions guiding this study include: What factors contribute to the construction of this learning environment? How do their inter-agencies influence the creation of this language program? How do the founders' past histories shape and influence the current language program? What factors contribute to the construction of this learning environment? How do their inter-agencies influence the creation of this language program? How do the founders' past histories shape and influence the current language program? The study led to the identification of a multi-institutional partnership that was facilitated by the individuals' prior experience with similar events, their social networks and relationships that were built through their sustaining residence in the community as well as their inter-agency relationships that they brought to the process to ensure the actualization of the collaboration. The data also showed how the partnership fostered home-community connections among stakeholders involved, how multi-layer resources are needed in sustaining the program as well as how the partners spoke about the power and efficacy of community force. The findings, therefore, form the basis for a multi-agency partnership framework that reflects the nature of the weekend-language program and its benefits that otherwise would not exist if the program was independently run.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Education",Education,Sharon Conley,"This study explored the perceptions of the staff and faculty of one writing program in a large western university, the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). The Writing Program had experienced significant changes including budgetary reductions since 2008 as well as turnover in leadership. These changes have impacted the culture of the organization. Interest in organizational culture is related to a larger concern in organizational theory with managing uncertainty. Martin (1992; 2002) suggests that all organizations exhibit levels of ambiguity or uncertainty. To describe and explain how the writing program used in this study deals with uncertainty and change in the environment over time, I used Martin's (1992; 2002) three perspective theory of organizational culture. This study primarily used qualitative interviewing, informed by the single case study design (Yin, 2009). The study was actualized in two phases; wherein Phase 1 served as a pilot study for Phase 2. The findings showed that challenges to the Writing Program included turnover in the director position and an uncertain budgetary climate in the university at large. From an integration perspective, the leaders of the Writing Program fostered a shared culture of collegiality and generosity. Subcultures in Phase 1 and Phase 2 were generally similar. Informants in both phases identified subcultures across disciplines and curricular focus as well as administration and instructional staff. Through the lens of the fragmentation perspective the Writing Program exhibited elements of fragmentation in both phases. During Phase 1 informants were concerned about the Writing Program's status as a function of its position as a less powerful program within the university. During Phase 2 newer organizational members revealed that they did not identify with certain subcultures and did not always know what issues and problems were at odds in the program. The personnel review process, lead by the personnel committee chair, provided a source of high personal uncertainty and organizational ambiguity. In this study Martin's (1992) perspectives facilitated description and explanation of organizational culture.

Instructional strategies and educational philosophies are always changing. One constant, however, is the achievement gap between ELLs and mainstream students continue to widen. Thus, it is imperative to identify effective instructional programs for educating ELLs, particularly in their English language development. This research adds to current knowledge in regard to effective educational programs for the growing number of ELLs. The elementary school in the study implements both TBE and SEI programs. This study examined English language development between students who have been in the TBE vs. SEI programs consecutively for 4 years, as measured by the California English Language Development Test (CELDT). Students' oral proficiency (listening and speaking) scores were collected in grades K-3 and student's' literacy proficiency (reading and writing) scores were collected in grades 2-3. Using repeated measures MANOVA procedures, the study found that both programs continue to demonstrate growth in all areas of the CELDT in the first 3 years of enrollment in a TBE program; the students scored lower than their SEI peers in their oral proficiency. This may partly be due to the fact that in Kindergarten the students with lower English proficiency were placed into the TBE program, and students with higher English proficiency were placed in the SEI program. Interestingly, the gap between the SEI and TBE students' oral proficiency scores decreased over the first 3 years. In fact, in the last year, the TBE students scored higher than the SEI students in their oral proficiency. As for literacy scores, in grade 2, the SEI students outperformed the TBE students, but in grade 3, the TBE students had a higher average in their literacy scores than the SEI students, although it was not statistically significant for both oral and literacy proficiency.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

As such, the purpose of this study was to describe and analyze the degree to which teachers' perceptions of their understanding of retirement, sufficiency of retirement, and preference for defined benefit may contribute to retirement satisfaction, career satisfaction, and openness to changing the retirement system. A survey design was used to gather data from teachers in three California districts. Nearly 230 teachers submitted usable surveys. Factor analyses were used to confirm both independent and dependent variables of study. Four factors emerged related to independent variables: understanding of retirement, sufficiency of retirement, preference for defined benefit, and preference for personal retirement control. Five factors emerged related to dependent variables: retirement satisfaction, personal career satisfaction, compensation satisfaction, openness to major system change, and openness to strengthening the retirement system. Among the findings were that teachers' perceptions of understanding of retirement, sufficiency of retirement, and preference for personal retirement control were all significant predictors of retirement satisfaction. Furthermore, perceptions of sufficiency of retirement were a significant predictor of compensation satisfaction. Preference for defined benefit and preference for personal retirement control were both significant predictors for openness to major system change. This finding indicated that teachers' preference for defined benefit had a negative predictive effect on openness to major system change. In addition, those preferring personal retirement control had a positive effect on openness to major system change. Analyzing teachers by experience showed that teachers with high experience (more than 15 years) had a higher satisfaction of retirement, understanding of retirement, and preference for defined benefit than less experienced teachers. Contrastingly, lower experience teachers had a higher openness to major system change and a higher preference for personal retirement control. These differences suggest that experienced teachers are generally more satisfied and content with their retirement but newer teachers are likely more open to potential system overhauls being considered within the state studied.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Education",Education,Hsiu-Zu Ho,"Results of the study showed that Southeast Asian Americans who were committed to their ethnic identities prior to college continued to explore their ethnic identities in college. Ethnic exploration occurred predominantly within social spaces, such as within ethnic student organizations. Parents' prior ethnic socialization continued to influence whether students were committed to their ethnic identities. Although participation in ethnic practices and traditions had generally declined in college, students maintained cultural beliefs and values that were conducive towards academic success and college persistence. With respect to college integration, students were generally socially integrated only within ethnic- and racial-related spaces. Contrary to what was expected, female students remained committed to their ethnic group even if they were in disagreement with their parents' and ethnic community's traditional gender expectations. Lastly, the findings suggested that choices in ethnic and racial identity labels varied across contexts and that ethnic identity was relevant to student development and possibly college success. The Southeast Asian American students' cultural identities contributed to their social integration, and that social integration supported the students' overall persistence in college. This study included individual interviews with a sample of 27 Southeast Asian American students that were all attending the same four-year university in California. Participants were recruited from campus spaces that were predicted to have a large Southeast Asian American presence. The interview guide addressed students' prior ethnic socialization experiences before entering college and also students' ethnic- and non-ethnic-based experiences since arriving to college. Participants were asked specific questions pertaining to ethnic identity exploration and commitment. Line-by-line coding was conducted on the interview transcripts and themes were organized across the interviews to address the four major research questions of the study. The perception of the high-achieving Asian American student can make invisible the challenges these students face as ethnic minorities on their college campuses. In particular, Southeast Asian American students, such as those of Cambodian, Laotian, and Vietnamese descent, encounter additional barriers because of the circumstances of their parents' migration experiences and the ethnic socialization that occurs within their families and communities. Most current research that has been conducted on Asian Americans in higher education has not focused specifically on Southeast Asian American students. As argued by Teranishi, Behringer, Grey, and Parker (2009), college student development models may not be inclusive of the experiences of Southeast Asian American students, especially since those models may not account for how academic development can intersect with students' ethnic identity development. Primarily based on Tinto's (1975) college retention model, this present study examined the college integration and ethnic identity development of a sample of Southeast Asian American undergraduate students.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Education",Education,Judith L. Green,"For many immigrant groups living in host countries, the fostering and maintenance of their heritage language and culture or languaculture (Agar, 1994, 2006) are placed as the sole responsibility of the immigrants and their families (Kloss, 1998). As such, the establishment of the majority of the heritage language schools in the United States has always been a private endeavor carried out by the ethnic communities themselves (Fishman & Nahirny, 1966; Zhou & Li, 2003). Previous studies have well documented independently run community heritage language schools across the United States (Bradunas, 1988; Chik, 2010; Long, Needham, 1996; Shibata, 2000). This dissertation contributes to this body of work by examining an alternative framework used to establish a heritage language school, a multi-institutional partnership in which different groups of people from the heritage community as well as the geopolitical community joined forces in providing ethnic language program for their community members. Grounded in an ethnographic perspective and using constructs of discourse analysis and intertextuality, this two-year ethnographic case study focuses on a community-based Khmer heritage language program in California. In particular, by focusing on the individuals who spearheaded the language program, this study explores their role in constructing a language learning environment for their community members. Questions guiding this study include: What factors contribute to the construction of this learning environment? How do their inter-agencies influence the creation of this language program? How do the founders' past histories shape and influence the current language program? What factors contribute to the construction of this learning environment? How do their inter-agencies influence the creation of this language program? How do the founders' past histories shape and influence the current language program? The study led to the identification of a multi-institutional partnership that was facilitated by the individuals' prior experience with similar events, their social networks and relationships that were built through their sustaining residence in the community as well as their inter-agency relationships that they brought to the process to ensure the actualization of the collaboration. The data also showed how the partnership fostered home-community connections among stakeholders involved, how multi-layer resources are needed in sustaining the program as well as how the partners spoke about the power and efficacy of community force. The findings, therefore, form the basis for a multi-agency partnership framework that reflects the nature of the weekend-language program and its benefits that otherwise would not exist if the program was independently run.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

This study examined the social and political activism of a group of undocumented immigrant youth in Southern California as they organized in order to gain access to higher education and advocate for immigration reform. This ethnographic study explored the learning processes and outcomes for immigrant youth as they developed their leadership skills and participated in organizing and activism in their schools and communities. The immigrant youth were part of a community-based youth organization called, Youth United for Immigrant Rights. Youth United students helped their classmates understand the social, political, and economic context of immigrant rights, and participated in marches, rallies, phone banking, and direct actions to inform their peers and community members about issues facing immigrants. Data collection included participant observations of the youth group's weekly organizing meetings as well as semi-structured interviews with 15 youth and 10 previous youth activists over the course of sixteen months. Findings suggest that these immigrant high school students developed critical youth development outcomes through their organizing efforts, particularly related to their development of leadership skills and qualities, their identity as undocumented or immigrant youth, and their understanding of social and political inequities affecting the immigrant community.

Education",Education,Jin Sook Lee,"The purpose of the study was to examine the effects of transitional bilingual education (TBE) and structured English immersion (SEI) instructional models on the development of English language learners (ELLs). Instructional strategies and educational philosophies are always changing. One constant, however, is the achievement gap between ELLs and mainstream students continue to widen. Thus, it is imperative to identify effective instructional programs for educating ELLs, particularly in their English language development. This research adds to current knowledge in regard to effective educational programs for the growing number of ELLs. The elementary school in the study implements both TBE and SEI programs. This study examined English language development between students who have been in the TBE vs. SEI programs consecutively for 4 years, as measured by the California English Language Development Test (CELDT). Students' oral proficiency (listening and speaking) scores were collected in grades K-3 and student's' literacy proficiency (reading and writing) scores were collected in grades 2-3. Using repeated measures MANOVA procedures, the study found that both programs continue to demonstrate growth in all areas of the CELDT in the first 3 years of enrollment in a TBE program; the students scored lower than their SEI peers in their oral proficiency. This may partly be due to the fact that in Kindergarten the students with lower English proficiency were placed into the TBE program, and students with higher English proficiency were placed in the SEI program. Interestingly, the gap between the SEI and TBE students' oral proficiency scores decreased over the first 3 years. In fact, in the last year, the TBE students scored higher than the SEI students in their oral proficiency. As for literacy scores, in grade 2, the SEI students outperformed the TBE students, but in grade 3, the TBE students had a higher average in their literacy scores than the SEI students, although it was not statistically significant for both oral and literacy proficiency.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

The findings, therefore, form the basis for a multi-agency partnership framework that reflects the nature of the weekend-language program and its benefits that otherwise would not exist if the program was independently run.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Education",Education,Sharon Conley,"This study explored the perceptions of the staff and faculty of one writing program in a large western university, the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB). The Writing Program had experienced significant changes including budgetary reductions since 2008 as well as turnover in leadership. These changes have impacted the culture of the organization. Interest in organizational culture is related to a larger concern in organizational theory with managing uncertainty. Martin (1992; 2002) suggests that all organizations exhibit levels of ambiguity or uncertainty. To describe and explain how the writing program used in this study deals with uncertainty and change in the environment over time, I used Martin's (1992; 2002) three perspective theory of organizational culture. This study primarily used qualitative interviewing, informed by the single case study design (Yin, 2009). The study was actualized in two phases; wherein Phase 1 served as a pilot study for Phase 2. The findings showed that challenges to the Writing Program included turnover in the director position and an uncertain budgetary climate in the university at large. From an integration perspective, the leaders of the Writing Program fostered a shared culture of collegiality and generosity. Subcultures in Phase 1 and Phase 2 were generally similar. Informants in both phases identified subcultures across disciplines and curricular focus as well as administration and instructional staff. Through the lens of the fragmentation perspective the Writing Program exhibited elements of fragmentation in both phases. During Phase 1 informants were concerned about the Writing Program's status as a function of its position as a less powerful program within the university. During Phase 2 newer organizational members revealed that they did not identify with certain subcultures and did not always know what issues and problems were at odds in the program. The personnel review process, lead by the personnel committee chair, provided a source of high personal uncertainty and organizational ambiguity. In this study Martin's (1992) perspectives facilitated description and explanation of organizational culture. By viewing people and organizations as integrated, differentiated, and fragmented, nuance and complexity are acknowledged as part of shared existence.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Education",Education,Mary B. Brenner,"Immigrant and undocumented high school students are becoming more active in the struggle for educational and human rights for immigrants. This study examined the social and political activism of a group of undocumented immigrant youth in Southern California as they organized in order to gain access to higher education and advocate for immigration reform. This ethnographic study explored the learning processes and outcomes for immigrant youth as they developed their leadership skills and participated in organizing and activism in their schools and communities. The immigrant youth were part of a community-based youth organization called, Youth United for Immigrant Rights. Youth United students helped their classmates understand the social, political, and economic context of immigrant rights, and participated in marches, rallies, phone banking, and direct actions to inform their peers and community members about issues facing immigrants. Data collection included participant observations of the youth group's weekly organizing meetings as well as semi-structured interviews with 15 youth and 10 previous youth activists over the course of sixteen months. Findings suggest that these immigrant high school students developed critical youth development outcomes through their organizing efforts, particularly related to their development of leadership skills and qualities, their identity as undocumented or immigrant youth, and their understanding of social and political inequities affecting the immigrant community. These processes prepared them to take direct action in their school and community and contributed to their pursuit of a college education.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Education",Education,Jin Sook Lee,"The purpose of the study was to examine the effects of transitional bilingual education (TBE) and structured English immersion (SEI) instructional models on the development of English language learners (ELLs). Instructional strategies and educational philosophies are always changing. One constant, however, is the achievement gap between ELLs and mainstream students continue to widen. Thus, it is imperative to identify effective instructional programs for educating ELLs, particularly in their English language development. This research adds to current knowledge in regard to effective educational programs for the growing number of ELLs. The elementary school in the study implements both TBE and SEI programs. This study examined English language development between students who have been in the TBE vs. SEI programs consecutively for 4 years, as measured by the California English Language Development Test (CELDT). Students' oral proficiency (listening and speaking) scores were collected in grades K-3 and student's' literacy proficiency (reading and writing) scores were collected in grades 2-3. Using repeated measures MANOVA procedures, the study found that both programs continue to demonstrate growth in all areas of the CELDT in the first 3 years of enrollment in a TBE program; the students scored lower than their SEI peers in their oral proficiency. This may partly be due to the fact that in Kindergarten the students with lower English proficiency were placed into the TBE program, and students with higher English proficiency were placed in the SEI program. Interestingly, the gap between the SEI and TBE students' oral proficiency scores decreased over the first 3 years. In fact, in the last year, the TBE students scored higher than the SEI students in their oral proficiency. As for literacy scores, in grade 2, the SEI students outperformed the TBE students, but in grade 3, the TBE students had a higher average in their literacy scores than the SEI students, although it was not statistically significant for both oral and literacy proficiency.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Education",Education,Sharon Conley,"Concerns over fiscal and personal appropriateness for public retirement pensions have become prevalent within conversations throughout the United States. However, with some important exceptions (e.g., DeArmond and Goldhaber, 2010) limited research has focused upon perceptions of teachers who receive these pension plans. As such, the purpose of this study was to describe and analyze the degree to which teachers' perceptions of their understanding of retirement, sufficiency of retirement, and preference for defined benefit may contribute to retirement satisfaction, career satisfaction, and openness to changing the retirement system. A survey design was used to gather data from teachers in three California districts. Nearly 230 teachers submitted usable surveys. Factor analyses were used to confirm both independent and dependent variables of study. Four factors emerged related to independent variables: understanding of retirement, sufficiency of retirement, preference for defined benefit, and preference for personal retirement control. Five factors emerged related to dependent variables: retirement satisfaction, personal career satisfaction, compensation satisfaction, openness to major system change, and openness to strengthening the retirement system. Among the findings were that teachers' perceptions of understanding of retirement, sufficiency of retirement, and preference for personal retirement control were all significant predictors of retirement satisfaction. Furthermore, perceptions of sufficiency of retirement were a significant predictor of compensation satisfaction. Preference for defined benefit and preference for personal retirement control were both significant predictors for openness to major system change. This finding indicated that teachers' preference for defined benefit had a negative predictive effect on openness to major system change. In addition, those preferring personal retirement control had a positive effect on openness to major system change. Analyzing teachers by experience showed that teachers with high experience (more than 15 years) had a higher satisfaction of retirement, understanding of retirement, and preference for defined benefit than less experienced teachers. Contrastingly, lower experience teachers had a higher openness to major system change and a higher preference for personal retirement control. These differences suggest that experienced teachers are generally more satisfied and content with their retirement but newer teachers are likely more open to potential system overhauls being considered within the state studied.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

This dissertation study examined Latina/o undergraduate students to understand their aspirations for graduate and professional education using a sample of undergraduate Latina/o students from the University of California undergraduate experience survey. Structural equation modeling results indicated that Latina/o undergraduate students' perception of access to academic resources and instruction positively predict their aspirations to pursue post-baccalaureate education. Moreover, more positive perceptions of access to academic resources mediate the relationship between students' perceptions of their own pre-college academic abilities and aspirations to pursue graduate education.

Education",Education,"Mary Betsy Brenner, Dawn Holmes","Statistics education researchers are urging teachers of statistics to help students develop a more sophisticated understanding of variation, since variation is the core of statistics. However, little research has been done into the conceptions of variation held by instructors of statistics. This is of particular importance at the community college level because there was a 60% increase in enrollment in introductory statistics courses in a recent five-year period. Moreover, at the community college level only 2% of full-time instructors and 2% of part-time instructors have a degree in statistics. This exploratory study was designed to map the conceptions of variation held by two-year college mathematics instructors. A total of 52 instructors from 33 different California community colleges responded to a survey designed to reveal instructors' conception of variation. All of the instructors had a degree in mathematics---seven of them also had a degree in statistics. Instructors had varied statistics teaching experience: 23 of them had never taught statistics and 29 had taught statistics often. The results of the study indicated that there was a difference in the type of responses; however, their educational background or their statistics teaching experience did not highlight the difference. The results indicate that some instructors readily acknowledge variability and others do not. A tendency to focus only on the center of the distribution seemed to prevail, and very few instructors gave explanations integrating different aspects of the distribution. The majority focused on the center or on the range. Another salient characteristic of the results of this study was instructors' lack of consideration for context when making decisions about variability in the data. Moreover, this study revealed that instructors were not consistent throughout the survey items. In some cases, instructors predicted variability, but their justifications lacked the appropriate reasoning to support their predictions. This study has opened the gate and laid the groundwork for understanding conceptions of variation held by two-year college instructors. The results indicate that more in-depth investigation needs to take place if the goal is for students to develop a sophisticated conception of variation.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Along with a standards-based evaluation system, many local California districts are offering teachers on cycle and in good standing a choice-based method of evaluation. It is unclear what teachers' reactions to these systems have been, in particular, whether they feel the choice-based evaluation system allows for more meaningful feedback and insight into their strengths and areas of development as a professional educator. With the permission of the superintendent and a district assistant superintendent, five teachers were interviewed in a medium-sized suburban unified school district in California in order to gain a greater perspective into their opinions of the choice-based system of evaluation. With regards to types of evaluation experienced, two teachers emphasized three evaluation choices (peer, portfolio, and administrator) in their interviews; three others generally emphasized evaluation by an administrator. A district assistant superintendent was also interviewed, providing background about the choice-based teacher evaluation system in the district, as well as insight into the overarching practice and protocol of the choice-based system in this particular district. Findings highlighted similarities and differences across the cases. For example, teachers tended to agree that it was best to maintain a choice-based system versus the traditional administrative model. In addition, teachers understood and had a clear vision of the choice-based teacher evaluation process. At times, among teachers who did not select the peer or portfolio option themselves, they nonetheless stressed the advantages of those options. Teachers had varied ideas of what might be helpful in making teacher evaluations in general more effective. The educational landscape is changing and along with the changes is the reform and accountability system of teacher evaluations. As of late, teachers have come under scrutiny for their practice and professionalism in the classroom and many believe we need to hold teachers to higher standards. To that end, recent reforms have been put in place to allow for greater focus and accountability such as the development of new professional standards for teachers.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

The problem of this study was that research on teacher performance rewards in education is mixed, and throughout U.S. education history teacher rewards programs tend to be abandoned for a variety of failures. The purpose of this study was to explore teachers' perceptions of performance related pay (PRP), prior to local/state implementation of such plans, including their agreement/disagreement about various aspects and effects of these plans. Additionally, this research sought to determine if there were relationships among perceptions of PRP, teacher experience, and job satisfaction. Finally, the study sought to explore teachers' perceptions about acceptable alternatives to PRP plans. A random sample of teachers within four suburban Southern California K-12 schools was surveyed about their attitudes regarding PRP when performance is measured with two distinct models: a) teacher performance measured through student standardized test outcomes, and b) teacher performance measured through administrative evaluation. A small sample of respondents completed online surveys indicating attitudes related to aspects of each model and additional items regarding their level of job satisfaction. Data from these survey responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics and correlation coefficients examining relationships among teacher experience, job satisfaction, and perceptions of PRP. Lastly, open-ended comments captured several themes related to evaluation and alternatives to merit pay. In general, teachers did not agree that PRP would improve student learning or provide an incentive to work harder toward improving student achievement. However, there were some indications that the teachers surveyed in the current study may be open to PRP models or features not studied by this research. Teachers also expressed concerns about the fairness and complexity of teacher evaluations. The findings of this study suggest that PRP plans should be better aligned with school goals, and that teacher evaluation systems need to be re-evaluated before considering implementation of a PRP plan.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Additionally, the study sought to identify differences in perceived impact on site leadership capacity and teacher self-efficacy and job satisfaction. An exploratory comparative case study methodology was employed using an online survey and semi-structured interviews to collect and analyze data on eighteen variables. Two California unified school districts were compared based on differences in district-wide student improvement rates on annual testing. An exploratory factor analysis identified a set of empirically-based factors consisting of district-based initiative and actions, site-based instructional decision making and, site leadership associated with the survey providing an alternate perspective to organize data while offering an additional lens to consider the impact of the research-based factors. Total population and two within-group samples were compared between districts. Findings surfaced differences in perceptions and actions of district-wide staff associated with district vision, commitment and capacity building, data use, and site leadership variables. No differences were found in the presence of teacher self-efficacy and job satisfaction between the two districts. While limited in their generalizability, the results appear to point out the influence of a district instructional vision on district commitment, professional development, and site leadership.

Education, Joint Program Cal Poly SLO","Education, Joint Program Cal Poly SLO",John Yun,"The purpose of this study was to explore the perspectives of staff and faculty regarding factors affecting student success in distance learning at a California community college (CCC). Participants were members of the leadership group known as the distance learning committee. Data were collected through in-depth interviews using open-ended questions. Eight of 10 committee members volunteered to be interviewed for this study. This study identified four categories of factors affecting student success consistent with the literature: Organizational factors (campus and administrator support, user friendly course management systems, infrastructure), student internal factors (student initiative, familiarity with technology, motivation and competence), student external factors (family and work responsibilities), and pedagogical factors (course design, and course delivery). The literature on distance education primarily focuses on pedagogical factors and student internal and external factors affecting student success. Furthermore, the literature primarily addresses distance education programs. The CCCs in this study does not offer a certificate or degree completely through distance education, but does offer distance learning courses. This is a critical distinction to consider when examining distance learning courses at the CCCs. The majority of the participants interviewed focused on organizational and student internal factors affecting student success in distance learning. The majority also suggested providing faculty with training on course design and delivery. However, there was a difference of opinion on the implementation of that training. Staff members suggested that the training be mandatory, while faculty members suggested it be offered as opposed to mandatory. Additionally, participants stated that students could benefit from participating in a distance learning orientation to better prepare them prior to enrolling in distance learning courses. Finally, another critical observation was that faculty did not tend to focus on pedagogical factors affecting student success. These factors were prominent in the literature but not in the faculty responses.

It is unclear what teachers' reactions to these systems have been, in particular, whether they feel the choice-based evaluation system allows for more meaningful feedback and insight into their strengths and areas of development as a professional educator. With the permission of the superintendent and a district assistant superintendent, five teachers were interviewed in a medium-sized suburban unified school district in California in order to gain a greater perspective into their opinions of the choice-based system of evaluation. With regards to types of evaluation experienced, two teachers emphasized three evaluation choices (peer, portfolio, and administrator) in their interviews; three others generally emphasized evaluation by an administrator. A district assistant superintendent was also interviewed, providing background about the choice-based teacher evaluation system in the district, as well as insight into the overarching practice and protocol of the choice-based system in this particular district. Findings highlighted similarities and differences across the cases.

The problem of this study was that research on teacher performance rewards in education is mixed, and throughout U.S. education history teacher rewards programs tend to be abandoned for a variety of failures. The purpose of this study was to explore teachers' perceptions of performance related pay (PRP), prior to local/state implementation of such plans, including their agreement/disagreement about various aspects and effects of these plans. Additionally, this research sought to determine if there were relationships among perceptions of PRP, teacher experience, and job satisfaction. Finally, the study sought to explore teachers' perceptions about acceptable alternatives to PRP plans. A random sample of teachers within four suburban Southern California K-12 schools was surveyed about their attitudes regarding PRP when performance is measured with two distinct models: a) teacher performance measured through student standardized test outcomes, and b) teacher performance measured through administrative evaluation. A small sample of respondents completed online surveys indicating attitudes related to aspects of each model and additional items regarding their level of job satisfaction. Data from these survey responses were analyzed using descriptive statistics and correlation coefficients examining relationships among teacher experience, job satisfaction, and perceptions of PRP. Lastly, open-ended comments captured several themes related to evaluation and alternatives to merit pay. In general, teachers did not agree that PRP would improve student learning or provide an incentive to work harder toward improving student achievement. However, there were some indications that the teachers surveyed in the current study may be open to PRP models or features not studied by this research.

Electrical and Computer Engineering",Electrical and Computer Engineering,Bangalore S. Manjunath,"Advancements in sensing, processing, communications, and power technologies have enabled vast numbers of inexpensive wireless cameras that can observe a wide area. This dissertation addresses the challenges of designing a wide-area camera network and finding the spatial and temporal relationships between the cameras. In particular, we examine the challenges of calibrating non-overlapping cameras, aligning unsynchronized cameras with variable frame rates, and synchronizing cameras with variable frame rates. This research is largely motivated by the Scalable, Large Optical Sensor Network (SCALLOPSNet), a wide-area network deployed across the University of California, Santa Barbara. This dissertation describes the features of this network and the data that is used to validate our solutions. The first challenge is the 3D calibration of cameras with non-overlapping views. We propose to calibrate each camera in a global geographic coordinate system that is introduced by a mobile device, such as a smartphone. We formulate this geo-calibration as a maximum-likelihood estimation of the position and orientation of each camera given multimodal sensor measurements from a mobile device. The mobile devices record multiple images that overlap with the camera to be calibrated with its GPS location and 3D orientation. We show that this estimation can be solved using a consensus algorithm. The second challenge is the alignment of overlapping cameras that have unsynchronized start times and variable frame rates. We use the intersections of object trajectories as a reliable feature point that can be matched across views. The potential matching intersections are derived from matching trajectories. Trajectories are matched by, first, representing the spatial and temporal relationships between trajectories in a view in a Spatio-Temporal Context Graph and, then, matching these graphs across views. The final challenge is the synchronization of overlapping cameras with variable frame rates. Existing methods address cameras with fixed frame rates and known homographies. We formulate the problem mathematically to include variable frame rates, clock drift, and clock skew. The proposed solution is based on matching intersections of object trajectories. Addressing these challenges advances the state of the art in deploying wide-area camera networks. In particular, it enables the deployment of wireless cameras with non-overlapping views or unsynchronized frames.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

In particular, we examine the challenges of calibrating non-overlapping cameras, aligning unsynchronized cameras with variable frame rates, and synchronizing cameras with variable frame rates. This research is largely motivated by the Scalable, Large Optical Sensor Network (SCALLOPSNet), a wide-area network deployed across the University of California, Santa Barbara. This dissertation describes the features of this network and the data that is used to validate our solutions. The first challenge is the 3D calibration of cameras with non-overlapping views. We propose to calibrate each camera in a global geographic coordinate system that is introduced by a mobile device, such as a smartphone. We formulate this geo-calibration as a maximum-likelihood estimation of the position and orientation of each camera given multimodal sensor measurements from a mobile device. The mobile devices record multiple images that overlap with the camera to be calibrated with its GPS location and 3D orientation. We show that this estimation can be solved using a consensus algorithm. The second challenge is the alignment of overlapping cameras that have unsynchronized start times and variable frame rates. We use the intersections of object trajectories as a reliable feature point that can be matched across views. The potential matching intersections are derived from matching trajectories. Trajectories are matched by, first, representing the spatial and temporal relationships between trajectories in a view in a Spatio-Temporal Context Graph and, then, matching these graphs across views. The final challenge is the synchronization of overlapping cameras with variable frame rates. Existing methods address cameras with fixed frame rates and known homographies. We formulate the problem mathematically to include variable frame rates, clock drift, and clock skew. The proposed solution is based on matching intersections of object trajectories. Addressing these challenges advances the state of the art in deploying wide-area camera networks. In particular, it enables the deployment of wireless cameras with non-overlapping views or unsynchronized frames.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Environmental Science and Management",Environmental Science and Management,Christina Tague,"This dissertation improves the understanding of how accounting for fine-scale variability of topography and soil is important for modeling ecohydrologic responses to climate change and variability in California's Sierra Nevada watersheds. In the first chapter, I apply the Regional Hydrologic-Ecologic Simulation System (RHESSys) to eight small watersheds and investigate how the spatial resolution of digital elevation model (DEM) resolution affects the accuracy of modeling streamflow and model estimates of ecohydrologic responses to inter-annual climate variability. Modeled streamflow estimates become worse with DEM resolution coarser than 10m, the explanation lying in the corresponding reduction in the spatial variance of the wetness index. In the second chapter, I use Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) to investigate the effect of soil parameter uncertainty in modeling ecohydrologic estimates in the two small watersheds with different snow regimes. The predictive uncertainty of annual evapotranspiration and net primary production estimates for a transient snow watershed are larger than those for a snow-dominated watershed, but the predictive uncertainty in model estimates for daily streamflow is larger for the snow-dominated watershed. The effect of soil parameter uncertainty varies seasonally, between wet and dry years, and its effect on ecohydrologic estimates is often large relative to the effect of climate warming. In the third chapter, I investigate the different hydrologic responses to climate warming between a snow-dominated watershed and a transient snow watershed. The modeling results show that the snow-dominated watershed has greater sensitivity to climate warming than the transient snow watershed. In the both watersheds, leaf area index and wetness index are primary factors controlling spatial patterns of seasonal evapotranspiration under both of historical climate conditions and climate warming scenarios. Climate warming results in increased spatial variability in monthly evapotranspiration, especially in the summer period. In the last chapter, I develop a strategic sampling design for collecting soil moisture and sapflux data to capture watershed ecohydrologic responses to inter-annual climate variability in a transient snow watershed. The comparison of model-based calculated hydrological similarity indicators with measured values shows that spatial patterns of field-sampled soil moisture data are similar to those of model-based estimates. However, the model fails to capture the soil moisture and sapflux dynamics in the riparian zone site, and in a site where lateral subsurface flow may not follow surface topography. Future research will reduce these errors by the use of finer-scale representations of microclimate, topography, vegetation, and soil properties in the model.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Environmental Science and Management",Environmental Science and Management,John M. Melack,"As stream runoff increased, three agricultural watersheds showed nitrate dilution, two urban watersheds showed invariance, and one undeveloped watershed showed nitrate enrichment. The undeveloped upper mountainous watershed regions were dominant contributors of water and nitrate to stream runoff and nitrate across the whole watershed during periods of high runoff, such that the variability in stream nitrate concentrations during stormflow (rainstorms) was ~ 12% of the nitrate variability during baseflow (dry periods). In beach pore water, fresh groundwater with potentially elevated nitrate is largely precluded from discharge through beach sands by the dominant coastal bluff geomorphology of the region. However, tides circulate seawater into and out of beach sands, introducing marine particulate organic matter (POM), such as phytoplankton, giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera), and detrital material that is then degraded by heterotrophic microbes in beach sands to DOM and DIN. Nitrogen plays a dual role in coastal oceans. It sustains primary production, the foundation of coastal marine food webs, but can also cause degradation in the forms of eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, and hypoxia when supplied in excessive quantity from urban and agricultural land uses. In this dissertation, I examined the biogeochemical, land use, and hydrologic factors that regulate the concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in two nitrogen suppliers to the nearshore coastal ocean in the Santa Barbara, California region: watershed streams and beach pore water. In addition, I examined the influence of nearshore seawater and beach pore water dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition on the uptake of DIN by bacterioplankton, the primary decomposers in coastal oceans. I found that that the relationships between stream nitrate concentration and stream runoff were consistent within three broad land uses: agricultural, urban, and undeveloped. I used excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy, respiratory quotient determinations (i.e., ratio of CO2 production to O 2 consumption), and DIN concentration analysis in a 7-day time-series dark incubation to determine how variability in DOM composition in seawater and pore water influenced DIN uptake by bacterioplankton in nearshore seawater. I found that mixing of seawater and pore water promoted greater DIN uptake than occurred in pore water alone, which is likely the result of the presence of more labile seawater DOM and/or production of more labile DOM under seawater and pore water mixing. Together, the studies described herein enhance our understanding of nitrogen dynamics in coastal marine regions, and thus can enhance coastal zone management and development practices that seek to preserve the functioning of coastal marine ecosystems. I integrated pore water radon residence time distributions with DIN temporal evolution curves to calculate volume-weighted mean (VWM) DIN concentrations, which represented the DIN concentration of pore water discharging to the coastal ocean. I found that the combination of temporal variability in the residence time distribution due to spring-neap tidal cycles with the temporal evolution of DIN concentrations due to POM and DOM loading can result in substantial variability in pore water VWM DIN concentrations that should be accounted for in calculating DIN flux to coastal oceans. When pore water mixes with nearshore seawater upon discharge from the beach sands, DIN that was produced within beaches becomes available for uptake by bacterioplankton.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Environmental Science and Management",Environmental Science and Management,Hunter S. Lenihan,"Despite the importance of pathogens in natural populations, little attention has been given to host-pathogen dynamics in fisheries management. Here, I developed a fishery research program and designed a series of experiments and management models to evaluate the consequences of incorporating an explicit consideration of pathogens in the management of southern California abalone fisheries. A controlled, laboratory experiment was conducted testing the influence of environmental variables on key processes of withering syndrome (WS), a fatal disease of California abalones. Daily temperature variability associated with the intertidal environment increased the susceptibility of black abalone to infection, but disease expression occurred only at warm water temperatures and was independent of temperature variability. This result implies that high thermal variation of the marine intertidal zone allows WS to readily infect intertidal black abalone, but infected individuals remain asymptomatic until water temperatures periodically exceed thresholds modulating WS. Intertidal black abalone, but not other abalone species, went extinct locally throughout much of southern California following the emergence of WS, and results suggest that mass mortalities occur before pathogen transmission is limited by density-dependent factors. I analyzed a 30-year data set of abalone abundance at 33 sites in Channel Islands National Park to investigate whether the presence of multiple hosts of WS contributed to the decline of red abalone. The presence of multiple hosts was associated with red abalone declines at the Channel Islands and population declines were pronounced with increasing water temperature. I developed a deterministic, density-dependent host-pathogen model, parameterized by field surveys and laboratory investigations of red abalone life history, to address how the addition of a tolerant host modifies the impact of WS on red abalone. A reservoir host increases the severity of disease-induced population declines, and allows pathogens to overcome density thresholds for transmission, driving focal hosts to near extinction. In the case of red abalone, this will occur when water temperatures are warm and the rate of mortality from WS is high. A management strategy considering host-pathogen dynamics was developed for the California abalone fishery. I show that maximum sustainable yield is attained at a higher fishing effort and lower minimum size limit when disease processes are considered explicitly, and ignoring disease will underestimate potential yield available to the fishery. Including marine reserves as tool for managing diseased populations for harvest had mixed effects. Reserves protected against fishery collapse but increased host population densities within reserves maintained parasite transmission within the fished stock. I concluded by considering the special case where fisheries have prior knowledge of infection status allowing infected hosts to be targeted directly or culled. I found that supplementing harvest by targeting infected hosts directly can increase fishery yield and reduce parasite transmission, even when marine reserves are present. The results highlight how harvest strategies can be modified to consider disease processes explicitly and underscore the value of understanding the indirect consequences of fishing in the integrated management of marine resources.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

We find that a TURF system's performance depends upon the degree of revenue sharing among fishermen.

Consumed through competitive effort and difficult to exclude from uncoordinated users, common-pool resources are susceptible to over-extraction and create incentives for users to ignore the social costs of their extraction decisions. The common-pool resource literature in recent decades has examined the first-order conditions necessary for institutions to emerge to solve the problems of competitive resource extraction and collective action management. This dissertation advances our understanding of the emergence of common-pool resource management by empirically addressing the factors influencing the decision to develop institutions to address collective action problems. The setting to test the determinants of common-pool resource management comprises the groundwater basins of California. Groundwater basins in the state have competing users, which include urban, agricultural, and environmental constituents. In a semi-arid climate with limited surface water supplies and increasing demand for water resources, basins in California are susceptible to common-pool problems, including overdraft, seawater intrusion, and land subsidence. Unlike most states in the western United States, California does not proactively manage groundwater basins at the state level to address localized common-pool groundwater problems. Instead, local agencies and individual users are left with the choice of whether to collectively bargain and develop the institutional rules for groundwater basin management. This dissertation answers three questions regarding common-pool resource governance that are raised in the California groundwater management example. First, what are the determining factors in the emergence of groundwater management institutions? This research finds that groundwater institutions emerge where common-pool problems are severe and the benefits outweigh the transaction costs of forming and maintaining these institutions. Second, given that local agencies and groundwater users collectively act to manage a groundwater basin, what institutions and formal rules will they adopt? This research finds that pumping restrictions, taxes, and adjudicated property rights are likely in groundwater basins where municipal water supply is the dominant water use, persistent overdraft is an issue, and seawater intrusion is a concern. Finally, negotiations for establishing private property rights to groundwater are examined in California's adjudicated groundwater basins. An analytical framework is developed to test the importance of the concentration of groundwater use, heterogeneity of users, and aggregate number of users in avoiding costly litigation and reaching voluntary agreements in the shadow of the courts. The factors affecting contracting success are ambiguous. This result is explained, however, by legal uncertainty in the state's water rights doctrines.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Environmental Science and Management",Environmental Science and Management,Hunter S. Lenihan,"This dissertation describes collaborative fisheries research (CFR) on California spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus) at the Santa Barbara Channel Islands (SBCI). The research goals addressed in this work include: (1) establishing a collaborative approach to gathering fisheries data for assessments and management; (2) assessment of marine reserves at SBCI; (3) estimating mortality rates of lobsters populations throughout the SBCI marine reserve network; and (4) construction of fisheries models that provide context for interpreting mortality rates I estimated. CFR enhanced assessment of marine reserves established in 2003 at the SBCI in terms of their impact in P. interruptus population structure and fishery interactions. After six years of reserve protection, there was a four to eight-fold increase in trap yield, a 5 -- 10% increase in the mean size (carapace length) of legal sized lobsters, and larger size structure of lobsters trapped inside versus outside of three replicate reserves. Patterns in trap data were corroborated by visual SCUBA surveys that indicated a four to six-fold increases in lobster density inside reserves. These results indicate that marine reserves have strong conservation benefits for P. interruptus. Inside reserves, trap performance (the number and mean size of legal-sized lobsters caught in traps) was significantly influenced by proximity to reserve borders, a pattern that suggests net emigration of lobster from inside reserves to adjacent fished areas (spillover). Interestingly, spillover was not apparent in trap yields or commercial fishery effort distribution outside reserves, nor was it apparent in tagging studies. This suggests that spillover from reserves may have little influence of fishery yield outside reserves. However, yield due to spillover might increase as the reserves age and lobster biomass continues to increase inside reserves. Mean total mortality (Z) of female lobsters was lower at sites inside reserves (Z = 0.21 [+/-0.07 SE]) than at sites outside reserves (Z = 0.59 [+/-0.02 SE]). Mean mortality at all sites inside reserves, and among sites near reserve centers (where Z = 0.17 [+/-0.05 SE]), was similar to estimates of natural mortality for other temperate spiny lobster species. Among sites inside reserves, there was a positive relationship between mortality and proximity to reserve borders, but this relationship was absent among sites outside reserves. Mortality estimates were much more variable among sites inside reserves than at sites in fished areas. Results of YPR models suggest that increased effort in this fishery will not result in commensurate increases in yield. However, current spawning potential at SBCI is _20% (of virgin conditions), and this could decrease with increased effort. Our collaborative framework provides a stable and inclusive framework for conducting future research that informs management of this fishery and fosters stakeholder support.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Environmental Science and Management",Environmental Science and Management,Jeff Dozier,"Nonpersistent snow crystals are deposited during storms, last for a few days, and are common fracture planes in avalanches. Because avalanches on persistent crystals cause more deaths, avalanches on nonpersistent crystals receive less study despite being responsible for the majority of avalanche fatalities in some U.S. states such as California. Avalanches are studied here using thousands of avalanche control records, dozens of crown face profiles, and field work with near-infrared (nIR) imaging and particle tracking. New (24-hr) snow and Extended Column Test propagation (ECTP) are the best predictors of avalanche activity on nonpersistent crystals, while changes in temperature and density during storms have no effect. Failure planes with nonpersistent crystals are the same hardness as layers immediately above, but are significantly softer than layers immediately below. In one nIR profile, nonpersistent crystals form a thin weak layer, but in others, there is no grain size difference between the fracture plane and adjacent strata. Lack of a weak layer makes fracture in nonpersistent crystals similar to other materials; fractures cut through the bulk without any specific weakness other than a flaw. Failures in nonpersistent crystals follow behavior predicted by the anticrack model, a model emphasizing collapse that has only been tested on failures of persistent crystals. This suggests nonpersistent and persistent crystals share the same failure mechanism. Critical cut lengths during Propagation Saw Tests (PSTs) vary little with slope angle, consistent with anticrack predictions. A PST on nonpersistent crystals collapsed about 1 mm, half the collapse of a PST on persistent crystals. Easily collapsible planar crystals such as sectored plates and stellars are the most common nonpersistent crystals in failure planes. During high instability, fractures are easier to trigger on nonpersistent than on persistent crystals. Sustainability of propagation depends on new snow depth because the slab must withstand bending; otherwise tensile slab fracture occurs. Measurement of displacement during PSTs yield some of the lowest elastic moduli recorded for snow: 0.04-0.41 MPa for slabs with densities from 73-143 kg m-3. The median fracture energy for nonpersistent crystals is 0.09 J m-2, comparable to published values for persistent crystals.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Environmental Science and Management",Environmental Science and Management,Christina Tague,"This dissertation improves the understanding of how accounting for fine-scale variability of topography and soil is important for modeling ecohydrologic responses to climate change and variability in California's Sierra Nevada watersheds. In the first chapter, I apply the Regional Hydrologic-Ecologic Simulation System (RHESSys) to eight small watersheds and investigate how the spatial resolution of digital elevation model (DEM) resolution affects the accuracy of modeling streamflow and model estimates of ecohydrologic responses to inter-annual climate variability. Modeled streamflow estimates become worse with DEM resolution coarser than 10m, the explanation lying in the corresponding reduction in the spatial variance of the wetness index. In the second chapter, I use Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) to investigate the effect of soil parameter uncertainty in modeling ecohydrologic estimates in the two small watersheds with different snow regimes. The predictive uncertainty of annual evapotranspiration and net primary production estimates for a transient snow watershed are larger than those for a snow-dominated watershed, but the predictive uncertainty in model estimates for daily streamflow is larger for the snow-dominated watershed. The effect of soil parameter uncertainty varies seasonally, between wet and dry years, and its effect on ecohydrologic estimates is often large relative to the effect of climate warming. In the third chapter, I investigate the different hydrologic responses to climate warming between a snow-dominated watershed and a transient snow watershed. The modeling results show that the snow-dominated watershed has greater sensitivity to climate warming than the transient snow watershed. In the both watersheds, leaf area index and wetness index are primary factors controlling spatial patterns of seasonal evapotranspiration under both of historical climate conditions and climate warming scenarios. Climate warming results in increased spatial variability in monthly evapotranspiration, especially in the summer period. In the last chapter, I develop a strategic sampling design for collecting soil moisture and sapflux data to capture watershed ecohydrologic responses to inter-annual climate variability in a transient snow watershed. The comparison of model-based calculated hydrological similarity indicators with measured values shows that spatial patterns of field-sampled soil moisture data are similar to those of model-based estimates. However, the model fails to capture the soil moisture and sapflux dynamics in the riparian zone site, and in a site where lateral subsurface flow may not follow surface topography. Future research will reduce these errors by the use of finer-scale representations of microclimate, topography, vegetation, and soil properties in the model.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Environmental Science and Management",Environmental Science and Management,John M. Melack,"As stream runoff increased, three agricultural watersheds showed nitrate dilution, two urban watersheds showed invariance, and one undeveloped watershed showed nitrate enrichment. The undeveloped upper mountainous watershed regions were dominant contributors of water and nitrate to stream runoff and nitrate across the whole watershed during periods of high runoff, such that the variability in stream nitrate concentrations during stormflow (rainstorms) was ~ 12% of the nitrate variability during baseflow (dry periods). In beach pore water, fresh groundwater with potentially elevated nitrate is largely precluded from discharge through beach sands by the dominant coastal bluff geomorphology of the region. However, tides circulate seawater into and out of beach sands, introducing marine particulate organic matter (POM), such as phytoplankton, giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera), and detrital material that is then degraded by heterotrophic microbes in beach sands to DOM and DIN. Nitrogen plays a dual role in coastal oceans. It sustains primary production, the foundation of coastal marine food webs, but can also cause degradation in the forms of eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, and hypoxia when supplied in excessive quantity from urban and agricultural land uses. In this dissertation, I examined the biogeochemical, land use, and hydrologic factors that regulate the concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in two nitrogen suppliers to the nearshore coastal ocean in the Santa Barbara, California region: watershed streams and beach pore water. In addition, I examined the influence of nearshore seawater and beach pore water dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition on the uptake of DIN by bacterioplankton, the primary decomposers in coastal oceans. I found that that the relationships between stream nitrate concentration and stream runoff were consistent within three broad land uses: agricultural, urban, and undeveloped. I used excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy, respiratory quotient determinations (i.e., ratio of CO2 production to O 2 consumption), and DIN concentration analysis in a 7-day time-series dark incubation to determine how variability in DOM composition in seawater and pore water influenced DIN uptake by bacterioplankton in nearshore seawater. I found that mixing of seawater and pore water promoted greater DIN uptake than occurred in pore water alone, which is likely the result of the presence of more labile seawater DOM and/or production of more labile DOM under seawater and pore water mixing. Together, the studies described herein enhance our understanding of nitrogen dynamics in coastal marine regions, and thus can enhance coastal zone management and development practices that seek to preserve the functioning of coastal marine ecosystems. I integrated pore water radon residence time distributions with DIN temporal evolution curves to calculate volume-weighted mean (VWM) DIN concentrations, which represented the DIN concentration of pore water discharging to the coastal ocean. I found that the combination of temporal variability in the residence time distribution due to spring-neap tidal cycles with the temporal evolution of DIN concentrations due to POM and DOM loading can result in substantial variability in pore water VWM DIN concentrations that should be accounted for in calculating DIN flux to coastal oceans. When pore water mixes with nearshore seawater upon discharge from the beach sands, DIN that was produced within beaches becomes available for uptake by bacterioplankton.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Environmental Science and Management",Environmental Science and Management,Hunter S. Lenihan,"Despite the importance of pathogens in natural populations, little attention has been given to host-pathogen dynamics in fisheries management. Here, I developed a fishery research program and designed a series of experiments and management models to evaluate the consequences of incorporating an explicit consideration of pathogens in the management of southern California abalone fisheries. A controlled, laboratory experiment was conducted testing the influence of environmental variables on key processes of withering syndrome (WS), a fatal disease of California abalones. Daily temperature variability associated with the intertidal environment increased the susceptibility of black abalone to infection, but disease expression occurred only at warm water temperatures and was independent of temperature variability. This result implies that high thermal variation of the marine intertidal zone allows WS to readily infect intertidal black abalone, but infected individuals remain asymptomatic until water temperatures periodically exceed thresholds modulating WS. Intertidal black abalone, but not other abalone species, went extinct locally throughout much of southern California following the emergence of WS, and results suggest that mass mortalities occur before pathogen transmission is limited by density-dependent factors. I analyzed a 30-year data set of abalone abundance at 33 sites in Channel Islands National Park to investigate whether the presence of multiple hosts of WS contributed to the decline of red abalone. The presence of multiple hosts was associated with red abalone declines at the Channel Islands and population declines were pronounced with increasing water temperature. I developed a deterministic, density-dependent host-pathogen model, parameterized by field surveys and laboratory investigations of red abalone life history, to address how the addition of a tolerant host modifies the impact of WS on red abalone. A reservoir host increases the severity of disease-induced population declines, and allows pathogens to overcome density thresholds for transmission, driving focal hosts to near extinction. In the case of red abalone, this will occur when water temperatures are warm and the rate of mortality from WS is high. A management strategy considering host-pathogen dynamics was developed for the California abalone fishery. I show that maximum sustainable yield is attained at a higher fishing effort and lower minimum size limit when disease processes are considered explicitly, and ignoring disease will underestimate potential yield available to the fishery. Including marine reserves as tool for managing diseased populations for harvest had mixed effects. Reserves protected against fishery collapse but increased host population densities within reserves maintained parasite transmission within the fished stock. I concluded by considering the special case where fisheries have prior knowledge of infection status allowing infected hosts to be targeted directly or culled. I found that supplementing harvest by targeting infected hosts directly can increase fishery yield and reduce parasite transmission, even when marine reserves are present. The results highlight how harvest strategies can be modified to consider disease processes explicitly and underscore the value of understanding the indirect consequences of fishing in the integrated management of marine resources.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Environmental Science and Management",Environmental Science and Management,Steven D. Gaines,"This dissertation considers how law, ecology, and economics interface in the context of rights-based fishery management. The findings are presented in three chapters, each structured as an independent journal article. Each chapter begins with a general overview of the ecological and economic incentives for rights-based fishery management, followed by an in-depth discussion of the particular approach under consideration. Chapter one focuses on ""territorial use rights in fisheries"" (TURFs), a spatial, property rights-based fishery management technique. I analyze the viability of instituting TURFs in California state waters under existing law, including the Marine Life Protection Act and the Marine Life Management Act. I conclude that while the policy rationales undergirding existing law and regulation support the idea of TURF management, they do not expressly provide for TURF implementation. Given that California lacks TURF-specific policy, I consider in chapter two what such a policy might look like and what the effects of that policy might be. To address these questions, my collaborators and I developed an ecosystem service tradeoff analysis model for the southern California red sea urchin fishery. Our model compares the tradeoffs between fish biomass and fishery profit under four management regimes: a fleet model, a TURF system without revenue sharing, a TURF with revenue sharing, and optimal spatial management. We find that a TURF system's performance depends upon the degree of revenue sharing among fishermen. Our goal in this chapter is not to identify the ""best"" management option for this fishery; rather, we seek to introduce ecosystem service tradeoff analysis to a new audience---the law and policy community---and demonstrate how this tool can help decision-makers gauge the costs and benefits of various regulatory regimes. The third chapter considers how antitrust law affects the formation and operation of fishery cooperatives. I conducted a synthetic literature review of past research, new case law, and emerging statutory guidance. I conclude that antitrust law continues to exert a chilling effect on fishery cooperatives. Most problematic from both conservation and economic standpoints is the constraint antitrust law places on a cooperative's ability to voluntarily restrict harvest below a governmentally-defined total allowable catch.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Environmental Science and Management",Environmental Science and Management,Gary Libecap,"Common-pool resources exhibit characteristics of both private and public goods. Consumed through competitive effort and difficult to exclude from uncoordinated users, common-pool resources are susceptible to over-extraction and create incentives for users to ignore the social costs of their extraction decisions. The common-pool resource literature in recent decades has examined the first-order conditions necessary for institutions to emerge to solve the problems of competitive resource extraction and collective action management. This dissertation advances our understanding of the emergence of common-pool resource management by empirically addressing the factors influencing the decision to develop institutions to address collective action problems. The setting to test the determinants of common-pool resource management comprises the groundwater basins of California. Groundwater basins in the state have competing users, which include urban, agricultural, and environmental constituents. In a semi-arid climate with limited surface water supplies and increasing demand for water resources, basins in California are susceptible to common-pool problems, including overdraft, seawater intrusion, and land subsidence. Unlike most states in the western United States, California does not proactively manage groundwater basins at the state level to address localized common-pool groundwater problems. Instead, local agencies and individual users are left with the choice of whether to collectively bargain and develop the institutional rules for groundwater basin management. This dissertation answers three questions regarding common-pool resource governance that are raised in the California groundwater management example. First, what are the determining factors in the emergence of groundwater management institutions? This research finds that groundwater institutions emerge where common-pool problems are severe and the benefits outweigh the transaction costs of forming and maintaining these institutions. Second, given that local agencies and groundwater users collectively act to manage a groundwater basin, what institutions and formal rules will they adopt? This research finds that pumping restrictions, taxes, and adjudicated property rights are likely in groundwater basins where municipal water supply is the dominant water use, persistent overdraft is an issue, and seawater intrusion is a concern. Finally, negotiations for establishing private property rights to groundwater are examined in California's adjudicated groundwater basins. An analytical framework is developed to test the importance of the concentration of groundwater use, heterogeneity of users, and aggregate number of users in avoiding costly litigation and reaching voluntary agreements in the shadow of the courts. The factors affecting contracting success are ambiguous. This result is explained, however, by legal uncertainty in the state's water rights doctrines.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Environmental Science and Management",Environmental Science and Management,Jeff Dozier,"Nonpersistent snow crystals are deposited during storms, last for a few days, and are common fracture planes in avalanches. Because avalanches on persistent crystals cause more deaths, avalanches on nonpersistent crystals receive less study despite being responsible for the majority of avalanche fatalities in some U.S. states such as California. Avalanches are studied here using thousands of avalanche control records, dozens of crown face profiles, and field work with near-infrared (nIR) imaging and particle tracking. New (24-hr) snow and Extended Column Test propagation (ECTP) are the best predictors of avalanche activity on nonpersistent crystals, while changes in temperature and density during storms have no effect. Failure planes with nonpersistent crystals are the same hardness as layers immediately above, but are significantly softer than layers immediately below. In one nIR profile, nonpersistent crystals form a thin weak layer, but in others, there is no grain size difference between the fracture plane and adjacent strata. Lack of a weak layer makes fracture in nonpersistent crystals similar to other materials; fractures cut through the bulk without any specific weakness other than a flaw. Failures in nonpersistent crystals follow behavior predicted by the anticrack model, a model emphasizing collapse that has only been tested on failures of persistent crystals. This suggests nonpersistent and persistent crystals share the same failure mechanism. Critical cut lengths during Propagation Saw Tests (PSTs) vary little with slope angle, consistent with anticrack predictions. A PST on nonpersistent crystals collapsed about 1 mm, half the collapse of a PST on persistent crystals. Easily collapsible planar crystals such as sectored plates and stellars are the most common nonpersistent crystals in failure planes. During high instability, fractures are easier to trigger on nonpersistent than on persistent crystals. Sustainability of propagation depends on new snow depth because the slab must withstand bending; otherwise tensile slab fracture occurs. Measurement of displacement during PSTs yield some of the lowest elastic moduli recorded for snow: 0.04-0.41 MPa for slabs with densities from 73-143 kg m-3. The median fracture energy for nonpersistent crystals is 0.09 J m-2, comparable to published values for persistent crystals.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Environmental Science and Management",Environmental Science and Management,Hunter S. Lenihan,"This dissertation describes collaborative fisheries research (CFR) on California spiny lobster (Panulirus interruptus) at the Santa Barbara Channel Islands (SBCI). The research goals addressed in this work include: (1) establishing a collaborative approach to gathering fisheries data for assessments and management; (2) assessment of marine reserves at SBCI; (3) estimating mortality rates of lobsters populations throughout the SBCI marine reserve network; and (4) construction of fisheries models that provide context for interpreting mortality rates I estimated. CFR enhanced assessment of marine reserves established in 2003 at the SBCI in terms of their impact in P. interruptus population structure and fishery interactions. After six years of reserve protection, there was a four to eight-fold increase in trap yield, a 5 -- 10% increase in the mean size (carapace length) of legal sized lobsters, and larger size structure of lobsters trapped inside versus outside of three replicate reserves. Patterns in trap data were corroborated by visual SCUBA surveys that indicated a four to six-fold increases in lobster density inside reserves. These results indicate that marine reserves have strong conservation benefits for P. interruptus. Inside reserves, trap performance (the number and mean size of legal-sized lobsters caught in traps) was significantly influenced by proximity to reserve borders, a pattern that suggests net emigration of lobster from inside reserves to adjacent fished areas (spillover). Interestingly, spillover was not apparent in trap yields or commercial fishery effort distribution outside reserves, nor was it apparent in tagging studies. This suggests that spillover from reserves may have little influence of fishery yield outside reserves. However, yield due to spillover might increase as the reserves age and lobster biomass continues to increase inside reserves. Mean total mortality (Z) of female lobsters was lower at sites inside reserves (Z = 0.21 [+/-0.07 SE]) than at sites outside reserves (Z = 0.59 [+/-0.02 SE]). Mean mortality at all sites inside reserves, and among sites near reserve centers (where Z = 0.17 [+/-0.05 SE]), was similar to estimates of natural mortality for other temperate spiny lobster species. Among sites inside reserves, there was a positive relationship between mortality and proximity to reserve borders, but this relationship was absent among sites outside reserves. Mortality estimates were much more variable among sites inside reserves than at sites in fished areas. Results of YPR models suggest that increased effort in this fishery will not result in commensurate increases in yield. However, current spawning potential at SBCI is _20% (of virgin conditions), and this could decrease with increased effort. Our collaborative framework provides a stable and inclusive framework for conducting future research that informs management of this fishery and fosters stakeholder support.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Geography",Geography,Jennifer Y. King,"First, I evaluated how photodegradation by ultraviolet (UV) radiation affected litter decomposition for two litter positions in a field experiment at Sedgwick Reserve in California. I found that photodegradation increased litter mass loss by up to 30% at positions with and without radiation exposure, suggesting UV radiation had both direct and indirect contributions to litter decay. Next, effects of UV photodegradation on litter biodegradability were examined in a laboratory experiment. Surprisingly, UV radiation in summer reduced litter biodegradability by 28% through reduction of litter N availability. This result suggests that UV radiation has both positive and negative impacts on microbial decomposition of litter. Finally, I examined impacts of UV radiation on litter chemical composition at a molecular level using two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D NMR) spectroscopy. Although conventional fiber analysis showed no changes in lignin concentration, 2D NMR spectroscopy data revealed that UV radiation degraded lignin p-hydroxyphenyl units and lignin beta-aryl linkages. Furthermore, lignin degradation likely led to loss of hemicellulose through enhancing microbial decomposition. Plant litter decomposition is a fundamental ecosystem service because it regulates soil fertility, the turnover and fate of carbon and nutrients, and ultimately plant growth and productivity. Photodegradation recently has been proposed as a significant driver of litter decomposition in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. However, the mechanisms through which photodegradation contributes to litter decomposition remain poorly understood. In this dissertation, I conducted both field and laboratory experiments to test the hypothesis that photodegradation has both direct (through abiotic photochemical reactions) and indirect (through interacting with microbial decomposition) contributions to litter decomposition. The combined results demonstrate that photodegradation is an important contributor to litter decomposition processes in arid ecosystems like California grasslands. More importantly, my work suggests that photodegradation is not purely an abiotic process, as it has significant indirect contributions to litter decay through effects on microbial decomposition. Thus future empirical and modeling studies of litter decomposition must examine the interaction of abiotic and biotic processes in arid ecosystems. This work identifies major pathways through which photodegradation increases microbial decomposition of litter. It also advances our understanding of chemical mechanisms underlying photodegradation.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

In this research, I examine patterns of biomass accumulation in southern California chaparral shrublands at early and late stages of post-fire recovery using a combination of detailed field work and remote sensing. Using field measurements of a site with adjacent stands of varying ages and high spatial resolution imagery, I examine patterns of species composition and associated levels of biomass to characterize long-term patterns in biomass accumulation. I also evaluate the potential for utilizing shrub growth ring widths to track annual biomass accumulation in the first decade of post-fire recovery, and test for the relationship between biomass and spatial variation in factors related to the energy and water balance. In addition, I examine the potential for extending the use of shrub growth rings to track biomass across larger spatial extents using satellite-based growth metrics. The study of stands of varying ages reveals that biomass shows substantial variation even within stands of the same age, and that species composition is different in younger stands of chaparral compared to the more mature stands. In the study of growth rings, I find that while measuring growth rings widths is a valuable method for tracking biomass accumulation in the first decade following a fire, there is no apparent relationship between biomass and factors related to the energy and water balance. Annual biomass growth, as estimated from shrub growth ring widths, shows a promising relationship with satellite-based metrics of annual growth, indicating the potential for further study of the relationship over larger spatial extents.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Geography",Geography,Dar A. Roberts,"Urban trees are strategically important in a city's effort to mitigate their carbon footprint, heat island effects, air pollution, and stormwater runoff. Currently, the most common method for quantifying urban forest structure and ecosystem function is through field plot sampling. However, taking intensive structural measurements on private properties throughout a city is difficult, and the outputs from sample inventories are not spatially explicit. The overarching goal of this dissertation is to develop methods for mapping urban forest structure and function using fused hyperspectral imagery and waveform lidar data at the individual tree crown scale. Urban forest ecosystem services estimated using the USDA Forest Service's i-Tree Eco (formerly UFORE) model are based largely on tree species and leaf area index (LAI). Accordingly, tree species were mapped in my Santa Barbara, California study area for 29 species comprising >80% of canopy. Crown-scale discriminant analysis methods were introduced for fusing Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometry (AVIRIS) data with a suite of lidar structural metrics (e.g., tree height, crown porosity) to maximize classification accuracy in a complex environment. AVIRIS imagery was critical to achieving an overall species-level accuracy of 83.4% while lidar data was most useful for improving the discrimination of small and morphologically unique species. LAI was estimated at both the field-plot scale using laser penetration metrics and at the crown scale using allometry. Agreement of the former with photographic estimates of gap fraction and the latter with allometric estimates based on field measurements was examined. Results indicate that lidar may be used reasonably to measure LAI in an urban environment lacking in continuous canopy and characterized by high species diversity. Finally, urban ecosystem services such as carbon storage and building energy-use modification were analyzed through combination of aforementioned methods and the i-Tree Eco modeling framework.

Geography",Geography,David Lopez-Carr,"This dissertation develops and evaluates a vulnerability assessment termed the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI). The LVI estimates the relative ability of California commercial sea urchin fishermen to cope with the change associated with proposed marine protected areas (MPAs). A key goal in establishing MPAs is to minimize the potential negative impacts and maximize conservation benefits to local fishing communities. However, current efforts to assess the impact of proposed MPAs upon fisherman livelihoods largely assume a linear relationship between percent of fishing area or revenue lost and magnitude of impact to fishermen and do not consider the differential abilities of fishermen to cope with change. The three manuscripts included in this dissertation develop the vulnerability assessment framework and methodology (Livelihood Vulnerability Index), implement and evaluate the vulnerability assessment across multiple scales, and explore how vulnerability assessment scores may be used to spatially weight and thus better represent the importance of fishing areas in marine spatial planning. The major contribution of this research is the operationalization of a method to systematically assess the vulnerability of fisherman livelihoods---an understudied population group. In applying this vulnerability assessment methodology I found that: 1) the historical and current socioeconomic, environmental, and regulatory conditions fishermen experience in a given place predicted vulnerability levels; 2) the use of weights applied to vulnerability measures within the vulnerability assessments did not significantly impact vulnerability scores and rankings; and 3) fisherman perceptions of what factors may be important to measure vulnerability levels may not coincide with the best predictors of vulnerability levels. Furthermore, in applying the vulnerability assessment output (LVI scores) to spatial fishing data I found that: 1) the use of spatial data weights may be negligible if spatial data across fishermen are highly clustered as observed in spatial fishing patterns; 2) it is important to consider the scale of analyses since analyzing data at coarser resolutions may exclude the importance of fishing grounds from smaller ports or underrepresented fishermen groups ; and 3) to suitably address the issue of scale, data aggregation techniques may be usefully applied to better represent the importance of fishing areas from underrepresented fishermen groups.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Geography",Geography,Oliver A. Chadwick,"Understanding the distribution of plant productivity is vital for understanding the spatial variability of ecosystem functions. This study evaluates microtopographic controls (1m-12m) on plant productivity on three rolling hills in Sedgwick Natural Reserve, located in south-central California. Specifically I evaluate the relationship between topographic metrics and plant biomass production through space and time. Biomass was measured using destructive harvests and seasonal Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data. Eighty-three 1x0.5m2 quadrats of aboveground plant matter at peak biomass (ANPP) were harvested for the 2012 growing season. For the 2009 growing season, AVIRIS derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to estimate biomass at roughly monthly intervals from March to August. I evaluate whether seasonal changes in growing degree days (GDD) was a better predictor of plant phenological events than cumulative days since first soil moisture increase. To characterize topography, I used a 1m resolution digital elevation model derived from terrestrial lidar data to calculate curvature, aspect, and the Compound Topographic Index (CTI) - an index that integrates the flow accumulation area and slope. Using GDD, I found that ecosystem productivity was not temperature limited early in the growing season. Using webcam images I was able to remotely monitor phenological events quantitatively, but was not able to calculate NDVI because I lacked appropriate spectral bands. Plants growing on north facing slopes consistently had higher ANPP than those on south facing slopes, due to lower temperatures, hence greater preservation of soil moisture. No correlation was found between CTI or curvature and ANPP across the 83 sampled points in 2012, potentially because it was a dry year and there was limited water redistribution to lower positions in the landscape. Although a relationship between topography and soil moisture is probably valid for humid areas, it is subject to considerable variability in semiarid grasslands because during low rainfall years, evapotranspiration consumes much of the moisture that could be available for downslope movement. In these settings it is important to consider the amount and duration of water input as well as soil properties in understanding the distribution of soil moisture as it might influence plant productivity.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Geography",Geography,Naomi L. Tague,"This dissertation explores ecohydrologic interactions in western U.S. catchments using a process-based model. My research focuses on understanding how model estimates of two key components of the hydrologic budget, evapotranspiration and streamflow, are influenced by soil and vegetation physiological characteristics in three watersheds. These watersheds are located in the Oregon Cascades, California Sierra Nevada, and Colorado Rocky Mountains. Water availability in these systems is driven on a first order by annual precipitation. The majority of their precipitation is received in the winter and their forests are generally water-limited in the summer. However, they differ in the magnitude of annual precipitation received, the fraction of winter precipitation received as snow, and their seasonal energy demands. The response of these ecosystems to inter-annual climate variation is also a function of soil storage and ecophysiological characteristics. I will present research motivated by three research questions. How do soil characteristics and climate interact to influence forest water availability? How do uncertainties in forest ecophysiology, carbon allocation strategy, and their interaction effect mature forest carbon and streamflow estimates? Finally, how do climate and carbon allocation strategy influence the rate of forest growth and streamflow recovery following disturbance? I use a physically-based model, the Regional Hydro-Ecologic Simulation System, to address these questions. Results indicate that the influence of soil storage on evapotranspiration's sensitivity to climate drivers varies across sites. In the Sierra Nevada and Cascades, low soil storage increases the sensitivity of annual ET to climate drivers. Evapotranspiration in Colorado, which is water-limited but has a summer monsoonal pulse, is not sensitive to changes in soil storage. Estimates of forest carbon sequestration differ significantly between three carbon allocation strategies in mature (100-300) forests. Biomass estimates for leaf and fine root pools were strongly sensitive to allocation strategy and ecophysiological characteristics in the Sierra Nevada watershed. Streamflow estimates in this drier watershed are also more sensitive to vegetation ecophysiology. I show that the effect of allocation strategy effects estimates of recovery in forest LAI and streamflow more than climate variability at al three sites.

Although CH4 plume mapping did not motivate the NASA Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) design and municipal air quality monitoring stations were not intended for studying marine geological seepage, these assets have capabilities that can make them viable for studying concentrated (high flux, highly heterogeneous) CH4 sources, such as the Coal Oil Point (COP) seep field (_0.015 Tg CH4 yr-1) offshore Santa Barbara, California. Hourly total hydrocarbon (THC) data, spanning 1990 to 2008 from an air pollution station located near COP, were analyzed and showed geologic CH4 emissions as the dominant local source. A band ratio approach was developed and applied to high glint AVIRIS data over COP, resulting in local-scale mapping of natural atmospheric CH4 plumes. A Cluster-Tuned Matched Filter (CTMF) technique was applied to Gulf of Mexico AVIRIS data to detect CH4 venting from offshore platforms. Review of 744 platform-centered CTMF subsets was facilitated through a flexible PHP-based web portal.

The variations of precipitation extremes are particularly important in southern California with its pronounced seasonal rainfall regime and landscape that is prone to fire events. The historical variability of precipitation in Santa Barbara County is examined on varying timescales and then compared to several phenomena believed to control precipitation in the region. Hourly precipitation data are gathered from seven local stations covering roughly the past forty years (1970--2010). The climatology of precipitation in the region including intensity and persistences of storm episodes is examined. The patterns and variations of precipitations are then compared to three main teleconnection phenomena: the El Nino Southern Oscillation, the Madden-Julian Oscillation, and atmospheric rivers. The underlying goal of this research is to gain a comprehensive understanding of precipitation climatology in the region and the features that influence control over it.

Geography",Geography,"Christopher J. Still, Leila MV Carvalho","The presence of low-lying stratocumulus clouds and fog has been known to modify biophysical and ecological properties in a variety of ecosystems in different climates. This is especially true for California's Channel Islands, where forests are frequently shaded by low-lying clouds or immersed in fog during warm and dry summer months. Previous studies suggest that clouds strongly modulate forest distributions as well as carbon and water budgets in these semi-arid environments by reducing solar insolation and raising relative humidity and thus reducing evapotranspiration, while also potentially supplying water directly to the landscape from fog-drip. While summertime fog and stratus cover in California's Channel Islands can ameliorate summer drought stress and enhance soil water budgets, they often have different spatial and temporal patterns. These differing patterns and the resulting shifts in relative ecological importance of fog and stratus are understudied. The overall objective of this study is to map spatial and temporal distributions of daytime cloud cover frequency for the California Channel Islands, and to predict probabilities of surface cloud (fog) contact and immersion for these islands.

Geography",Geography,Oliver A. Chadwick,"Global anthropogenic desiccation of lake basins in arid and semi-arid areas result in substantial increases in the flux of aeolian material. In California, Owens Lake playa has produced a tremendous amount of windblown dust since its desiccation in the early 20th century. In view of the potential danger to human health of the dust blowing off the playa, the chemistry and mineralogy of playa sediments and dust are well known. By contrast, the impact of the dust on surrounding soils and ecosystems in Owens Valley has been less well studied. This dissertation documents the accumulation of dust-derived salts from Owens Lake playa in nearby alluvial soils sourced from Sierra Nevada granite. I evaluate patterns of electrical conductivity (EC), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), and pH as proxies of salt incorporation with respect to depth in the soil profiles and with distance from the playa. I use two different approaches to determine whether salts measured in soils are derived from playa dust: arsenic (As) and ionic ratios of sodium (Na), lithium (Li), and calcium (Ca) to other major soil cations; and Sr isotopic ratios of 87Sr/86Sr. These are the first data to document the fate of Owens Lake playa dust in surrounding alluvial soils. Results indicate that playa dust is the source of salt levels found in soils more than 20 km away. More importantly, soils in direct proximity of the playa show a significant impact from playa-derived salt input. Based on extremely elevated salt levels in soils on the playa side of the nearby Alabama Hills, topography and variable wind-flow directions have important effects on sites downwind of dust sources; and these factors may be more important than mere distance from the playa in influencing the impact of salt-rich dust on soils along the Sierra Nevada alluvial piedmont. An evaluation of the severity of the impact of the playa dust on soils is a critical step toward assessing management decisions related to Owens Lake playa as well as many other lake basins that are rapidly desiccating under human influence.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Geography",Geography,Jennifer Y. King,"First, I evaluated how photodegradation by ultraviolet (UV) radiation affected litter decomposition for two litter positions in a field experiment at Sedgwick Reserve in California. I found that photodegradation increased litter mass loss by up to 30% at positions with and without radiation exposure, suggesting UV radiation had both direct and indirect contributions to litter decay. Next, effects of UV photodegradation on litter biodegradability were examined in a laboratory experiment. Surprisingly, UV radiation in summer reduced litter biodegradability by 28% through reduction of litter N availability. This result suggests that UV radiation has both positive and negative impacts on microbial decomposition of litter. Finally, I examined impacts of UV radiation on litter chemical composition at a molecular level using two-dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D NMR) spectroscopy. Although conventional fiber analysis showed no changes in lignin concentration, 2D NMR spectroscopy data revealed that UV radiation degraded lignin p-hydroxyphenyl units and lignin beta-aryl linkages. Furthermore, lignin degradation likely led to loss of hemicellulose through enhancing microbial decomposition. Plant litter decomposition is a fundamental ecosystem service because it regulates soil fertility, the turnover and fate of carbon and nutrients, and ultimately plant growth and productivity. Photodegradation recently has been proposed as a significant driver of litter decomposition in arid and semi-arid ecosystems. However, the mechanisms through which photodegradation contributes to litter decomposition remain poorly understood. In this dissertation, I conducted both field and laboratory experiments to test the hypothesis that photodegradation has both direct (through abiotic photochemical reactions) and indirect (through interacting with microbial decomposition) contributions to litter decomposition. The combined results demonstrate that photodegradation is an important contributor to litter decomposition processes in arid ecosystems like California grasslands. More importantly, my work suggests that photodegradation is not purely an abiotic process, as it has significant indirect contributions to litter decay through effects on microbial decomposition. Thus future empirical and modeling studies of litter decomposition must examine the interaction of abiotic and biotic processes in arid ecosystems. This work identifies major pathways through which photodegradation increases microbial decomposition of litter. It also advances our understanding of chemical mechanisms underlying photodegradation.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

In this research, I examine patterns of biomass accumulation in southern California chaparral shrublands at early and late stages of post-fire recovery using a combination of detailed field work and remote sensing. Using field measurements of a site with adjacent stands of varying ages and high spatial resolution imagery, I examine patterns of species composition and associated levels of biomass to characterize long-term patterns in biomass accumulation. I also evaluate the potential for utilizing shrub growth ring widths to track annual biomass accumulation in the first decade of post-fire recovery, and test for the relationship between biomass and spatial variation in factors related to the energy and water balance. In addition, I examine the potential for extending the use of shrub growth rings to track biomass across larger spatial extents using satellite-based growth metrics. The study of stands of varying ages reveals that biomass shows substantial variation even within stands of the same age, and that species composition is different in younger stands of chaparral compared to the more mature stands. In the study of growth rings, I find that while measuring growth rings widths is a valuable method for tracking biomass accumulation in the first decade following a fire, there is no apparent relationship between biomass and factors related to the energy and water balance.

Geography",Geography,David Lopez-Carr,"This dissertation develops and evaluates a vulnerability assessment termed the Livelihood Vulnerability Index (LVI). The LVI estimates the relative ability of California commercial sea urchin fishermen to cope with the change associated with proposed marine protected areas (MPAs). A key goal in establishing MPAs is to minimize the potential negative impacts and maximize conservation benefits to local fishing communities. However, current efforts to assess the impact of proposed MPAs upon fisherman livelihoods largely assume a linear relationship between percent of fishing area or revenue lost and magnitude of impact to fishermen and do not consider the differential abilities of fishermen to cope with change. The three manuscripts included in this dissertation develop the vulnerability assessment framework and methodology (Livelihood Vulnerability Index), implement and evaluate the vulnerability assessment across multiple scales, and explore how vulnerability assessment scores may be used to spatially weight and thus better represent the importance of fishing areas in marine spatial planning. The major contribution of this research is the operationalization of a method to systematically assess the vulnerability of fisherman livelihoods---an understudied population group. In applying this vulnerability assessment methodology I found that: 1) the historical and current socioeconomic, environmental, and regulatory conditions fishermen experience in a given place predicted vulnerability levels; 2) the use of weights applied to vulnerability measures within the vulnerability assessments did not significantly impact vulnerability scores and rankings; and 3) fisherman perceptions of what factors may be important to measure vulnerability levels may not coincide with the best predictors of vulnerability levels. Furthermore, in applying the vulnerability assessment output (LVI scores) to spatial fishing data I found that: 1) the use of spatial data weights may be negligible if spatial data across fishermen are highly clustered as observed in spatial fishing patterns; 2) it is important to consider the scale of analyses since analyzing data at coarser resolutions may exclude the importance of fishing grounds from smaller ports or underrepresented fishermen groups ; and 3) to suitably address the issue of scale, data aggregation techniques may be usefully applied to better represent the importance of fishing areas from underrepresented fishermen groups.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

This study evaluates microtopographic controls (1m-12m) on plant productivity on three rolling hills in Sedgwick Natural Reserve, located in south-central California. Specifically I evaluate the relationship between topographic metrics and plant biomass production through space and time. Biomass was measured using destructive harvests and seasonal Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) data. Eighty-three 1x0.5m2 quadrats of aboveground plant matter at peak biomass (ANPP) were harvested for the 2012 growing season. For the 2009 growing season, AVIRIS derived Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) was used to estimate biomass at roughly monthly intervals from March to August. I evaluate whether seasonal changes in growing degree days (GDD) was a better predictor of plant phenological events than cumulative days since first soil moisture increase. To characterize topography, I used a 1m resolution digital elevation model derived from terrestrial lidar data to calculate curvature, aspect, and the Compound Topographic Index (CTI) - an index that integrates the flow accumulation area and slope. Using GDD, I found that ecosystem productivity was not temperature limited early in the growing season. Using webcam images I was able to remotely monitor phenological events quantitatively, but was not able to calculate NDVI because I lacked appropriate spectral bands. Plants growing on north facing slopes consistently had higher ANPP than those on south facing slopes, due to lower temperatures, hence greater preservation of soil moisture. No correlation was found between CTI or curvature and ANPP across the 83 sampled points in 2012, potentially because it was a dry year and there was limited water redistribution to lower positions in the landscape. Although a relationship between topography and soil moisture is probably valid for humid areas, it is subject to considerable variability in semiarid grasslands because during low rainfall years, evapotranspiration consumes much of the moisture that could be available for downslope movement. In these settings it is important to consider the amount and duration of water input as well as soil properties in understanding the distribution of soil moisture as it might influence plant productivity.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Geography",Geography,Dar A. Roberts,"Urban trees are strategically important in a city's effort to mitigate their carbon footprint, heat island effects, air pollution, and stormwater runoff. Currently, the most common method for quantifying urban forest structure and ecosystem function is through field plot sampling. However, taking intensive structural measurements on private properties throughout a city is difficult, and the outputs from sample inventories are not spatially explicit. The overarching goal of this dissertation is to develop methods for mapping urban forest structure and function using fused hyperspectral imagery and waveform lidar data at the individual tree crown scale. Urban forest ecosystem services estimated using the USDA Forest Service's i-Tree Eco (formerly UFORE) model are based largely on tree species and leaf area index (LAI). Accordingly, tree species were mapped in my Santa Barbara, California study area for 29 species comprising >80% of canopy. Crown-scale discriminant analysis methods were introduced for fusing Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometry (AVIRIS) data with a suite of lidar structural metrics (e.g., tree height, crown porosity) to maximize classification accuracy in a complex environment. AVIRIS imagery was critical to achieving an overall species-level accuracy of 83.4% while lidar data was most useful for improving the discrimination of small and morphologically unique species. LAI was estimated at both the field-plot scale using laser penetration metrics and at the crown scale using allometry. Agreement of the former with photographic estimates of gap fraction and the latter with allometric estimates based on field measurements was examined. Results indicate that lidar may be used reasonably to measure LAI in an urban environment lacking in continuous canopy and characterized by high species diversity. Finally, urban ecosystem services such as carbon storage and building energy-use modification were analyzed through combination of aforementioned methods and the i-Tree Eco modeling framework.

The main function of urban irrigation is to maintain landscape vegetation greenness and growth. The objectives of this study were (1) to examine the relationships and distributions among urban vegetation greenness, irrigated areas, and irrigation rates within single-family residential (SFR) areas; and (2) to assess irrigation rates via landscape vegetation water demand to better understand trends of SFR water consumption. A time series of SPOT 5 satellite images (10-m resolution) was used to derive a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) thresholding approach for mapping irrigated areas in connection with monthly SFR water billing records for 2005-2007 in the City of Los Angeles, California. The water needs for landscape vegetation were estimated using a vegetation water demand model that included climate, vegetation, and irrigated areas variables. A water conservation ratio was calculated to elucidate the relationships between irrigation and vegetation water demand, and to assess spatio-temporal patterns of SFR outdoor water consumption. The lower vegetation greenness suggested that vegetation was enduring water-stress conditions even though estimated outdoor water consumption is typically highest in dry years. The distributions of irrigated areas, irrigation rates and vegetation greenness revealed distinct patterns of land lot sizes owned by SFR households within different areas. The results from the relationship between irrigation rates, vegetation water demand and vegetation greenness highlighted the potential applications of household irrigation systems and selection of landscape vegetation species. The irrigation rates were influenced by climate variability through different water years (i.e., precipitation and ETo). The water conservation ratio could also detect over-irrigation conditions spatially from different SFR land lot sizes, and incorporate a vegetation water demand approach.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

These watersheds are located in the Oregon Cascades, California Sierra Nevada, and Colorado Rocky Mountains. Water availability in these systems is driven on a first order by annual precipitation. The majority of their precipitation is received in the winter and their forests are generally water-limited in the summer. However, they differ in the magnitude of annual precipitation received, the fraction of winter precipitation received as snow, and their seasonal energy demands. The response of these ecosystems to inter-annual climate variation is also a function of soil storage and ecophysiological characteristics. I will present research motivated by three research questions. How do soil characteristics and climate interact to influence forest water availability? How do uncertainties in forest ecophysiology, carbon allocation strategy, and their interaction effect mature forest carbon and streamflow estimates? Finally, how do climate and carbon allocation strategy influence the rate of forest growth and streamflow recovery following disturbance? I use a physically-based model, the Regional Hydro-Ecologic Simulation System, to address these questions. Results indicate that the influence of soil storage on evapotranspiration's sensitivity to climate drivers varies across sites. In the Sierra Nevada and Cascades, low soil storage increases the sensitivity of annual ET to climate drivers. Evapotranspiration in Colorado, which is water-limited but has a summer monsoonal pulse, is not sensitive to changes in soil storage. Estimates of forest carbon sequestration differ significantly between three carbon allocation strategies in mature (100-300) forests. Biomass estimates for leaf and fine root pools were strongly sensitive to allocation strategy and ecophysiological characteristics in the Sierra Nevada watershed. Streamflow estimates in this drier watershed are also more sensitive to vegetation ecophysiology. I show that the effect of allocation strategy effects estimates of recovery in forest LAI and streamflow more than climate variability at al three sites. This research contributes to the coupled ecosystem modeling community's understanding of key processes that influence our ability to predict water resources.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Although CH4 plume mapping did not motivate the NASA Airborne Visible InfraRed Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) design and municipal air quality monitoring stations were not intended for studying marine geological seepage, these assets have capabilities that can make them viable for studying concentrated (high flux, highly heterogeneous) CH4 sources, such as the Coal Oil Point (COP) seep field (_0.015 Tg CH4 yr-1) offshore Santa Barbara, California. Hourly total hydrocarbon (THC) data, spanning 1990 to 2008 from an air pollution station located near COP, were analyzed and showed geologic CH4 emissions as the dominant local source. A band ratio approach was developed and applied to high glint AVIRIS data over COP, resulting in local-scale mapping of natural atmospheric CH4 plumes. A Cluster-Tuned Matched Filter (CTMF) technique was applied to Gulf of Mexico AVIRIS data to detect CH4 venting from offshore platforms.

The variations of precipitation extremes are particularly important in southern California with its pronounced seasonal rainfall regime and landscape that is prone to fire events. The historical variability of precipitation in Santa Barbara County is examined on varying timescales and then compared to several phenomena believed to control precipitation in the region. Hourly precipitation data are gathered from seven local stations covering roughly the past forty years (1970--2010). The climatology of precipitation in the region including intensity and persistences of storm episodes is examined. The patterns and variations of precipitations are then compared to three main teleconnection phenomena: the El Nino Southern Oscillation, the Madden-Julian Oscillation, and atmospheric rivers. The underlying goal of this research is to gain a comprehensive understanding of precipitation climatology in the region and the features that influence control over it.

Geography",Geography,"Christopher J. Still, Leila MV Carvalho","The presence of low-lying stratocumulus clouds and fog has been known to modify biophysical and ecological properties in a variety of ecosystems in different climates. This is especially true for California's Channel Islands, where forests are frequently shaded by low-lying clouds or immersed in fog during warm and dry summer months. Previous studies suggest that clouds strongly modulate forest distributions as well as carbon and water budgets in these semi-arid environments by reducing solar insolation and raising relative humidity and thus reducing evapotranspiration, while also potentially supplying water directly to the landscape from fog-drip. While summertime fog and stratus cover in California's Channel Islands can ameliorate summer drought stress and enhance soil water budgets, they often have different spatial and temporal patterns. These differing patterns and the resulting shifts in relative ecological importance of fog and stratus are understudied. The overall objective of this study is to map spatial and temporal distributions of daytime cloud cover frequency for the California Channel Islands, and to predict probabilities of surface cloud (fog) contact and immersion for these islands. The results of this research are significant for water balance modeling, help explain vegetation patterns on the islands, and better identify locations where native vegetation restoration efforts are likely to be most successful.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Geography",Geography,Oliver A. Chadwick,"Global anthropogenic desiccation of lake basins in arid and semi-arid areas result in substantial increases in the flux of aeolian material. In California, Owens Lake playa has produced a tremendous amount of windblown dust since its desiccation in the early 20th century. In view of the potential danger to human health of the dust blowing off the playa, the chemistry and mineralogy of playa sediments and dust are well known. By contrast, the impact of the dust on surrounding soils and ecosystems in Owens Valley has been less well studied. This dissertation documents the accumulation of dust-derived salts from Owens Lake playa in nearby alluvial soils sourced from Sierra Nevada granite. I evaluate patterns of electrical conductivity (EC), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), and pH as proxies of salt incorporation with respect to depth in the soil profiles and with distance from the playa. I use two different approaches to determine whether salts measured in soils are derived from playa dust: arsenic (As) and ionic ratios of sodium (Na), lithium (Li), and calcium (Ca) to other major soil cations; and Sr isotopic ratios of 87Sr/86Sr. These are the first data to document the fate of Owens Lake playa dust in surrounding alluvial soils. Results indicate that playa dust is the source of salt levels found in soils more than 20 km away. More importantly, soils in direct proximity of the playa show a significant impact from playa-derived salt input. Based on extremely elevated salt levels in soils on the playa side of the nearby Alabama Hills, topography and variable wind-flow directions have important effects on sites downwind of dust sources; and these factors may be more important than mere distance from the playa in influencing the impact of salt-rich dust on soils along the Sierra Nevada alluvial piedmont. An evaluation of the severity of the impact of the playa dust on soils is a critical step toward assessing management decisions related to Owens Lake playa as well as many other lake basins that are rapidly desiccating under human influence.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Geography",Geography,Ming-Hsiang Tsou,"Many geography phenomena and geospatial problems are complex and dynamic. Traditional Geographic Information System (GIS) models have limitations to represent the detailed dynamic processes of geospatial phenomena in the real world. This dissertation introduces a new GIS model framework which can simulate complex population change by using large amounts of real-world data sets and high performance computing resources. This research developed parallel GIS simulation models using cellular automata (CA) and agent-based modeling (ABM) that have been very popular in urban geography. The case study of the parallel GIS simulation models in this dissertation focused on the population change in the County of San Diego, California. In particular, for the parallel ABM, this research modified the original Schelling model, a popular residential segregation model, to process over 2.8 million resident agents. With the high performance computing capability, the GIS models could simulate the dynamics of population change efficiently and help us understand the formation of residential segregation in the future. In addition, the case study demonstrated performance improvement, technical feasibility, and implementation challenges of the parallelization of GIS simulation models in CA and ABM. While high-performance computing is essential for many scientific research disciplines and the domain of computational science, very few geospatial scientists have utilized high-performance computing for the analysis of geographic problems. One of the important reasons is the lack of accessible high-performance computing resources. A new user-friendly web portal framework was designed and implemented to integrate distributed computing resources and to provide high-performance computing capabilities for GIS models. Grid computing and cloud computing resources were integrated into the web portal framework with accessible web-based user interfaces. Usability test was conducted at the end of this study to evaluate the accessibility and functions of the new web portal prototype in high-performance computing environments. The test results indicated that many users did not prefer the detailed configurations of high-performance computing resources. This study suggested that the detailed settings of high-performance computing environments should be concealed in the web-based user interface designed for scientists or geographers, who could focus more on geographic problems.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Geography, Joint Program SDSU","Geography, Joint Program SDSU",Douglas A. Stow,"Southern California shrublands are threatened by nonnative European annual grasses, which contribute to substantial fragmentation and loss of these ecologically important communities. Both natural and anthropogenic disturbances provide opportunities for competitive exotic herbaceous species to colonize in gaps in shrublands and overtake native grasses and shrubs. Remote sensing using moderate resolution imagery can provide a spatially comprehensive, cost-effective, and repeatable approach to monitor the establishment and expansion of nonnative herbaceous cover into sensitive habitats, and provide the potential for detecting native herbaceous cover where it occurs in high fractions. The underlying goal of this study is to better understand the temporal, spectral, and spatial characteristics of herbaceous vegetation in California shrublands in the context of effectively mapping and monitoring herbaceous vegetation cover using remote sensing methods. Chapter 2 provides the details of the phenological response and spectral properties of native and nonnative herbaceous cover, based on plot-based fieldwork conducted in CSS habitat in the San Diego National Wildlife Refuge (SDNWR). High temporal resolution field spectroscopic data were shown to be useful for determining when native and nonnative herbaceous vegetation in CSS are most spectrally separable in the course of a growing season. In Chapter 3, intraannual remote sensing methods are explored to map herbaceous cover fraction in shrublands. Optimal discernment of herbaceous cover was found using single-date imagery timed in the early summer months (early June in 2010); fractional cover of growth forms was mapped with errors of 0.08 or less. Chapter 4 investigates the stability and reliability of cover fractions modeled using a multitemporal remote sensing approach. MESMA applied to three dates (2008, 2010, and 2011) of SPOT imagery was used successfully to model growth form fractions over a large extent of shrubland vegetation with low individual and overall error. Findings from this study indicate that MESMA applied to moderate resolution imagery timed to maximize spectral differences between growth forms is an effective approach for quantifying changes in fractional cover that exceeds ten percent, providing a way to delineate and quantify herbaceous invasions and expansions following disturbance or succession.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Geography, Joint Program SDSU","Geography, Joint Program SDSU",Douglas A. Stow,"This dissertation explores the readiness of remote sensing science, in terms of methodological prescription and theory, to address time-sensitive information requirements. It synthesizes and evaluates predominant conceptualizations of remote sensing and critically evaluates them in terms of their ability to inform the design of remote sensing systems to address time-sensitive information requirements, presents a novel conceptual model of remote sensing based in information theory, and demonstrates the evaluation and updating of a remote sensing system to meet the time-sensitive information requirements of wildfire managers in California. In chapter 2, current conceptualizations of remote sensing are found lacking in their ability to inform the optimization of remote sensing systems for application to time-sensitive phenomena because they omit several factors affecting the timeliness of information delivery. Characteristics of a conceptual remote sensing model appropriate for time-sensitive remote sensing are identified; such a model should: (1) conceptualize the collection of technologies used to acquire, process, and distribute remote sensing information as a single system that can be optimized; (2) acknowledge that remote sensing exists to inform decisions; (3) recognize that the decision maker (i.e., user) and information are both fundamental to the effectiveness of such decisions; and (4) account for tradeoffs between the type, reliability, and timeless of information produced by remote sensing systems. The Fields of Operations Research, Decision Science, and Systems Theory are highlighted as likely sources for methods and theory on the optimization of remote sensing systems to meet the needs of specific users and user groups. Chapter 3 presents a conceptual model of remote sensing as a communication system for the transmission of information; the remote sensing communication model. The mathematical model of communication from engineering, broader philosophical perspectives on the nature of information and communication, and the map communication model are used to conceptualize remote sensing a communication system, explain the production, communication, and ingestion of remote sensing information, and to estimate the timeliness of information delivery by remote sensing systems. The remote sensing communication model places remote sensing within a decision support context, where the effectiveness of a decision and the subsequent value of an information product is dependent upon both the qualities of the information (e.g., timeliness, accuracy) and the nature of the decision process (e.g., user bias, technical expertise, cartographic proficiency). The conceptualization of remote sensing as a communication system permits the estimation of sensor, channel, and receiver capacity. Methods for the estimation of sensor, channel, and receiver capacity are outlined, but further research into the reliable estimation of both human and automated receivers is warranted. Chapter 4 applies the Remote Sensing Communication Model (RSCM) to improve a tactical wildfire remote sensing system to better meet the time sensitive information requirements of emergency response managers in San Diego County, USA. A thermal infrared airborne remote sensing system designed and operated by the United States Forest Service Pacific Southwest Research Station for active wildfire monitoring is documented and updated based on the RCSM. Analysis of the thermal infrared remote sensing system in the context of the RSCM identified three configuration changes that can improve the effectiveness of the information produced when employed by wildfire incident commanders for suppression prioritization: (1) limit spectral sampling collection to a single waveband; (2) complete image processing steps onboard; and (3) provide information on wildfire locations to incident commanders in the form of a static map. Collectively, this research evaluates current theoretical and methodological approaches to the design of RSSs using a structured approach and proposes a novel conceptual model of remote sensing grounded in geographic and information theory. It explores and highlights the issues and challenges presented by the use of remote sensing to fulfill time-sensitive information requirements, defines a common vocabulary for their discussion, and provides methods for the systematic evaluation and design of RSSs to address time-sensitive information requirements. Going forward, it would seem that the fields of Operations Research, Decisions Science, Systems Theory, and Software Engineering could make significant contributions toward the development of both theoretical and practical approaches to the design of remote sensing systems to address time-sensitive information requirements. The limited operational use of remote sensing to address time-sensitive information requirements and collective finding of this dissertation suggest that the development of RSSs for specific time-sensitive applications (e.g., wildfire response, earthquake response, oil spill response) and response areas, such that those preconfigured RSSs can be activated during an appropriate event and provide appropriate information products that are easily employed by decisions makers, is likely the only way to ensure the effective use remote sensing in a hazard response context, and likely time-sensitive applications in general.

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Jordan Clark,"The current drought crisis in California highlights the vulnerability of freshwater resources, particularly groundwater reservoirs, which supply up to 60% of California's water during drought years. Understanding the potential impacts of climate change on groundwater recharge and storage is critical as drought periods become more frequent in the state. Groundwater residence times provide insight into groundwater recharge and transport mechanisms and storage capacities. This study developed and evaluated a new intrinsic tracer method to quantify groundwater recharge and transport using the occurrence of the naturally-produced radioisotope sulfur-35 (35S, half-life 87.5 days) in water as dissolved sulfate (35SO4). Improvements made to established analytical techniques expand the analytical range of 35SO4, which broadens the utility of 35SO 4 as a hydrologic tracer. The 35SO4 tracer method was applied to two distinct hydrologic settings: 1) high-elevation Sierra Nevada basins, and 2) low-elevations basins containing managed aquifer recharge (MAR) facilities. In the Sierra Nevada study, the new 35SO4 method was used to empirically constrain annual groundwater recharge in Sagehen Creek Basin (SCB) and Martis Valley Groundwater Basin (MVGB). Compared to relatively high 5SO4 activity in seasonal snowmelt (5.5 +/- 0.3 to 52.9 +/- 3.4 mBq/L), groundwater and surface water consistently yielded low 35SO4 activities resulting in a calculated percent new snowmelt (PNS) of <30%. The consistently low PNS suggests that recent (<1 year old) snowmelt represents only a small fraction of the larger aquifer system. As snowpack continues to decline due to climate change, streamflow and springs may respond in a two phase manner: rapid response in discharge followed by more gradual decreases over decades due to declines in groundwater recharge. The MAR study used 35SO4 to quantify groundwater travel times near MAR operations. MAR sites divert excess surface water, imported water, and reclaimed wastewater into surface-spreading ponds or direct injection wells to replenish groundwater in heavy-usage areas. Identifying groundwater travel times near MAR facilities is critical for determining the fate and transport of potential contaminants, especially for facilities that incorporate a significant portion of reclaimed wastewater. Successful application of the 35SO4 tracer method near MAR sites is dependent on careful characterization of the 35SO4 activity in source waters. Relative to established deliberate tracer experiments, which require extensive field and laboratory effort, the less intensive 35SO 4 technique showed comparable groundwater travel times at two MAR facilities located in southern California. Both the Sierra Nevada and MAR studies demonstrate that 35SO4 is a valuable, yet underutilized tracer in hydrologic studies.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Ralph Archuleta,"The seismic velocity structure in the southern San Andreas Fault region is characterized by a known, distinct seismic velocity contrast on opposite sides of the fault, with a thick sedimentary region on the west side (Salton Sea area). Reverberations would affect the duration of shaking for El Centro, Mexicali, and other communities in the Coachella Valley and Imperial Valley. Furthermore, there are other areas where deep basins are bounded by faults that could have similar effects. Therefore, being able to determine the 3D structure is a critical facet of assessing the overall seismic hazard for structures on such basins. By utilizing the particle motion of surface waves, we are able extract useful information about the S-wave velocity structure. To accomplish this, we measured Rayleigh-wave ellipticity of continuous broadband data from 2010 to 2014 for 67 stations within the Southern California Seismic Network (SCSN). Measurements of Rayleigh-wave ellipticity were computed as the ratio between the vertical and horizontal amplitudes. Regional variations in the Rayleigh-wave ellipticity measurements at frequencies of 0.10 Hz up to and including 0.30 Hz illuminate small ellipticity values (i.e. horizontal elongation in Rayleigh-wave particle motion) across the entire frequency band in the regions specific to the thick sedimentary region. In this region, minimum ellipticity values (<0.20) observed at 0.10 Hz, 0.15 Hz, and at 0.20 Hz show a gradual increase up to 0.60 between 0.25 Hz to 0.40 Hz. In most areas exterior to the thick sedimentary region, ellipticity values are generally constant across the frequency band and are significantly higher (>0.90). The observed, small ellipticity values, which are characteristic of a slow velocity layer at shallow depths (upper 5-10 km), could have significant implications on the S-wave velocity structure. As the ZH-Ratio method is highly sensitive to the near-surface structure, combination of the ellipticity data with phase velocity data measured via noise cross-correlation could provide further compelling insight in the shallow S-wave velocity structure, particularly in the upper 5 km.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Ralph J. Archuleta,"Stress drop is the stress that is effectively available to drive fault motion. It is a key parameter in predicting peak ground acceleration (PGA), since PGA, and it is very important in estimating ground motion. However, it is difficult to get an accurate estimation of stress drop. In order to get a more stable measurement of stress drop, we test two methods in this thesis: the first one is the Brune stress drop, which is more commonly applied, and the second one is the Arms stress drop, which less applied before and theoretically should have less uncertainty. By comparing these two methods we would like to test the feasibility and stability of the Arms method. We applied these two methods to data of earthquakes M3-5.5 in California and Oklahoma. We found that, taking Oklahoma results as an example, the mean value of Brune stress drop is 0.38 MPa, with a multiplicative uncertainty of 3.12, and the mean value of Arms stress drop is 1.04, with a multiplicative uncertainty of 1.79. Therefore we concluded that the Arms method is a good estimator of stress drop, with a smaller uncertainty.

Cottle,"Zircon from a porphyritic hornblende diorite pluton exposed in the northern part of the MVR also yield an age of 165 Ma, suggesting a genetic link between emplacement of this intrusive suite and melting of the Pinto Gneiss to form the pegmatite veins. Based on the similarity in ages between monazite, xenotime and zircon in the Pinto Gneiss, along with relict 'igneous' zoning in the ore-bearing phosphate minerals, REE mineralization is interpreted to have occurred during crystallization of the igneous protolith of the Pinto Gneiss. Diorite/amphibolite emplacement at _1.4 Ga and pegmatite genesis at _165 Ma post-date the main phase of REE mineralization, but likely played a role in fluid-assisted alteration of the ore bodies and partial resetting of monazite and xenotime ages in the Pinto Gneiss. Textures inferred to be the result of dissolution re-precipitation reactions overprint relict oscillatory zoning with xenotime and uranothorite [(U,Th)SiO4 ] forming from the breakdown of monazite and monazite and uranothorite forming from the breakdown of xenotime, suggesting late-stage fluid mediated alteration of the ore minerals. Localized breakdown of monazite, anorthite and biotite to apatite and allanite provides further evidence for post-mineralization metasomatism of the ore bodies. In-situ monazite and xenotime U-Pb geochronology constrains REE mineralization to _1.71 Ga, consistent with zircon dates obtained from the Pinto Gneiss. Zircon from the diorite/amphibolite are _1.4 Ga, inferred to represent the emplacement age of this unit, whereas zircon in the pegmatite veins yield ages of _1.65Ma. Monazite [(LREE)PO4] and xenotime [(HREE,Y)PO4] occur in ore-grade concentrations within the Pinto Gneiss in the Music Valley region (MVR) of southern California. However, both the age and petrogenesis of this potentially economically significant rare earth element (REE) deposit remain uncertain. A combined petrologic and geochronologic study yields insight into the textural and temporal relationships between REE mineralization and the host rock. Ore-forming monazite and xenotime are typically restricted to biotite folia within the host Pinto Gneiss with highest modal abundances occurring within a few meters of contacts between the host gneiss and a diorite/amphibolite intrusive unit, the latter of which is cross-cut by pegmatite veins that appear to have been generated by partial melting of the Pinto Gneiss.

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Phillip B. Gans,"The history of late Miocene (Proto-Gulf) deformation on the Sonoran margin of the Gulf of California is key to understanding how Baja California was captured by the Pacific plate and how strain was partitioned during the Proto-Gulf period (12.5-6 Ma). The Sierra el Aguaje and Sierra Tinajas del Carmen are located in southwestern coastal Sonora, Mexico, and represent the eastern rifted margin of the central Gulf of California. The ranges are composed of volcanic units and their corresponding volcaniclastic units which are the result of persistent magmatic activity between 20 and 8.8 Ma, including three packages of basalt and andesite that make excellent paleomagnetic recorders. Based on cross cutting relations and geochronologic data for pre-, syn-, and post-tectonic volcanic units, most of the faulting and tilting in the Sierra El Aguaje is bracketed between 11.9 and 9.0 Ma, thus falling entirely within Proto-Gulf time. A paleomagnetic investigation into possible vertical axis rotations in the Sierra el Aguaje has uncovered evidence of clockwise rotations between ~13 and ~105 with possible translations. These results are consistent with existing field relations, which suggest the presence of large (>45) vertical axis rotations in this region. This evidence includes: a) abrupt changes in the strike of tilted strata in different parts of the range, including large domains characterized by E-W strikes b) ubiquitous NE-SW striking faults with left lateral-normal oblique slip, that terminate against major NW-trending right lateral faults, and c) obliquity between the general strike of tilted strata and the strike of faults. These rotations occurred after 12 Ma and largely prior to 9 Ma, thus falling into the Proto-Gulf period. Such large-scale rotations lend credence to the theory that the area inboard of Baja California was experiencing transtension during the Proto-Gulf period, rather than the pure extension that would be the result of strain partitioning between Sonora and the Tosco-Abreojos fault offshore Baja California.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Alexander Simms,"Establishing sea-cliff erosion rates is a vital component of coastal zone management. Laser scanning technology can provide a fast, reliable, and accurate means to survey sea-cliffs covering large areas of the coastline and to establish local erosion rates. The technology allows for the rapid laterally continuous survey of sea-cliffs with Dynamic Laser Scanning (DLS) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) surveys. Data collected from DLS and LiDAR surveys for southern Santa Barbara County were compared in a Geographic Information System (GIS). This study establishes regional erosion rates using NOAA LiDAR data along southern Santa Barbara County coastal bluffs from Point Conception to Rincon Point (Carpinteria, California). Regional retreat rates for southern Santa Barbara County calculated in GIS from 1998 and 2010 NOAA LiDAR data range from 4 to 73 cm yr-1. Local erosion rates were also established along Lagoon Road on the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) campus and at Point Conception. The average retreat rate at UCSB calculated from 1997 LiDAR and 2012 DLS data was 24 cm yr-1. Areas along Lagoon Road protected by rip rap have lower average retreat rates of 15 cm yr-1. The Lagoon Road retreat rates are similar to manually surveyed rates along these same cliffs. Erosion rates along the Lagoon Road sea-cliff with active drain pipes, seepage, and tree falls were expected to experience higher cliff erosion rates than sections of the sea-cliff without these influences, but the results of this study did not confirm my hypothesis. Retreat rates at Lagoon Road were higher than retreat rates at Point Conception. The higher rates are attributed to the presence of excessive surface runoff and the orientation of the dip of the beds. Comparison of 100 m of overlapping DLS data along Lagoon Road from November 2011 and January 2012 suggests that the top of the cliff is retreating at a higher rate than the base, which is a consequence of excess surface runoff. The aspect of the sea-cliff was also found to have an influence on erosion rates, with higher retreat rates correlating to south facing sea-cliffs. Unless measures are taken to impede the current rate of erosion along Lagoon Road, the road will be undercut in 60 years.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Edward A. Keller,"Bar-built coastal lagoons are common coastal landforms that typically occupy drowned river valleys and exist in wave-dominated areas characterized by seasonal rainfall. Wave-driven sedimentation often seasonally closes the inlet, forming a perched estuary that is separated from the ocean by a sand or gravel beach barrier. The pressure on these systems and their ability to provide important ecosystem services will increase in the 21st century due to climate change, sea-level rise, and continued population growth within their watersheds and estuarine margins. To better understand how coastal lagoons function, this work addressed three main topics: 1) the observed variable patterns of breaching and closure, 2) the beach-barrier groundwater connection, and 3) the role of watershed variability in estuary geomorphology. A hydrologic and geomorphic model of estuary breaching and closure was developed, assessed, and then used to examine how estuarine and beach processes affect the breaching and closure processes. The model is based upon the continuity equation for the estuary water balance, and a geomorphic component for the inlet that incorporates inlet sedimentation by waves and erosion by fluvial processes. The root mean square error of the predicted versus observed estuary stage was 0.45m, 0.39m, and 0.42m for three separate years when the inlet drained directly across the berm, and the model was able to reproduce the initial seasonal breaching, seasonal closure, intermittent closures and breaches, and the low-streamflow (closed state) estuary hydrology of the Carmel Lagoon, located in Central California. Model results show that estuary function (eg amount of time inlet is closed, low-flow hydrology, frequency of breaching) is sensitive to realistic variations in beach berm characteristics (hydraulic conductivity, height, etc.), estuary storage, and especially hydrologic inflow. Sea-level rise will potentially cause the estuary to behave more like a coastal lake. Groundwater and estuarine waterlevel observations indicate that the beach barrier aquifer provides a dynamic hydrologic connection between the ocean and the closed lagoon. Groundwater flow is predominantly oceanward for the conditions observed, and the flux is modulated by tides at all estuary waterlevels, reversing directions only during wave overtopping events that fully saturate the beach. A numerical model of barrier groundwater was calibrated with constrained input parameters and assessed using observed groundwater heads. The model accounts for berm morphology, swash infiltration, wave set-up, and a sloping no-flow bottom boundary. The model accurately reproduces observed groundwater fluctuations (RMSE is 0.062m, 0.074m, 0.022m for three wells), except during wave overtopping events, and model results indicate that the seepage flux (and its variance), groundwater heads, and width of the seepage face are all underpredicted when the topography of the berm is not incorporated into the model. Sensitivity analyses emphasize the importance of wave swash on model performance. Nineteen small, shallow lagoons in a tectonically active, low-wave energy region were mapped and analyzed to determine how watershed processes shape estuary geomorphology. Multiple linear regression analyses indicate that variability in lagoon area, length, volume, average width, circularity, and lagoon width expansion are primarily the result of variability in watershed precipitation and channel slope upstream of the lagoons. The coefficients of determination for the power function regressions are 0.88 (lagoon area), 0.88 (lagoon length), 0.83 (lagoon volume), and 0.74 (average width).",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Jordan F. Clark,"California guidelines for recycled water reuse currently give preference to groundwater tracers to determine underground retention time, with a target retention time of >6 months from infiltration to drinking water extraction. Two prospective tracers were evaluated here: boron-10 (10B, the lesser abundant boron stable isotope), and heat (with recharging water warmed at sewage treatment plants and by solar radiation in surface-spreading basins). Bromide (Br-), a conservative deliberate salt tracer with limitations to low-volume settings, was released as a control. Tracer injection occurred when 3 kg of 10B-enriched boric acid and 36 kg of NaBr were added to the research test basin at San Gabriel Spreading Grounds, part of the Montebello Forebay, Los Angeles County, CA, USA. Recycled wastewater was piped directly to this basin at a rate of 2200 m3/day for ~two continuous months. 10B and Br- tracer breakthroughs were observed at seven monitoring wells ranging from directly beneath the basin floor to 150 m downgradient. Travel times ranged from 0.7 to 40 days. Arrival of Br- to each well was always coincident or preceded 10B arrival, reflecting retardation of 10B presumably due to exchange with clay surfaces. 10B/Br - travel time ratios determined from the center of mass ranged from 1 to 1.4. Travel times were successfully determined to all wells. Peak matching of diurnal variations was only possible at the nearest well (<1 day travel time). Basic analysis of temperature measurements, even in the absence of peak matching, yielded a reliable estimate of the underground residence time. Heat has great potential as an intrinsic tracer for managed recharge applications. Based on average tracer travel times, a vertical flow line directly below the test basin had an average vertical velocity of 3.3 m/day, equivalent to a recharge rate of 0.8 m/day.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Jordan Clark,"The current drought crisis in California highlights the vulnerability of freshwater resources, particularly groundwater reservoirs, which supply up to 60% of California's water during drought years. Understanding the potential impacts of climate change on groundwater recharge and storage is critical as drought periods become more frequent in the state. Groundwater residence times provide insight into groundwater recharge and transport mechanisms and storage capacities. This study developed and evaluated a new intrinsic tracer method to quantify groundwater recharge and transport using the occurrence of the naturally-produced radioisotope sulfur-35 (35S, half-life 87.5 days) in water as dissolved sulfate (35SO4). Improvements made to established analytical techniques expand the analytical range of 35SO4, which broadens the utility of 35SO 4 as a hydrologic tracer. The 35SO4 tracer method was applied to two distinct hydrologic settings: 1) high-elevation Sierra Nevada basins, and 2) low-elevations basins containing managed aquifer recharge (MAR) facilities. In the Sierra Nevada study, the new 35SO4 method was used to empirically constrain annual groundwater recharge in Sagehen Creek Basin (SCB) and Martis Valley Groundwater Basin (MVGB). Compared to relatively high 5SO4 activity in seasonal snowmelt (5.5 +/- 0.3 to 52.9 +/- 3.4 mBq/L), groundwater and surface water consistently yielded low 35SO4 activities resulting in a calculated percent new snowmelt (PNS) of <30%. The consistently low PNS suggests that recent (<1 year old) snowmelt represents only a small fraction of the larger aquifer system. As snowpack continues to decline due to climate change, streamflow and springs may respond in a two phase manner: rapid response in discharge followed by more gradual decreases over decades due to declines in groundwater recharge. The MAR study used 35SO4 to quantify groundwater travel times near MAR operations. MAR sites divert excess surface water, imported water, and reclaimed wastewater into surface-spreading ponds or direct injection wells to replenish groundwater in heavy-usage areas. Identifying groundwater travel times near MAR facilities is critical for determining the fate and transport of potential contaminants, especially for facilities that incorporate a significant portion of reclaimed wastewater. Successful application of the 35SO4 tracer method near MAR sites is dependent on careful characterization of the 35SO4 activity in source waters. Relative to established deliberate tracer experiments, which require extensive field and laboratory effort, the less intensive 35SO 4 technique showed comparable groundwater travel times at two MAR facilities located in southern California. Both the Sierra Nevada and MAR studies demonstrate that 35SO4 is a valuable, yet underutilized tracer in hydrologic studies.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Ralph Archuleta,"The seismic velocity structure in the southern San Andreas Fault region is characterized by a known, distinct seismic velocity contrast on opposite sides of the fault, with a thick sedimentary region on the west side (Salton Sea area). Reverberations would affect the duration of shaking for El Centro, Mexicali, and other communities in the Coachella Valley and Imperial Valley. Furthermore, there are other areas where deep basins are bounded by faults that could have similar effects. Therefore, being able to determine the 3D structure is a critical facet of assessing the overall seismic hazard for structures on such basins. By utilizing the particle motion of surface waves, we are able extract useful information about the S-wave velocity structure. To accomplish this, we measured Rayleigh-wave ellipticity of continuous broadband data from 2010 to 2014 for 67 stations within the Southern California Seismic Network (SCSN). Measurements of Rayleigh-wave ellipticity were computed as the ratio between the vertical and horizontal amplitudes. Regional variations in the Rayleigh-wave ellipticity measurements at frequencies of 0.10 Hz up to and including 0.30 Hz illuminate small ellipticity values (i.e. horizontal elongation in Rayleigh-wave particle motion) across the entire frequency band in the regions specific to the thick sedimentary region. In this region, minimum ellipticity values (<0.20) observed at 0.10 Hz, 0.15 Hz, and at 0.20 Hz show a gradual increase up to 0.60 between 0.25 Hz to 0.40 Hz. In most areas exterior to the thick sedimentary region, ellipticity values are generally constant across the frequency band and are significantly higher (>0.90). The observed, small ellipticity values, which are characteristic of a slow velocity layer at shallow depths (upper 5-10 km), could have significant implications on the S-wave velocity structure. As the ZH-Ratio method is highly sensitive to the near-surface structure, combination of the ellipticity data with phase velocity data measured via noise cross-correlation could provide further compelling insight in the shallow S-wave velocity structure, particularly in the upper 5 km.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

We found that, taking Oklahoma results as an example, the mean value of Brune stress drop is 0.38 MPa, with a multiplicative uncertainty of 3.12, and the mean value of Arms stress drop is 1.04, with a multiplicative uncertainty of 1.79. Therefore we concluded that the Arms method is a good estimator of stress drop, with a smaller uncertainty. We determine the path attenuation so that we can increase the source-station distance of events studied to be as much as 76 km. The path seismic attenuation is a critical parameter that must be included in the analysis.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Cottle,"Zircon from a porphyritic hornblende diorite pluton exposed in the northern part of the MVR also yield an age of 165 Ma, suggesting a genetic link between emplacement of this intrusive suite and melting of the Pinto Gneiss to form the pegmatite veins. Based on the similarity in ages between monazite, xenotime and zircon in the Pinto Gneiss, along with relict 'igneous' zoning in the ore-bearing phosphate minerals, REE mineralization is interpreted to have occurred during crystallization of the igneous protolith of the Pinto Gneiss. Diorite/amphibolite emplacement at _1.4 Ga and pegmatite genesis at _165 Ma post-date the main phase of REE mineralization, but likely played a role in fluid-assisted alteration of the ore bodies and partial resetting of monazite and xenotime ages in the Pinto Gneiss. Textures inferred to be the result of dissolution re-precipitation reactions overprint relict oscillatory zoning with xenotime and uranothorite [(U,Th)SiO4 ] forming from the breakdown of monazite and monazite and uranothorite forming from the breakdown of xenotime, suggesting late-stage fluid mediated alteration of the ore minerals. Localized breakdown of monazite, anorthite and biotite to apatite and allanite provides further evidence for post-mineralization metasomatism of the ore bodies. In-situ monazite and xenotime U-Pb geochronology constrains REE mineralization to _1.71 Ga, consistent with zircon dates obtained from the Pinto Gneiss. Zircon from the diorite/amphibolite are _1.4 Ga, inferred to represent the emplacement age of this unit, whereas zircon in the pegmatite veins yield ages of _1.65Ma. Monazite [(LREE)PO4] and xenotime [(HREE,Y)PO4] occur in ore-grade concentrations within the Pinto Gneiss in the Music Valley region (MVR) of southern California. However, both the age and petrogenesis of this potentially economically significant rare earth element (REE) deposit remain uncertain. A combined petrologic and geochronologic study yields insight into the textural and temporal relationships between REE mineralization and the host rock. Ore-forming monazite and xenotime are typically restricted to biotite folia within the host Pinto Gneiss with highest modal abundances occurring within a few meters of contacts between the host gneiss and a diorite/amphibolite intrusive unit, the latter of which is cross-cut by pegmatite veins that appear to have been generated by partial melting of the Pinto Gneiss.

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Phillip B. Gans,"The history of late Miocene (Proto-Gulf) deformation on the Sonoran margin of the Gulf of California is key to understanding how Baja California was captured by the Pacific plate and how strain was partitioned during the Proto-Gulf period (12.5-6 Ma). The Sierra el Aguaje and Sierra Tinajas del Carmen are located in southwestern coastal Sonora, Mexico, and represent the eastern rifted margin of the central Gulf of California. The ranges are composed of volcanic units and their corresponding volcaniclastic units which are the result of persistent magmatic activity between 20 and 8.8 Ma, including three packages of basalt and andesite that make excellent paleomagnetic recorders. Based on cross cutting relations and geochronologic data for pre-, syn-, and post-tectonic volcanic units, most of the faulting and tilting in the Sierra El Aguaje is bracketed between 11.9 and 9.0 Ma, thus falling entirely within Proto-Gulf time. A paleomagnetic investigation into possible vertical axis rotations in the Sierra el Aguaje has uncovered evidence of clockwise rotations between ~13 and ~105 with possible translations. These results are consistent with existing field relations, which suggest the presence of large (>45) vertical axis rotations in this region. This evidence includes: a) abrupt changes in the strike of tilted strata in different parts of the range, including large domains characterized by E-W strikes b) ubiquitous NE-SW striking faults with left lateral-normal oblique slip, that terminate against major NW-trending right lateral faults, and c) obliquity between the general strike of tilted strata and the strike of faults. These rotations occurred after 12 Ma and largely prior to 9 Ma, thus falling into the Proto-Gulf period. Such large-scale rotations lend credence to the theory that the area inboard of Baja California was experiencing transtension during the Proto-Gulf period, rather than the pure extension that would be the result of strain partitioning between Sonora and the Tosco-Abreojos fault offshore Baja California.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,"Jordan F. Clark, Martin Miele","To characterize the hydro-stratigraphy of an area, drilling and well logs provide high resolution electrical resistivity data, albeit for limited areas (points). The expense of drilling indirectly leads to sparse data and it is necessary to assume lateral homogeneity between wells when creating stratigraphic maps. Unfortunately, this assumption may not apply to areas in complex depositional and tectonically active settings. The goal of this study is to fill in data gaps between wells in a groundwater basin in order to better characterize the hydro-stratigraphy under existing and potential sites for managed aquifer recharge. Basins in the southern California study area have been used for decades to recharge surface water to an upper aquifer system; this work also addresses whether the local hydro-stratigraphy favors surface infiltration as a means to recharge water to the lower aquifer system. Here, soundings of transient electromagnetism (TEM), a surface geophysical method, are correlated with nearby down-hole resistivity and lithology well logs for grain size interpretations of the subsurface in unsaturated conditions. Grain size is used as a proxy for permeability (hydraulic conductivity), with resistivity contrasts highlighting variations in the media, which would affect groundwater flow in both vertical and horizontal directions. Results suggest a nearly horizontal, extensive, low permeability layer exists in the area and only a few noted locations are favorable for surface -to-lower aquifer system recharge. Furthermore, zones of higher permeability deeper than the upper aquifer system are discontinuous and isolated among lower permeability zones. However, the TEM profiles show areas where lower permeability zones are thin, and where alternatives to surface percolation methods could be explored. In addition, the survey adds information about the transition between the upper and lower aquifer systems, and adds detail to the topography of the base of freshwater. Finally, this work effectively decreases the interpolation distance between data points of wellbores, and when viewed in sequence the TEM profiles present a 3D depiction of basin hydro-stratigraphy.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Alexander Simms,"Establishing sea-cliff erosion rates is a vital component of coastal zone management. Laser scanning technology can provide a fast, reliable, and accurate means to survey sea-cliffs covering large areas of the coastline and to establish local erosion rates. The technology allows for the rapid laterally continuous survey of sea-cliffs with Dynamic Laser Scanning (DLS) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) surveys. Data collected from DLS and LiDAR surveys for southern Santa Barbara County were compared in a Geographic Information System (GIS). This study establishes regional erosion rates using NOAA LiDAR data along southern Santa Barbara County coastal bluffs from Point Conception to Rincon Point (Carpinteria, California). Regional retreat rates for southern Santa Barbara County calculated in GIS from 1998 and 2010 NOAA LiDAR data range from 4 to 73 cm yr-1. Local erosion rates were also established along Lagoon Road on the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) campus and at Point Conception. The average retreat rate at UCSB calculated from 1997 LiDAR and 2012 DLS data was 24 cm yr-1. Areas along Lagoon Road protected by rip rap have lower average retreat rates of 15 cm yr-1. The Lagoon Road retreat rates are similar to manually surveyed rates along these same cliffs. Erosion rates along the Lagoon Road sea-cliff with active drain pipes, seepage, and tree falls were expected to experience higher cliff erosion rates than sections of the sea-cliff without these influences, but the results of this study did not confirm my hypothesis. Retreat rates at Lagoon Road were higher than retreat rates at Point Conception. The higher rates are attributed to the presence of excessive surface runoff and the orientation of the dip of the beds. Comparison of 100 m of overlapping DLS data along Lagoon Road from November 2011 and January 2012 suggests that the top of the cliff is retreating at a higher rate than the base, which is a consequence of excess surface runoff. The aspect of the sea-cliff was also found to have an influence on erosion rates, with higher retreat rates correlating to south facing sea-cliffs. Unless measures are taken to impede the current rate of erosion along Lagoon Road, the road will be undercut in 60 years.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Edward A. Keller,"Bar-built coastal lagoons are common coastal landforms that typically occupy drowned river valleys and exist in wave-dominated areas characterized by seasonal rainfall. Wave-driven sedimentation often seasonally closes the inlet, forming a perched estuary that is separated from the ocean by a sand or gravel beach barrier. The pressure on these systems and their ability to provide important ecosystem services will increase in the 21st century due to climate change, sea-level rise, and continued population growth within their watersheds and estuarine margins. To better understand how coastal lagoons function, this work addressed three main topics: 1) the observed variable patterns of breaching and closure, 2) the beach-barrier groundwater connection, and 3) the role of watershed variability in estuary geomorphology. A hydrologic and geomorphic model of estuary breaching and closure was developed, assessed, and then used to examine how estuarine and beach processes affect the breaching and closure processes. The model is based upon the continuity equation for the estuary water balance, and a geomorphic component for the inlet that incorporates inlet sedimentation by waves and erosion by fluvial processes. The root mean square error of the predicted versus observed estuary stage was 0.45m, 0.39m, and 0.42m for three separate years when the inlet drained directly across the berm, and the model was able to reproduce the initial seasonal breaching, seasonal closure, intermittent closures and breaches, and the low-streamflow (closed state) estuary hydrology of the Carmel Lagoon, located in Central California. Model results show that estuary function (eg amount of time inlet is closed, low-flow hydrology, frequency of breaching) is sensitive to realistic variations in beach berm characteristics (hydraulic conductivity, height, etc.), estuary storage, and especially hydrologic inflow. Sea-level rise will potentially cause the estuary to behave more like a coastal lake. Groundwater and estuarine waterlevel observations indicate that the beach barrier aquifer provides a dynamic hydrologic connection between the ocean and the closed lagoon. Groundwater flow is predominantly oceanward for the conditions observed, and the flux is modulated by tides at all estuary waterlevels, reversing directions only during wave overtopping events that fully saturate the beach. A numerical model of barrier groundwater was calibrated with constrained input parameters and assessed using observed groundwater heads. The model accounts for berm morphology, swash infiltration, wave set-up, and a sloping no-flow bottom boundary. The model accurately reproduces observed groundwater fluctuations (RMSE is 0.062m, 0.074m, 0.022m for three wells), except during wave overtopping events, and model results indicate that the seepage flux (and its variance), groundwater heads, and width of the seepage face are all underpredicted when the topography of the berm is not incorporated into the model. Sensitivity analyses emphasize the importance of wave swash on model performance. Nineteen small, shallow lagoons in a tectonically active, low-wave energy region were mapped and analyzed to determine how watershed processes shape estuary geomorphology. Multiple linear regression analyses indicate that variability in lagoon area, length, volume, average width, circularity, and lagoon width expansion are primarily the result of variability in watershed precipitation and channel slope upstream of the lagoons. The coefficients of determination for the power function regressions are 0.88 (lagoon area), 0.88 (lagoon length), 0.83 (lagoon volume), and 0.74 (average width).",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

More detailed analysis comparing channel widths from Google Earth using the ChanGeom extraction methodology, as developed in this study, with field- and lidar-derived datasets attests to the quality and utility of such methods and provides key information about channel response to tectonic forcings across a host of regimes. Lastly, accurate channel widths are utilized in the Himalaya to derive erosion proxies based on specific stream power estimates and are compared with 60 cosmogenic radionuclide derived erosion rates in the western Himalaya.

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Jordan F. Clark,"California guidelines for recycled water reuse currently give preference to groundwater tracers to determine underground retention time, with a target retention time of >6 months from infiltration to drinking water extraction. Two prospective tracers were evaluated here: boron-10 (10B, the lesser abundant boron stable isotope), and heat (with recharging water warmed at sewage treatment plants and by solar radiation in surface-spreading basins). Bromide (Br-), a conservative deliberate salt tracer with limitations to low-volume settings, was released as a control. Tracer injection occurred when 3 kg of 10B-enriched boric acid and 36 kg of NaBr were added to the research test basin at San Gabriel Spreading Grounds, part of the Montebello Forebay, Los Angeles County, CA, USA. Recycled wastewater was piped directly to this basin at a rate of 2200 m3/day for ~two continuous months. 10B and Br- tracer breakthroughs were observed at seven monitoring wells ranging from directly beneath the basin floor to 150 m downgradient. Travel times ranged from 0.7 to 40 days. Arrival of Br- to each well was always coincident or preceded 10B arrival, reflecting retardation of 10B presumably due to exchange with clay surfaces. 10B/Br - travel time ratios determined from the center of mass ranged from 1 to 1.4. Travel times were successfully determined to all wells. Peak matching of diurnal variations was only possible at the nearest well (<1 day travel time). Basic analysis of temperature measurements, even in the absence of peak matching, yielded a reliable estimate of the underground residence time. Heat has great potential as an intrinsic tracer for managed recharge applications. Based on average tracer travel times, a vertical flow line directly below the test basin had an average vertical velocity of 3.3 m/day, equivalent to a recharge rate of 0.8 m/day.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

California's San Joaquin Valley is both a literal and figurative hotspot for the intersection of impacts created by global climate change and local policies ranging from water management to poverty mitigation. Combining climate change with a region already suffering from environmental degradation and a lackluster program for aiding those who are most socioeconomically vulnerable creates a perfect storm with potentially devastating and wide-reaching consequences.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Global and International Studies",Global and International Studies,Eve Darian-Smith,"One of the pillars in the modern case against capital punishment is the international argument which contends that the abolition of the American death penalty is supported by viewing the practice in the global context. America's legacy of racism, societal demand for tough-on-crime approaches, and political maneuvering around the death penalty have resulted in the United States being one of the only free and democratic countries in the world to practice capital punishment. America's unusual position on this issue cannot be fully understood or challenged without being viewed from an international perspective. The international argument has also become much more popular in recent years, but despite its increase in significance the actual effect this argument on American public opinion has gone virtually untested. The Marshall Hypothesis (that knowledge about the death penalty will reduce support for it) has been measured in terms of the public's receptivity to other important arguments for abolition including racial discrimination, deterrence, and innocence. Each of these arguments and a brief history of the U.S. death penalty debate are described in early chapters in order to provide background for the original research presented in the second half of the thesis. This study adds to the body of research known as ""Testing the Marshall Hypothesis"" by empirically measuring the impact the international argument has on the opinion of adult American students at a public university in California. Using survey data from over 200 students, this research provides data regarding three questions: (1) is student support for capital punishment affected by exposure to international information regarding the death penalty? If so, (2) to what degree is their support affected, and (3) what pieces of information are most or least compelling? The results of the study lend support to the hypotheses that American university students are receptive to the international argument against capital punishment, that the international argument can alter the opinions of American students to varying and sometimes substantial degrees, and that certain facts are more compelling than others in this regard. The quantitative evidence presented in this study supports Justice Marshall's hypothesis and further strengthens the possibility that the international argument could be a notable contributor in shaping public opinion regarding the death penalty in America.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

History",History,Gabriela Soto Laveaga,"This dissertation analyzes public health programs and the reform narratives doctors and state officials produced from 1930 to 1940, along with residents' petitions sent to Cali's municipal council during the same period. Some of the central questions it strives to answer are: what were Liberal reformers striving to do when they set out to implement social programs in public health and sanitation at this time? How did these programs and the public narratives they produced help alter state-society relations in Colombia? And finally, how did local communities use these programs to negotiate with state officials and gain access to the benefits of full social citizenship? In answering these questions, I argue that Liberal reformers used public health, hygiene, and the organization of space as tools to modernize the nation, redefine the state's responsibility to its citizens, and modify or regulate people's everyday habits, customs, and private lives. Teaching workers and peasants how to create habits that promoted their physical wellbeing and allowed them to contribute to national prosperity through their labor and their productive capacities. Liberal reformers argued that the expansion of public health services and implementation of hygiene campaigns were ideal mechanisms to help the state lead the masses in this transformation. As the Liberal party, in power from 1930 to 1946, set out to implement public health programs designed to modernize the nation, foster economic prosperity, and improve the health of its citizens, government officials and the groups these reform efforts targeted sought to define what citizenship, modernity, health, and progress meant for them. Reform narratives provide just one angle to this story. While reformers portrayed workers and peasants at best as passive victims of more than four decades of state neglect at the hands of Conservative regimes, or at worst as stubborn, backward, ignorant, and unruly subjects---the ways local communities responded to state reform efforts complicates this seemingly simple dichotomy. While reformers promoted a brand of modernity that relied on science, education, and state intervention to diagnose, treat, and cure their society, the petitions local residents sent to their council and other municipal officer show that these actors both adopted and challenged the state's official rhetoric. Municipal records show that communities drew from public narratives and reform language to claim their rights, and gain access to the benefits of inclusion into the social body. While some petitioners used current understandings of hygiene, sanitation, modernity, progress, party loyalty, or citizenship to claim their rights and hold local authorities' accountable for solving their grievances, others proposed alternative definitions of these notions. At a time, when the Liberal party continuously emphasized its commitment to extending state power and responsibility in guaranteeing its citizens access to health, sanitation, education, and other social benefits, petitioners' use of a language that resonated with and challenged these public narratives, shows that negotiation is an essential part of state-society relations, and the limits of reform efforts once they are implemented on-the-ground. In their petitions, local residents turned blame away from themselves, and turned it towards the local state, which they argued was ultimately responsible for failing them. This act showed both the state's inability to extend social guarantees to all its citizens, and contradictions in the state's democratizing efforts.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

History",History,Ann Marie Plane,"This dissertation explores how California history museums represent the history of children and childhood. This work is inspired by earlier studies in the fields of anthropology, sociology, museum studies, and public history that question and analyze the underrepresentation or misrepresentation of groups, such as women and ethnic minorities, in US museums. How US museums represent children and their history has yet to receive scholarly attention. This dissertation contributes to filling this gap in the literature and bases its conclusions on a state-wide survey of more than 200 California museums, interviews with 110 museum professionals or volunteers, site visits to 40 museums, and in-depth field research at 10 museums. I argue that too often the experiences, stories, and contributions of children are overlooked, absent, or marginalized in California history museums. When representations of children's history do emerge, they often reflect ideals rather than realities, universalize the historical experience of childhood, and, in the process, romanticize the past. This dissertation acknowledges obstacles that get in the way of richer representation and offers potential solutions. During my study it became clear that multiple meanings of children's history are at work in the California museum community: the history of children, history for children, and history by children. This dissertation examines each in turn and demonstrates how conceptions of children, many with deep historical roots, influence not only museum exhibitions but also programming for children. Central to this dissertation is the study of history by children at the Pasadena Museum of History, which provides middle-school students the opportunity to teach history as docents to younger children. Drawing upon my three years of participant observation at this site and interviews with forty middle-school students, I contend that inviting children to participate, create, and co-produce in museum spaces improves children's attitudes towards museums, enriches representation, and brings to light perspectives that may otherwise remain marginalized.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

History",History,Mario T. Garcia,"The history of race, politics, and civil rights in California's Central Valley is an important yet understudied aspect of multiracial history in the American West. Kern County and the city of Bakersfield were critical epicenters of civil rights activism during the twentieth century. Simultaneously, an equally active and sometimes hostile, conservative resistance toward labor and civil rights existed in the region. In the immediate post-World War II era, Mexican Americans built racial coalitions with African Americans and white liberals to challenge racial segregation and discrimination in housing and employment. In the ensuing decades, the war on poverty, farmworker, and Chicana/o power movements impacted racial coalition building and civil rights reform in complex ways, including struggles over increased political representation for racial minorities, expansion of rural-migrant health care, and school desegregation. Since World War II through the rise of the modern political right, Mexican immigrants and their descendants shaped rural and urban civil rights reform in California's interior. This dissertation draws upon several archival repositories related to labor and civil rights history in California's Central Valley, including the collected papers of the United Farm Workers (UFW), the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF), the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Region I, West Coast Branch (NAACP-WC), the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), as well as previously unexamined personal paper collections of Bakersfield civil rights leaders and politicians. Referred to pejoratively as ""Mississippi West"", given the county's vibrant history of civil rights activism and antistatist opposition toward civil rights, Kern County is ground-zero for a massive demographic transformation from a white to Hispanic majority; a trend other U.S. regions will experience in the coming decades.

It does so by examining connections between racism during the twentieth century and the historical and ideological legacy of Westward expansion. Frontier mores, such as violence, individualism, masculinity, and landownership, that justified Indian removal in the United States during the nineteenth century continued to inform racial prejudice in the Southwest well into the twentieth century.

History",History,Patricia Cline Cohen,"This dissertation addresses the critically under-studied topic of fatherhood in U.S. History. Using an array of evidence from newspapers, demographic data (including California's controversial 1852 state census), and a variety of eyewitness accounts, it describes the experiences of San Francisco's nineteenth and early twentieth-century fathers and demonstrates how the ambitions and actions of fathers as fathers helped stimulate historical change. Along the way it re-evaluates historians' understanding of gender demographics in early San Francisco, including the misperception that a large number of women were prostitutes. The dissertation employs portrayals of two archetypal San Francisco fathers as paradigms to illuminate the lives of most fathers in San Francisco during the period. James King of William was a crusading newspaper editor whose aggressive editorial voice demanded reform so that Gold Rush era San Francisco could become a place where families could prosper in safety. His influence stimulated the revolution fomented by the 1856 San Francisco Committee of Vigilance, a revolution that influenced the city's political and social order into the twentieth century. Hubert Howe Bancroft was a businessman and noted historian. His activities as a businessman helped shape the economy of California, while his activities as a historian literally made the history of the region. The study shows that Bancroft linked all his activities to his ambitions for the welfare of his family. King and Bancroft were burgher patriarchs, men who built their lives around their roles as protectors of and providers for their families. Much more than mere breadwinners, such men occupied an active and influential position at the heart of their families. The changes burgher patriarchs wrought in nineteenth-century San Francisco on behalf of their families led to social and economic shifts at the beginning of the twentieth century that turned fathers away from burgher patriarchy. These changes included a growing consumer culture, the bureaucratization of enterprise, and the expropriation of many parental duties by state and social organizations. Increasingly, fathers gained status strictly from their success as breadwinners. Their focus became work and career. Their influence within the family faded, and the dominance of burgher patriarchy ended.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

In the immediate post-World War II era, Mexican Americans built racial coalitions with African Americans and white liberals to challenge racial segregation and discrimination in housing and employment. In the ensuing decades, the war on poverty, farmworker, and Chicana/o power movements impacted racial coalition building and civil rights reform in complex ways, including struggles over increased political representation for racial minorities, expansion of rural-migrant health care, and school desegregation. Since World War II through the rise of the modern political right, Mexican immigrants and their descendants shaped rural and urban civil rights reform in California's interior. This dissertation draws upon several archival repositories related to labor and civil rights history in California's Central Valley, including the collected papers of the United Farm Workers (UFW), the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF), the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Region I, West Coast Branch (NAACP-WC), the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), as well as previously unexamined personal paper collections of Bakersfield civil rights leaders and politicians. Referred to pejoratively as ""Mississippi West"", given the county's vibrant history of civil rights activism and antistatist opposition toward civil rights, Kern County is ground-zero for a massive demographic transformation from a white to Hispanic majority; a trend other U.S. regions will experience in the coming decades. The history of race relations, civil rights, and politics in the region sheds light on the importance of a burgeoning Latino population, as well as marks a bellwether for future U.S. social and political trends in California and beyond.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

History",History,Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval,"This study uncovers the roots of racism in the Southwest during the first half of the twentieth century and explores how racism affected people of color. It does so by examining connections between racism during the twentieth century and the historical and ideological legacy of Westward expansion. Frontier mores, such as violence, individualism, masculinity, and landownership, that justified Indian removal in the United States during the nineteenth century continued to inform racial prejudice in the Southwest well into the twentieth century. In the context of racial prejudice, this dissertation examines the experiences of people of color who lived, worked, and farmed in Imperial Valley, California. It delves into the complexities of race relations and racial prejudices within a multiplicity of racial groups in the Valley. In doing so, this study goes beyond the Black-white and Mexican-white binaries and investigates racism in the context of a pattern of ethnic and racial succession that included Yuma Indians, Japanese, Punjabis, Mexicans, Filipinos, and white Dust Bowl migrants. Within this multiethnic approach, it emphasizes the contributions of Yuma Indians during the beginnings of industrialized agriculture in the Valley and examines their experiences alongside those of Mexicans and whites. Moreover, this dissertation develops a new perspective on race relations by addressing the conflicts people of color experiences within their own ethnic and/or racial group, in particular, the turmoil that existed within the Japanese and Punjabi communities. They confronted racial prejudice in the larger white community while grappling with dysfunction within their respective racial and/or ethnic group. This study probes the strikes that swept the Valley during the Great Depression and asks how the values which emerged during the expansion of the West informed the violent practices and rhetoric large growers employed. Finally, this work addresses how frontierism promoted white supremacy during World War II as white citizens blamed interethnic violence, racial tensions, and poor moral values on the proximity of the U.S.-Mexico border. The border took on a deeply racialized meaning in the Valley as whites upheld the hierarchal and unequal power dynamic which harkened back to the arrival of the first colonists.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

History",History,Patricia Cline Cohen,"This dissertation addresses the critically under-studied topic of fatherhood in U.S. History. Using an array of evidence from newspapers, demographic data (including California's controversial 1852 state census), and a variety of eyewitness accounts, it describes the experiences of San Francisco's nineteenth and early twentieth-century fathers and demonstrates how the ambitions and actions of fathers as fathers helped stimulate historical change. Along the way it re-evaluates historians' understanding of gender demographics in early San Francisco, including the misperception that a large number of women were prostitutes. The dissertation employs portrayals of two archetypal San Francisco fathers as paradigms to illuminate the lives of most fathers in San Francisco during the period. James King of William was a crusading newspaper editor whose aggressive editorial voice demanded reform so that Gold Rush era San Francisco could become a place where families could prosper in safety. His influence stimulated the revolution fomented by the 1856 San Francisco Committee of Vigilance, a revolution that influenced the city's political and social order into the twentieth century. Hubert Howe Bancroft was a businessman and noted historian. His activities as a businessman helped shape the economy of California, while his activities as a historian literally made the history of the region. The study shows that Bancroft linked all his activities to his ambitions for the welfare of his family. King and Bancroft were burgher patriarchs, men who built their lives around their roles as protectors of and providers for their families. Much more than mere breadwinners, such men occupied an active and influential position at the heart of their families. The changes burgher patriarchs wrought in nineteenth-century San Francisco on behalf of their families led to social and economic shifts at the beginning of the twentieth century that turned fathers away from burgher patriarchy. These changes included a growing consumer culture, the bureaucratization of enterprise, and the expropriation of many parental duties by state and social organizations. Increasingly, fathers gained status strictly from their success as breadwinners. Their focus became work and career. Their influence within the family faded, and the dominance of burgher patriarchy ended.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Linguistics",Linguistics,Mary Bucholtz,"The underrepresentation of women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields is well-documented and enduring (Huang et al. 2000; National Science Foundation 2004, 2011), particularly in fields that require extensive mathematical training (Ceci & Williams 2010). Attempts to identify the source of the gender gap have indicated that causes range from interactional (Bergvall & Remlinger 1996) to institutional (Moss-Racusin 2012). Some research has suggested that the perception of STEM fields as ""unfeminine"" reduces young girls' interest in them. This idea positions expert STEM identities as at odds and incompatible with feminine identities (Thomas-Hunt & Philips 2004). Using data from a large ethnographic study on the cultural and linguistic practices of high-achieving math and science undergraduates at a public university in Southern California, this thesis argues that mathematical expertise can indeed be enacted along with a range of feminine personae. Focusing on three female students who regularly show expertise in their small peer groups in a multivariable calculus course, I argue that each woman enacts expertise while performing different gendered styles. One student claims a more traditional nerd girl identity, eschewing slang and traditional forms of feminine material self-presentation and using a formal mathematical register and unmarked intonation. The second student, while often forceful that she is right, employs a marked nasal whiny intonation when contesting the teaching assistant's decisions and advice, constructing a kind of childlike cute femininity. The third student enacts expertise within her otherwise all-male peer group, and physically presents herself as more emblematic of youthful, middle-class femininity while employin non-interrogative rising intonation, a practice often ideologically seen as feminine. This study shows that a range of feminine styles is not incompatible with expert STEM identities. This research implies that for STEM educators concerned with gender equity, by recognizing that expertise can be accompanied by any kind of gendered persona, women should be encouraged to explore career paths in STEM fields without feeling that they need to conform to a certain type of feminine style.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Linguistics",Linguistics,Matthew Gordon,"Lateral and rhotic consonants have been known to pattern together as liquids since the Ancient Greek grammarian Dionysius Thrax (Walsh 1997; Proctor 2009). Synchronic and diachronic processes which affect one liquid in a language are likely to affect all liquids in the language. The English rhotic [r\\] has been shown to epenthesize in post-vocalic environments, such as in idear or drawring, a phenomenon known as intrusive-R. This rhotic also lenites in other dialects in words like quart and mother (Gick 1999). In parallel, the English lateral [l] may be epenthesized in a rarer, but documented, phenomenon known as intrusive-L, which affects the same environments as intrusive-R (Gick 2002). Similarly, coda-L is optionally pronounced in some words such as folk, palm, and calm, suggesting a similar process of lenition. While it is well-established that the English rhotic [r/] may serve as the syllable peak in certain words such as church, bird, and verb, little work as investigated the possibility of a lateral syllable peak in analogous words such as milk, filled, and help. The current study examines coda-position liquids in closed syllables from native California speakers in the Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English (Du Bois et al. 2000, 2003, 2004, 2005) to create a model predicting liquid sonority based on liquid type, speaker gender, lexical stress, and other phonological features. Additionally, following MRI work by Gick et al. (2002), the formant values of liquids are examined to determine the similarity of liquids to vowels and the influence adjacent vowels may have on the shape of a liquid. Given that coda-position [r/] may be the syllable peak in certain closed syllables, we expect coda-position [l] to behave similarly. Finally, since the findings of Gick et al. (2002) suggest that the articulation of /r// and /l/ are most similar to /[schwa]/ and /[open o]/, respectively, it is predicted that the formant structure of these sonorous liquids will mirror the formant structure of these two vowels. The results indicate that liquids in Californian English exhibit similar patterns regarding sonority under certain conditions, although rhotics may be more vowel-like than laterals.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Religious Studies",Religious Studies,Ahmad A. Ahmad,"This epistemological framework constructed by al-Juwayni in his Burhan is pushed to the limits in his Ghiyathi where he envisions the complete disintegration and dismantling of the Caliphate and its subsidiary institutions in toto. As opposed to envisioning complete chaos al-Juwayni argues for the continuity of society based on religious knowledge which is ingrained in the individual and buttressed by a Shari'a based custom through collective action. For al-Juwayni the complete absence of society is only possible when Shari'a knowledge is completely eradicated from individual and collective memory. In this way, al-Juwayni articulates a more expansive notion of the Shari'a which is responsive to religious, political and social change and continuously acts as a governing force in the lives of the people to adhere to it. As a corollary, the Shari'a more than a static body of laws is a mechanism of governance which transcends any formal apparatus of government and is able to ensure societal continuity in the absence of the latter. Through this dissertation the reader will be exposed to the syncretic nature of al-Juwayni's scholarship which combines different disciplinary inquiries in a unique way in order to fulfill al-Juwayni's two pronged desire for certainty and continuity. Living during a time of intellectual and political upheaval, al-Juwayni's ideas are both alarmingly practical and prescient. For scholars today still grappling with the Shari'a, its future, and prospects for reform, al-Juwayni's thoughts will provide a window into the ways in which classical legal scholars grappled with similar dilemmas. Abu Ma'ali al-Juwayni was one of the most celebrated jurists and theologians of the 5th/11th century and left behind him an extensive oeuvre on topics ranging from the etiquettes of disputation and theology to comparative law and jurisprudence. His scholarly production has thus far not been adequately matched with any comprehensive study that moves beyond an analysis of a singular work. This dissertation aims to fulfill this lacuna by surveying his primary texts to unfurl his scholarly commitments and preoccupations. Through an investigation specifically into al-Juwayni's Burhan Us&dotbelow;ul ul-Fiqh and Ghiyath al-Umam, it becomes clear that al-Juwayni is continuously balancing between his desire for certainty in both theological and legal matters, and his desire to preserve the future of the believing Muslim community irrespective of social, religious and political flux. al-Juwayni is able to do this by proposing a new epistemology which affirms the cognitive capabilities of the individual and creates a framework through which the individual can have practical certainty in their affairs even if ontological certainty remains precluded. Once al-Juwayni establishes this, he is able to argue that regardless of religious and social change external to the individual, the internal knowledge which has become practically certain remains preserved.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

In order to more fully explore the meanings of pan-Indian and trans-Indigenous exchange, I turn to the field of Religion and Healing in Native America. The openness and welcoming of non-natives into native-controlled ceremonial spaces can be explained through an analytic of healing. Accordingly, I argue that native people have identified colonization as a pathology, both mentally and socially, from which both colonizing and colonized populations must recover. The sacred space invoked by Native American spirituality creates decolonizing spaces for the diverse multi-racial participants in that they seek to reinforce an indigenous model of knowledge and practice that resists assimilation. Community ceremonies, such as sweat lodges, function as a hub for the exchange of knowledge and for the healing of individuals and for the group as a whole. Finally, I explore the logics of contestation to change and adaptation within the ceremonies themselves. Tension inevitably arises between fidelity to a sacred tradition and adaptations deemed necessary by the change in context from reservation to diverse city. In these cases, racial identity determines religious authority, where those with a greater degree of perceived ""Indianness"" express more freedom to improvise and adapt in challenging conditions. Whereas among those without biological claim to an indigenous identity, emphasis is centered around performing and interpreting the traditional protocol in a strict manner. This case study in an American Indian urban diaspora community proposes a new model of indigeneity incorporating outsiders, extending the religious boundary, and circulating knowledge without losing an authentic connection to tradition and homeland. In 2014, more than 70% of American Indians live in urban areas away from reservations. This dissertation employs theoretical work on diaspora religion to interpret the effects on spiritual practices of the displacement of Native Americans to cities since the mid-20th century. Using the framework of an urban diaspora, I argue that the split geographical situation results in a center-satellite formation of pan-Indian religion in which Lakota practices are dominant. Employing ethnographic fieldwork among a diverse group practicing Native American spirituality in Ventura County, California, I argue that such urban spiritual networks balance competing forces of indigenizing versus extending within the larger pan-Indian religious community. That is, as Lakota spiritual practices were gradually opened to non-Lakota, and even non-Indian, outsiders, the traditional protocols that govern the ceremonial structure have become more important in ensuring the continuance of an authorized, traditional religion. I trace the logic of assimilation through the relevant history of Native American forced dislocations and urbanization---from 19th century removal policies, prisoner-of- war camps, to compulsory boarding schools for Indian youth, to the Termination and ix Relocation policies of the United States government in the decades after World War II. These migrations and policies of de-culturization contribute to the historical context for a study of mixed-blood natives and non-natives practicing intertribal, Lakota-based spirituality in coastal California from the 1970's to the present.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Religious Studies",Religious Studies,Wade Clark Roof,"The 2008 election season brought a new fame to the otherwise ignored Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints. The presidential campaign of Mitt Romney and the Church's tireless efforts in passing Proposition 8 in California showed signs of a more energized, aggressive involvement of the Saints within public political discourse. However, from the beginning it was clear there was ambivalence from Evangelicals and other Protestant Christians in aligning with them in support of both causes. Glenn Beck's rise in the media from 2008 to the present marks an unprecedented national mainstreaming of a peculiar brand of religious political conservatism rooted in, and once isolated to, the Mormon culture that traditionally existed in the margins. Beck, a Mormon convert, successfully created a popular narrative for political change buttressed by his Mormon ideology but was packaged for an Evangelical Christian audience. Paradoxically, Beck employs rhetoric where the principles that have historically cast the Mormons as religious ""outsiders"" are now the points that are serving to unify Mormons with mainstream Christians today. That is to say, Beck's influence on the Tea Party infuses a particularly Mormon characteristic within the framework of contemporary conservatism, the consequence of which is profound. This thesis will examine, first, the principles of the Mormon faith that serve as points of unity between Mormons and Evangelicals, namely, the doctrines of restoration, revelation, and eternal family. Then, a close examination of Beck in his various media (television, radio, public rallies, and books) reveals the overt Mormon message that is instilled within his ideology even as it is re-framed in terms more acceptable to non-Mormon conservatives. Finally, I address the timeliness of Beck's popularity, and how the mainstreaming of the Mormons comes out of an affinity with a growing rhetoric of persecution from conservative Christians. I focus on rhetoric of Beck to understand how the Mormons have influenced and affected the broad scope of conservatism, which suggests the historical distinction made between Mormons and Evangelicals is merely pretense.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Religious Studies",Religious Studies,Catherine L. Albanese,"This dissertation addresses the question: how can we make sense of secularization in the United States? The approach I adopt here is to consider secularization as the loss of religious leaders' authority to interpret controversial issues and to have a direct impact on local, state, and federal laws, regulations, policies, and procedures. I focus on religious leaders' responses to prostitution in San Francisco, California, during the years 1848-1917. Investigation involved reviewing primary source materials from archival repositories across the country. Some generalizations can be made about San Francisco religious leaders' responses to prostitution in terms of their respective religious traditions or communities. Protestant leaders sought to address causes of prostitution and to reform prostitutes. Catholic leaders attempted to remove prostitutes from public view. Jewish leaders addressed prostitution both in terms of public health and also in answer to fears about illegal international slavery operations. Responses in Chinatown included both innovations on popular religious practices from China that afforded prostitutes a recognized place in temple life, as well as Protestant missions that sought to reform prostitutes in ways that were partially adopted by Chinatown residents themselves. These responses varied in the degree to which they directly sought to change public policy. When direct engagement was attempted, religious leaders were frequently surprised at their inability to have an impact on city and state policies. This development can be seen as an illustration of secularization in San Francisco. Furthermore, I suggest that San Francisco religious leaders' lack of authority regarding prostitution can be explained in terms of local developments in labor and gender roles that occurred in the wake of the California Gold Rush. Similar developments were not evidenced in other parts of the United States until decades later, towards the close of the nineteenth century. This suggests that, at least with regard to issues related to prostitution, San Francisco secularized earlier than other parts of the country. Whether it makes sense to make broader claims about San Francisco's early secularization would require additional investigation into local religious leaders' responses to other controversial issues of the day.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Religious Studies",Religious Studies,Kathleen Moore,"On January 9, 1961, Folsom State Prison inmate Jesse L.

Ferguson, a member of the Nation of Islam, alleged that prison administrators had denied Muslim inmates the right to freely practice their religion, violating their constitutionally guaranteed rights. In his defense, however, Director of Corrections, Robert A. McGee, argued that the Muslim inmates' ""quasi-religion"" posed a significant threat to the health, safety, and welfare of correctional facilities, inmates, and staff. In this thesis I examine the case documents, analyzing the context and content of In re Ferguson with the aim of explicating the arguments made before the court and situating them in a broader historical narrative. The Ferguson case reflects many of the religious and judicial debates of the 1950s and 1960s. These debates had a significant impact on the Nation of Islam's legal status in prisons and the extent to which constitutional protections of incarcerated members' religious rights applied.

Religious Studies",Religious Studies,Ines Talamantez,"In addition, I interrogate categories of analysis in popular use, such as ""Indian"" and ""Indigenous Religion"", in order to arrive at a more nuanced understanding of the competing claims of biological race, cultural hybridity, and a history of forced assimilation upon native identifications. In order to more fully explore the meanings of pan-Indian and trans-Indigenous exchange, I turn to the field of Religion and Healing in Native America. The openness and welcoming of non-natives into native-controlled ceremonial spaces can be explained through an analytic of healing. Accordingly, I argue that native people have identified colonization as a pathology, both mentally and socially, from which both colonizing and colonized populations must recover. The sacred space invoked by Native American spirituality creates decolonizing spaces for the diverse multi-racial participants in that they seek to reinforce an indigenous model of knowledge and practice that resists assimilation. Community ceremonies, such as sweat lodges, function as a hub for the exchange of knowledge and for the healing of individuals and for the group as a whole. Finally, I explore the logics of contestation to change and adaptation within the ceremonies themselves. Tension inevitably arises between fidelity to a sacred tradition and adaptations deemed necessary by the change in context from reservation to diverse city. In these cases, racial identity determines religious authority, where those with a greater degree of perceived ""Indianness"" express more freedom to improvise and adapt in challenging conditions. Whereas among those without biological claim to an indigenous identity, emphasis is centered around performing and interpreting the traditional protocol in a strict manner. This case study in an American Indian urban diaspora community proposes a new model of indigeneity incorporating outsiders, extending the religious boundary, and circulating knowledge without losing an authentic connection to tradition and homeland. In 2014, more than 70% of American Indians live in urban areas away from reservations. This dissertation employs theoretical work on diaspora religion to interpret the effects on spiritual practices of the displacement of Native Americans to cities since the mid-20th century. Using the framework of an urban diaspora, I argue that the split geographical situation results in a center-satellite formation of pan-Indian religion in which Lakota practices are dominant. Employing ethnographic fieldwork among a diverse group practicing Native American spirituality in Ventura County, California, I argue that such urban spiritual networks balance competing forces of indigenizing versus extending within the larger pan-Indian religious community. That is, as Lakota spiritual practices were gradually opened to non-Lakota, and even non-Indian, outsiders, the traditional protocols that govern the ceremonial structure have become more important in ensuring the continuance of an authorized, traditional religion. I trace the logic of assimilation through the relevant history of Native American forced dislocations and urbanization---from 19th century removal policies, prisoner-of- war camps, to compulsory boarding schools for Indian youth, to the Termination and ix Relocation policies of the United States government in the decades after World War II. These migrations and policies of de-culturization contribute to the historical context for a study of mixed-blood natives and non-natives practicing intertribal, Lakota-based spirituality in coastal California from the 1970's to the present.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Religious Studies",Religious Studies,Catherine L. Albanese,"This dissertation addresses the question: how can we make sense of secularization in the United States? The approach I adopt here is to consider secularization as the loss of religious leaders' authority to interpret controversial issues and to have a direct impact on local, state, and federal laws, regulations, policies, and procedures. I focus on religious leaders' responses to prostitution in San Francisco, California, during the years 1848-1917. Investigation involved reviewing primary source materials from archival repositories across the country. Some generalizations can be made about San Francisco religious leaders' responses to prostitution in terms of their respective religious traditions or communities. Protestant leaders sought to address causes of prostitution and to reform prostitutes. Catholic leaders attempted to remove prostitutes from public view. Jewish leaders addressed prostitution both in terms of public health and also in answer to fears about illegal international slavery operations. Responses in Chinatown included both innovations on popular religious practices from China that afforded prostitutes a recognized place in temple life, as well as Protestant missions that sought to reform prostitutes in ways that were partially adopted by Chinatown residents themselves. These responses varied in the degree to which they directly sought to change public policy. When direct engagement was attempted, religious leaders were frequently surprised at their inability to have an impact on city and state policies. This development can be seen as an illustration of secularization in San Francisco. Furthermore, I suggest that San Francisco religious leaders' lack of authority regarding prostitution can be explained in terms of local developments in labor and gender roles that occurred in the wake of the California Gold Rush. Similar developments were not evidenced in other parts of the United States until decades later, towards the close of the nineteenth century. This suggests that, at least with regard to issues related to prostitution, San Francisco secularized earlier than other parts of the country. Whether it makes sense to make broader claims about San Francisco's early secularization would require additional investigation into local religious leaders' responses to other controversial issues of the day.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Through interviews with 53 queer students and over 100 hours of participant observation at community events, I examined the identity-based processes that students used to define and enact queerness at the individual and group levels, and found that white normative standards pervaded queer ideologies and practices in this site. Commitment to inclusion was a central component of queer identity among students but the methods of inclusion valued and promoted in this community often resulted in the re-marginalization of queer of color students for whom a queer person of color (QPOC) identity marked them as a distinct subset of the queer student population. This research contributes to our understanding of identity processes and conflict within diverse social movements through incorporation of social movement, structural identity, and critical race theories to understand the complex identity-based investments of individuals who are members of diverse social justice communities. This research is an investigation into how queer students at the University of California, Santa Barbara constructed and reinforced solidarity among variously identified members of the queer community. More specifically, this research examines the significance of inclusion as a core ideological component of queer group and social identities on this campus and the racialized frames through which students conceived of inclusive queer politics.

Sociology",Sociology,Maria Charles,"With regards to the work itself, private and personal cheffing seem to open doors for some individuals (i.e. women, parents, older adults) who might not otherwise enter or stay in the culinary profession. However, chefs may face discriminatory hiring practices in private employment, and ultimately, these fields may actually contribute to the (re)production of gender segregation within the culinary profession. Women outnumber men as personal chefs, a field with relatively low status and earnings (though this varies), while many of the men in my study seemed to treat private/personal cheffing as a springboard towards work with higher pay, status, and visibility. Tensions between selves, or between the material and ""moral"" spheres of life, contributed to many participants' decisions to pursue private/personal cheffing. Engaging in what I call ""self-directed boundary work"", they recognized a discrepancy between who they were prior to the career move and their ""true"" or hoped-for self. Most of my participants are satisfied with the change; they have taken a stand against overly demanding, inflexible, and/or personally meaningless work. However, not everyone has the opportunity or resources to engage in this kind of self-change. Furthermore, because social forces shape (and limit) our ideas about who we are, making decisions based on these self-conceptions has the potential to reproduce social inequalities. This dissertation examines how private and personal chefs manage tensions about their identity and status. It draws primarily on interviews with private and personal chefs in California, along with a nationwide survey of personal chefs. Both types of chefs work in and for private households, though typically private chefs are employed by one household while personal chefs are self-employed and offer a range of services (e.g. prepared meals, dinner parties, cooking classes). These chefs are emblematic of several recent changes in American work and culture, and they are also very ambiguously positioned with regards to both their societal and intraprofessional status. Located somewhere between chefs (looked highly upon today) and domestic workers, private/personal chefs could be seen as artists or as menial and subordinate laborers. Moreover, most of these chefs are white and/or native born, middle-class, and highly educated, while domestic workers are usually foreign-born women of color. In order to respond to these tensions, the chefs draw symbolic boundaries (i.e. engage in ""boundary work""), asserting their worth and declaring who they are and are not. Some of the chefs' boundary work challenges existing hierarchies and inequalities. They distinguish themselves from restaurant chefs, for instance, and contest the culinary profession's typical status hierarchy. They also criticize clients who act as if they are entitled to the chefs' services. More commonly, their boundary work reinforces societal and occupational hierarchies. Beliefs about the worth of individuals based on their gender, race, or class often underlie their distinctions. By distancing themselves from home cooks and domestic servants, for example, they reinforce the devaluation of household reproductive labor and those who typically perform it. Some chefs also express a preference for clients with ""good"" taste, legitimating class-based cultural distinctions. This dissertation clearly illustrates our ambivalence towards care(work). Household reproductive labor continues to be devalued. Yet, a need to care for oneself and others motivated changes in career paths, and caring for others was a widely shared source of satisfaction with the work. This study points to the need to start treating care as a social responsibility -- the need to start tearing down boundaries rather than drawing them.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Ten smart growth projects (SGPs) in four cities within California and Oregon were identified and semi-structured interviews were held with the respective developers, architects and civic officials, who were involved in the implementation process. Comparative, descriptive and grounded approaches were used to generate themes from interviews and other data sources. The dissertation culminates with a concluding chapter that briefly assesses the findings and their implications for social science, economic practice, and public policy. American urban development is characterized by urban sprawl: the low-density, single-family housing and separated land uses that are dependent on automobile transportation. Sprawl has negative affects for the environment and for social health. In the last twenty years, planners and developers have adopted smart growth principles. Smart growth is a land-use philosophy and practice that promotes higher density housing, mixed-use neighborhoods, more open spaces, transit alternatives to the automobile, and social equity through mixed-income neighborhoods. It is viewed as an alternative to sprawl. The research project first examines the structural and cultural features of communities that both support and oppose smart growth development. This dissertation then examines whether or not smart growth represents a break from the practices of conventional urban development, long theorized as a growth machine. The growth machine describes the collusion of land-use interests with local government to direct economic growth. The purpose of this inquiry is to determine if there is an empirically distinct smart growth machine.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Sociology",Sociology,Richard Flacks,"Individual activists transition relatively freely between ""movement activism"" and ""party activism"" in order to achieve their larger goals. Political parties are also shaped by the activity of social movement groups and organizations within their structures. Recent changes in the style and organization of political campaigns have produced further convergences between movement and party organizations. This has been the case in California, where several waves of movement and grassroots activists have successfully pushed for greater participatory opportunities within the Party and stronger commitments to core values. Surprisingly, the data suggest that movement activity in the CDP may have helped to strengthen the Party's ability to better fulfil its traditional political functions, despite the well-documented hostility to party prerogatives that characterize California's political culture and electoral system. Sociologists have often defined social movement activity against other, more institutional forms of political engagement, including activism in political parties. This dissertation attempts to develop a more flexible, organic and systemic understanding of the relationship between movements and parties by examining the impact of social movements on the California Democratic Party (CDP). The research is based in participant observation of the Party's activity at all levels, data from a 2011 survey of 524 CDP convention delegates (out of a total of 2556), as well as interviews with current and past CDP leaders, activists and staff. The findings are contextualized in a broad, historical narrative of structural and cultural change surrounding the Democratic Party nationally. Despite the theoretical division between movements and parties, this study finds significant overlap between these two forms of political activity. In a context in which party organizations' role in politics is heavily circumscribed, CDP leaders and activists have created an organization that is both effective electorally as well as comparatively independent and participatory. That social movements and movement activists have played a role in the narrative of conflict and cooperation that produced this outcome is significant---both for scholars interested in the impact of movements on institutional politics, as well as students of political parties interested in preserving or expanding the crucial role they play in modern democracies.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

In this dissertation, I argue that U.S. feminism is currently in abeyance and that educational institutions are generative environments for abeyance structures. Drawing on theories of women's movements, student movements, and movements inside institutions, I provide a systematic updating of abeyance theory. The study's design is comparative: the three field sites are Smith College, the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities and the University of California-Santa Barbara, which are not only in three different regions of the U.S. but also have diverse student demographics and activist cultures. I employ both qualitative and quantitative methods and include semi-structured interviews (n=75), participant observation, and a survey of college students on each campus (n=1,400). I highlight three variable dimensions that help us understand the unique nature of social movements in abeyance: fields of contention, collective identity, and tactical repertoires. I argue that during periods in which mobilized participants have little support: a) institutions of higher education provide welcome environments for feminist mobilization, often in unexpected locations such as multi-cultural sororities and student government; b) feminist collective identities nest or ""spill over"" to influence other social movements including queer, anti-racist, and anti-fee hike organizations; and c) tactics move on-line, especially to social networking sites.

Drawing upon digital videos from the University of California, Santa Barbara's vast collection of naturally occurring interactions, cases in which the aforementioned practice occurs were identified, collected, and analyzed using the established methods of conversation analysis. Self-formulations of embodied actions were found in one of three sequential positions relative to the actions they explicate: before the commission of an action, after its completion or abandonment, or while an action was still underway. Generally, self-formulations either serve as a prophylactic against potential trouble or in response to trouble that has actually transpired. Self-formulations provide recipients with an ""official account"" of what a person is about to do, has done (or tried to do), or is involved with doing.

Sociology",Sociology,Fernando Lopez-Alves,"The local food movement offers the simple premise that changing the way we eat can change the world. As the global adoption of neoliberal practices has encouraged the ""privatization of survival,"" where states deregulate, sell, and commodify social services once provided for free or at low cost, people without monetary means to access them have gone into debt or gone without. This reduction in public services, rising unemployment rates, soaring fuel and food costs, and a ""race to the bottom in food"" production that makes food less nutritious and less safe, have made more people unable to provide for basic needs and consume healthy food. Additionally, as neoliberal policies have triggered extreme economic inequality, acute difficulties meeting basic needs, and the erosion of political representation, people have responded by rejecting globalization outright or attempting to guide it down a more sustainable path. To better understand the nature of such responses to globalization, where the local food movement fits in, and how urban agriculture efforts in Detroit, Flint, and Ypsilanti are unique, this project documents how the local food movement seeks to relocalize the economy and adopt more sustainable consumption practices to counter the economic inequality, resource scarcity, and social fragmentation exacerbated by neoliberal policies and practices.

Sociology",Sociology,Howard Winant,"This dissertation, entitled ""Agency and Action: Immigrant Lives and Immigrant Politics in the Deportation Nation,"" examines the ways in which undocumented Mexican immigrants manage and contest the threat of apprehension and deportation in two communities in California. This project employs a comparative ethnographic approach, including in depth interviews with 61 immigrant respondents in two cities in one county and participant observation in both places over the course of three years. In this study, I make three interrelated arguments: First, the ""post-border"" turn in immigration enforcement demonstrates that the state has geographically displaced but not resolved a growing contradiction between neoliberal economic demands for the free movement of capital and competing national security demands for control over the movement of people. Second, I argue that the increasingly local character of immigration enforcement renders it susceptible to local political climates; this both opens up and closes down avenues to greater inclusion for immigrant communities. Various structural conditions and biographical idiosyncrasies increase or decrease the likelihood of four types of immigrant resistance: avoidance/insulation, ""everyday"" resistance, advocacy, and collective mobilization. Third, at the level of subjectivity, I characterize immigrants who engage in political activism as ""instrumental activists"": willing to participate in social movement organizing, not out of a generalized commitment to social justice, but motivated by material and mundane desires for the betterment of self and family that largely align with largely normative visions of work and family life. Earlier studies of immigration have focused on the mechanisms of social control that circumscribe the life chances of immigrants. In this dissertation, I take a different tack and examine the forms of agency within immigrant communities as people manage intensified risks in their daily lives. While there is a growing literature examining various forms of immigrant agency, these studies tend to focus on only one type of immigrant agency, producing varied empirical portraits of the efficacy and impact of immigrant agency and political activity. I explicitly examine the relationships among four different types of immigrant agency in order to examine the biographical idiosyncrasies and structural conditions that influence the form that immigrant agency will take. These developments raise important questions about shifting forms of state power, the status of race relations in the U.S., and the place of immigrants in liberal democratic and capitalist societies.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

These differences are rendered invisible to many research methods because contemporary American culture treats trees with automatic hagiographic respect. Direct questioning, through survey research or traditional interviewing, will reveal only the superficial respect given to trees. More creative interview methods, along with a close reading of the way trees are treated in popular culture, reveal the divergent sensibilities that use arboreal language as a way to understand and give meaning to the relationship between humans and the physical world. Interviews were conducted in public urban and forested areas in California, Kansas, and New York and complemented by hermeneutic analysis of tree imagery in Christmas decorations, advertising, and landscape. Each interview revolved around the infamous 'If you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be?' question made popular by Barbara Walters. The methods, interviews and analysis employed reveal just how many faux-environmentalist sensibilities rely on the idea, image, and planting of trees. When the tree is worshiped, uncritically, as a balm for all the ills of the modern world, it denies ecological thinking. The romanticization of the tree is dangerous because it usurps trees from the plant kingdom and uses them to redecorate and remodel urban environments. Trees are a counter-narrative to modernity, but a failed counter-narrative, an evil detournement. Within these discourses, however, is another sensibility, suggesting ways that even a tree-based rhetoric can shift into a more holistic ecological approach that can eliminate the delineation of nature, as non-man, into a vision of an ecology that permeates the urban and rural Earth.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Sociology",Sociology,"G. Reginald Daniel, Denise A. Segura","Extensive theoretical and empirical research on the subject of racial/ethnic identity among multiracial (i.e. ""mixed race"") populations has yielded several models that either explain the development of racial/ethnic identity or present reference group typologies or patterns for multiracial people. Unfortunately, most models have been developed from small samples with particular blended combinations (e.g. Black/White, Japanese/White) and have not been tested on larger, more diverse samples. In other words, the efforts to develop mixed race identity models have not been matched with subsequent efforts to develop racial/ethnic identity scales. The creation and validation of a multiracial identity scale is an important contribution to critical mixed race studies to facilitate systematic findings on identity for multiracial individuals of various combinations. This dissertation will focus on the initial development of the Multiracial Reference Group Orientation Scale (MRGOS). The MRGOS was originally designed to measure four reference group orientations found in empirical research among multiracial populations: single RGO (orientation toward one parent ethnic group), multigroup RGO (orientation toward multiple parent ethnic groups), mixed race RGO (orientation toward other mixed race people as a group), and postracial RGO (nonidentification with parent ethnic groups and rejection of racial categorization). The MRGOS has been developed using an online survey targeting mixed race undergraduates at several four-year colleges and universities in California. Exploratory factor analysis and reliability analysis yielded a six-factor scale. Five of the factors conformed to the RGOs proposed in the model, including two postracial factors, though one non-RGO factor (Exploration) was also extracted from the original list of items. Adequate internal consistency was found for all of the RGO subscales except for the second postracial subscale. Partial support was found for the known groups validity of the mixed race, single, and one of the postracial subscales.

Sociology",Sociology,Maria Charles,"With regards to the work itself, private and personal cheffing seem to open doors for some individuals (i.e. women, parents, older adults) who might not otherwise enter or stay in the culinary profession. However, chefs may face discriminatory hiring practices in private employment, and ultimately, these fields may actually contribute to the (re)production of gender segregation within the culinary profession. Women outnumber men as personal chefs, a field with relatively low status and earnings (though this varies), while many of the men in my study seemed to treat private/personal cheffing as a springboard towards work with higher pay, status, and visibility. Tensions between selves, or between the material and ""moral"" spheres of life, contributed to many participants' decisions to pursue private/personal cheffing. Engaging in what I call ""self-directed boundary work"", they recognized a discrepancy between who they were prior to the career move and their ""true"" or hoped-for self. Most of my participants are satisfied with the change; they have taken a stand against overly demanding, inflexible, and/or personally meaningless work. However, not everyone has the opportunity or resources to engage in this kind of self-change. Furthermore, because social forces shape (and limit) our ideas about who we are, making decisions based on these self-conceptions has the potential to reproduce social inequalities. This dissertation examines how private and personal chefs manage tensions about their identity and status. It draws primarily on interviews with private and personal chefs in California, along with a nationwide survey of personal chefs. Both types of chefs work in and for private households, though typically private chefs are employed by one household while personal chefs are self-employed and offer a range of services (e.g. prepared meals, dinner parties, cooking classes). These chefs are emblematic of several recent changes in American work and culture, and they are also very ambiguously positioned with regards to both their societal and intraprofessional status. Located somewhere between chefs (looked highly upon today) and domestic workers, private/personal chefs could be seen as artists or as menial and subordinate laborers. Moreover, most of these chefs are white and/or native born, middle-class, and highly educated, while domestic workers are usually foreign-born women of color. In order to respond to these tensions, the chefs draw symbolic boundaries (i.e. engage in ""boundary work""), asserting their worth and declaring who they are and are not. Some of the chefs' boundary work challenges existing hierarchies and inequalities. They distinguish themselves from restaurant chefs, for instance, and contest the culinary profession's typical status hierarchy. They also criticize clients who act as if they are entitled to the chefs' services. More commonly, their boundary work reinforces societal and occupational hierarchies. Beliefs about the worth of individuals based on their gender, race, or class often underlie their distinctions. By distancing themselves from home cooks and domestic servants, for example, they reinforce the devaluation of household reproductive labor and those who typically perform it. Some chefs also express a preference for clients with ""good"" taste, legitimating class-based cultural distinctions. This dissertation clearly illustrates our ambivalence towards care(work). Household reproductive labor continues to be devalued. Yet, a need to care for oneself and others motivated changes in career paths, and caring for others was a widely shared source of satisfaction with the work. This study points to the need to start treating care as a social responsibility -- the need to start tearing down boundaries rather than drawing them.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

The BSW phenomena is conceived of as an alternative budgetary process that grants non-traditional stakeholders such as service recipients a seat at the table of California's budgetary decision-making process. The inclusion of non-traditional stakeholders is occurring at the same time that BSWs have become the venue to develop and implement large department reductions, specifically in the Health and Human Services arena. This study considers the historical evolution of California's BSWs through the Health and Human Services budgetary process and their impact on the institution. Expanding the field of institutional change, through interviews with administrators, legislative staff and members, lobbyist and advocates, this study addresses the issue of institutional change within a public bureaucratic institution.

In particular, few scholars have explored the collective experiences of young women living in the inner city and the innovative strategies they develop to navigate daily life in this setting. My analysis uncovers forms of gender-specific violence, particular kinds of troubled public encounters, as well as the different types of physical and emotional work young women do to negotiate the demands of living in underserved communities regularly exposed to violence.

Sociology",Sociology,Fernando Lopez-Alves,"The local food movement offers the simple premise that changing the way we eat can change the world. As the global adoption of neoliberal practices has encouraged the ""privatization of survival,"" where states deregulate, sell, and commodify social services once provided for free or at low cost, people without monetary means to access them have gone into debt or gone without. This reduction in public services, rising unemployment rates, soaring fuel and food costs, and a ""race to the bottom in food"" production that makes food less nutritious and less safe, have made more people unable to provide for basic needs and consume healthy food. Additionally, as neoliberal policies have triggered extreme economic inequality, acute difficulties meeting basic needs, and the erosion of political representation, people have responded by rejecting globalization outright or attempting to guide it down a more sustainable path. To better understand the nature of such responses to globalization, where the local food movement fits in, and how urban agriculture efforts in Detroit, Flint, and Ypsilanti are unique, this project documents how the local food movement seeks to relocalize the economy and adopt more sustainable consumption practices to counter the economic inequality, resource scarcity, and social fragmentation exacerbated by neoliberal policies and practices. This project is an ethnographic study of the local food movement in southeastern Michigan and California conducted through urban agriculture experiments and participant observation of farmers markets, urban farms, farmers' cooperatives, community and school gardens, restaurants, non-profits, and local food distribution networks. It also included an online survey investigating motives to support and participate in the local food movement, a comparison between the physical environment, food system, and social environment in Michigan and California, and informal interviews with growers, producers, eaters, chefs, and business owners. It found that although California agriculture is dominant in crop diversity, growing season, and production volume, Michigan has advantages in water and land access, food safety legislation, and zoning ordinances that enable urban agriculture initiatives to be more successful.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Sociology",Sociology,Howard Winant,"This dissertation, entitled ""Agency and Action: Immigrant Lives and Immigrant Politics in the Deportation Nation,"" examines the ways in which undocumented Mexican immigrants manage and contest the threat of apprehension and deportation in two communities in California. This project employs a comparative ethnographic approach, including in depth interviews with 61 immigrant respondents in two cities in one county and participant observation in both places over the course of three years. In this study, I make three interrelated arguments: First, the ""post-border"" turn in immigration enforcement demonstrates that the state has geographically displaced but not resolved a growing contradiction between neoliberal economic demands for the free movement of capital and competing national security demands for control over the movement of people. Second, I argue that the increasingly local character of immigration enforcement renders it susceptible to local political climates; this both opens up and closes down avenues to greater inclusion for immigrant communities. Various structural conditions and biographical idiosyncrasies increase or decrease the likelihood of four types of immigrant resistance: avoidance/insulation, ""everyday"" resistance, advocacy, and collective mobilization. Third, at the level of subjectivity, I characterize immigrants who engage in political activism as ""instrumental activists"": willing to participate in social movement organizing, not out of a generalized commitment to social justice, but motivated by material and mundane desires for the betterment of self and family that largely align with largely normative visions of work and family life. Earlier studies of immigration have focused on the mechanisms of social control that circumscribe the life chances of immigrants. In this dissertation, I take a different tack and examine the forms of agency within immigrant communities as people manage intensified risks in their daily lives. While there is a growing literature examining various forms of immigrant agency, these studies tend to focus on only one type of immigrant agency, producing varied empirical portraits of the efficacy and impact of immigrant agency and political activity. I explicitly examine the relationships among four different types of immigrant agency in order to examine the biographical idiosyncrasies and structural conditions that influence the form that immigrant agency will take. These developments raise important questions about shifting forms of state power, the status of race relations in the U.S., and the place of immigrants in liberal democratic and capitalist societies.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Ten smart growth projects (SGPs) in four cities within California and Oregon were identified and semi-structured interviews were held with the respective developers, architects and civic officials, who were involved in the implementation process. Comparative, descriptive and grounded approaches were used to generate themes from interviews and other data sources. The dissertation culminates with a concluding chapter that briefly assesses the findings and their implications for social science, economic practice, and public policy. American urban development is characterized by urban sprawl: the low-density, single-family housing and separated land uses that are dependent on automobile transportation. Sprawl has negative affects for the environment and for social health. In the last twenty years, planners and developers have adopted smart growth principles. Smart growth is a land-use philosophy and practice that promotes higher density housing, mixed-use neighborhoods, more open spaces, transit alternatives to the automobile, and social equity through mixed-income neighborhoods. It is viewed as an alternative to sprawl. The research project first examines the structural and cultural features of communities that both support and oppose smart growth development. This dissertation then examines whether or not smart growth represents a break from the practices of conventional urban development, long theorized as a growth machine. The growth machine describes the collusion of land-use interests with local government to direct economic growth. The purpose of this inquiry is to determine if there is an empirically distinct smart growth machine.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Sociology",Sociology,Verta Taylor,"Social movement abeyance theorizes the persistence of social movements during times that are antagonistic to mobilization. In this dissertation, I argue that U.S. feminism is currently in abeyance and that educational institutions are generative environments for abeyance structures. Drawing on theories of women's movements, student movements, and movements inside institutions, I provide a systematic updating of abeyance theory. The study's design is comparative: the three field sites are Smith College, the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities and the University of California-Santa Barbara, which are not only in three different regions of the U.S. but also have diverse student demographics and activist cultures. I employ both qualitative and quantitative methods and include semi-structured interviews (n=75), participant observation, and a survey of college students on each campus (n=1,400). I highlight three variable dimensions that help us understand the unique nature of social movements in abeyance: fields of contention, collective identity, and tactical repertoires. I argue that during periods in which mobilized participants have little support: a) institutions of higher education provide welcome environments for feminist mobilization, often in unexpected locations such as multi-cultural sororities and student government; b) feminist collective identities nest or ""spill over"" to influence other social movements including queer, anti-racist, and anti-fee hike organizations; and c) tactics move on-line, especially to social networking sites. The dissertation also attends to larger theoretical questions pertaining to emerging forms of political contestation and the persistence of social movements based on fundamental cleavages of gender, race/ethnicity, class, and sexuality.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Sociology",Sociology,Beth Schneider,"In the worst recession since the great depression, California's historic leadership of innovation and investment was replaced with budget reductions and the elimination of services and programs. What emerged in 2008 was the implementation of Budget Stakeholder Workgroups (BSWs) by the California Legislature, a process that is still used today. The BSW phenomena is conceived of as an alternative budgetary process that grants non-traditional stakeholders such as service recipients a seat at the table of California's budgetary decision-making process. The inclusion of non-traditional stakeholders is occurring at the same time that BSWs have become the venue to develop and implement large department reductions, specifically in the Health and Human Services arena. This study considers the historical evolution of California's BSWs through the Health and Human Services budgetary process and their impact on the institution. Expanding the field of institutional change, through interviews with administrators, legislative staff and members, lobbyist and advocates, this study addresses the issue of institutional change within a public bureaucratic institution. Unlike new institutionalism, this study demonstrates that institutional change is a process beyond conformity and acknowledges the agency of individuals. This study also documents gradual institutional change and extends sociological understandings of bureaucratic institutions as a positive process.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Sociology",Sociology,"Nikki Jones, Sarah Fenstermaker","This dissertation examines how Black women and girls navigate distressed urban neighborhoods. Nearly two years of field research among adolescents and adults in the Central East neighborhood of Oakland, California provides an ethnographic account of how young Black women accomplish the routine tasks necessary for basic survival in poor inner city neighborhoods and how the intersections of race, gender, and class shape how Black women and girls interact with others in public. Previous research has examined the experiences of African American men and boys living in disadvantaged communities, whereas my research pays special attention to the experiences of African American women and girls. In particular, few scholars have explored the collective experiences of young women living in the inner city and the innovative strategies they develop to navigate daily life in this setting. My analysis uncovers forms of gender-specific violence, particular kinds of troubled public encounters, as well as the different types of physical and emotional work young women do to negotiate the demands of living in underserved communities regularly exposed to violence. My original analysis of routine public interactions illustrates the lived experiences of poor African American women and girls and the creative strategies they develop to manage these troubling, everyday experiences and survive in this space each day.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Sociology",Sociology,Geoffrey Raymond,"As conversation analysts have shown, participants can achieve a variety of social actions via talk alone (as with telephone conversations), or alternately via embodied behavior in the absence of talk. In some instances, however, people use talk in conjunction with embodied behavior, articulating precisely what it is they are doing (or alternately, what they would like recipients to believe they are doing). Drawing upon digital videos from the University of California, Santa Barbara's vast collection of naturally occurring interactions, cases in which the aforementioned practice occurs were identified, collected, and analyzed using the established methods of conversation analysis. Self-formulations of embodied actions were found in one of three sequential positions relative to the actions they explicate: before the commission of an action, after its completion or abandonment, or while an action was still underway. Generally, self-formulations either serve as a prophylactic against potential trouble or in response to trouble that has actually transpired. Self-formulations provide recipients with an ""official account"" of what a person is about to do, has done (or tried to do), or is involved with doing. In formulating their actions, participants show themselves to be oriented not only to possible interactional troubles, but also to the fact that recipients routinely monitor others' in-progress actions, drawing inferences about their import.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Sociology",Sociology,Fernando Lopez-Alves,"The local food movement offers the simple premise that changing the way we eat can change the world. As the global adoption of neoliberal practices has encouraged the ""privatization of survival,"" where states deregulate, sell, and commodify social services once provided for free or at low cost, people without monetary means to access them have gone into debt or gone without. This reduction in public services, rising unemployment rates, soaring fuel and food costs, and a ""race to the bottom in food"" production that makes food less nutritious and less safe, have made more people unable to provide for basic needs and consume healthy food. Additionally, as neoliberal policies have triggered extreme economic inequality, acute difficulties meeting basic needs, and the erosion of political representation, people have responded by rejecting globalization outright or attempting to guide it down a more sustainable path. To better understand the nature of such responses to globalization, where the local food movement fits in, and how urban agriculture efforts in Detroit, Flint, and Ypsilanti are unique, this project documents how the local food movement seeks to relocalize the economy and adopt more sustainable consumption practices to counter the economic inequality, resource scarcity, and social fragmentation exacerbated by neoliberal policies and practices. This project is an ethnographic study of the local food movement in southeastern Michigan and California conducted through urban agriculture experiments and participant observation of farmers markets, urban farms, farmers' cooperatives, community and school gardens, restaurants, non-profits, and local food distribution networks. It also included an online survey investigating motives to support and participate in the local food movement, a comparison between the physical environment, food system, and social environment in Michigan and California, and informal interviews with growers, producers, eaters, chefs, and business owners. It found that although California agriculture is dominant in crop diversity, growing season, and production volume, Michigan has advantages in water and land access, food safety legislation, and zoning ordinances that enable urban agriculture initiatives to be more successful.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Sociology",Sociology,Howard Winant,"This dissertation, entitled ""Agency and Action: Immigrant Lives and Immigrant Politics in the Deportation Nation,"" examines the ways in which undocumented Mexican immigrants manage and contest the threat of apprehension and deportation in two communities in California. This project employs a comparative ethnographic approach, including in depth interviews with 61 immigrant respondents in two cities in one county and participant observation in both places over the course of three years. In this study, I make three interrelated arguments: First, the ""post-border"" turn in immigration enforcement demonstrates that the state has geographically displaced but not resolved a growing contradiction between neoliberal economic demands for the free movement of capital and competing national security demands for control over the movement of people. Second, I argue that the increasingly local character of immigration enforcement renders it susceptible to local political climates; this both opens up and closes down avenues to greater inclusion for immigrant communities. Various structural conditions and biographical idiosyncrasies increase or decrease the likelihood of four types of immigrant resistance: avoidance/insulation, ""everyday"" resistance, advocacy, and collective mobilization. Third, at the level of subjectivity, I characterize immigrants who engage in political activism as ""instrumental activists"": willing to participate in social movement organizing, not out of a generalized commitment to social justice, but motivated by material and mundane desires for the betterment of self and family that largely align with largely normative visions of work and family life. Earlier studies of immigration have focused on the mechanisms of social control that circumscribe the life chances of immigrants. In this dissertation, I take a different tack and examine the forms of agency within immigrant communities as people manage intensified risks in their daily lives. While there is a growing literature examining various forms of immigrant agency, these studies tend to focus on only one type of immigrant agency, producing varied empirical portraits of the efficacy and impact of immigrant agency and political activity. I explicitly examine the relationships among four different types of immigrant agency in order to examine the biographical idiosyncrasies and structural conditions that influence the form that immigrant agency will take. These developments raise important questions about shifting forms of state power, the status of race relations in the U.S., and the place of immigrants in liberal democratic and capitalist societies.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Sociology",Sociology,Simonetta Falasca-Zamponi,"This dissertation analyzes the cultural meaning of the tree and the ways in which trees reflect and contribute to important discourses about nature and our relationship with the natural world. Although these discourses are often collectively identified as environmentalism, this all-encompassing term contains subtle but important differences that are occluded by the very language of environmentalism. The most important cultural ""location"" for this phenomenon is the tree, which is a metonym for nature. The tree, as representation, as idea, and as a physical organism, is deployed and understood in very different ways and for very different purposes. These differences are rendered invisible to many research methods because contemporary American culture treats trees with automatic hagiographic respect. Direct questioning, through survey research or traditional interviewing, will reveal only the superficial respect given to trees. More creative interview methods, along with a close reading of the way trees are treated in popular culture, reveal the divergent sensibilities that use arboreal language as a way to understand and give meaning to the relationship between humans and the physical world. Interviews were conducted in public urban and forested areas in California, Kansas, and New York and complemented by hermeneutic analysis of tree imagery in Christmas decorations, advertising, and landscape. Each interview revolved around the infamous 'If you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be?' question made popular by Barbara Walters. The methods, interviews and analysis employed reveal just how many faux-environmentalist sensibilities rely on the idea, image, and planting of trees. When the tree is worshiped, uncritically, as a balm for all the ills of the modern world, it denies ecological thinking. The romanticization of the tree is dangerous because it usurps trees from the plant kingdom and uses them to redecorate and remodel urban environments. Trees are a counter-narrative to modernity, but a failed counter-narrative, an evil detournement. Within these discourses, however, is another sensibility, suggesting ways that even a tree-based rhetoric can shift into a more holistic ecological approach that can eliminate the delineation of nature, as non-man, into a vision of an ecology that permeates the urban and rural Earth.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Sociology",Sociology,"G. Reginald Daniel, Denise A. Segura","Extensive theoretical and empirical research on the subject of racial/ethnic identity among multiracial (i.e. ""mixed race"") populations has yielded several models that either explain the development of racial/ethnic identity or present reference group typologies or patterns for multiracial people. Unfortunately, most models have been developed from small samples with particular blended combinations (e.g. Black/White, Japanese/White) and have not been tested on larger, more diverse samples. In other words, the efforts to develop mixed race identity models have not been matched with subsequent efforts to develop racial/ethnic identity scales. The creation and validation of a multiracial identity scale is an important contribution to critical mixed race studies to facilitate systematic findings on identity for multiracial individuals of various combinations. This dissertation will focus on the initial development of the Multiracial Reference Group Orientation Scale (MRGOS). The MRGOS was originally designed to measure four reference group orientations found in empirical research among multiracial populations: single RGO (orientation toward one parent ethnic group), multigroup RGO (orientation toward multiple parent ethnic groups), mixed race RGO (orientation toward other mixed race people as a group), and postracial RGO (nonidentification with parent ethnic groups and rejection of racial categorization). The MRGOS has been developed using an online survey targeting mixed race undergraduates at several four-year colleges and universities in California. Exploratory factor analysis and reliability analysis yielded a six-factor scale. Five of the factors conformed to the RGOs proposed in the model, including two postracial factors, though one non-RGO factor (Exploration) was also extracted from the original list of items. Adequate internal consistency was found for all of the RGO subscales except for the second postracial subscale. Partial support was found for the known groups validity of the mixed race, single, and one of the postracial subscales. Steps for the further development of the scale and the broader implications of the scale for research on race and ethnicity are discussed.",California,-119.4179324,36.778261,330

Education",Education,Hsiu-Zu Ho,"Results of the study showed that Southeast Asian Americans who were committed to their ethnic identities prior to college continued to explore their ethnic identities in college. Ethnic exploration occurred predominantly within social spaces, such as within ethnic student organizations. Parents' prior ethnic socialization continued to influence whether students were committed to their ethnic identities. Although participation in ethnic practices and traditions had generally declined in college, students maintained cultural beliefs and values that were conducive towards academic success and college persistence. With respect to college integration, students were generally socially integrated only within ethnic- and racial-related spaces. Contrary to what was expected, female students remained committed to their ethnic group even if they were in disagreement with their parents' and ethnic community's traditional gender expectations. Lastly, the findings suggested that choices in ethnic and racial identity labels varied across contexts and that ethnic identity was relevant to student development and possibly college success. The Southeast Asian American students' cultural identities contributed to their social integration, and that social integration supported the students' overall persistence in college. This study included individual interviews with a sample of 27 Southeast Asian American students that were all attending the same four-year university in California. Participants were recruited from campus spaces that were predicted to have a large Southeast Asian American presence. The interview guide addressed students' prior ethnic socialization experiences before entering college and also students' ethnic- and non-ethnic-based experiences since arriving to college. Participants were asked specific questions pertaining to ethnic identity exploration and commitment. Line-by-line coding was conducted on the interview transcripts and themes were organized across the interviews to address the four major research questions of the study. The perception of the high-achieving Asian American student can make invisible the challenges these students face as ethnic minorities on their college campuses. In particular, Southeast Asian American students, such as those of Cambodian, Laotian, and Vietnamese descent, encounter additional barriers because of the circumstances of their parents' migration experiences and the ethnic socialization that occurs within their families and communities. Most current research that has been conducted on Asian Americans in higher education has not focused specifically on Southeast Asian American students. As argued by Teranishi, Behringer, Grey, and Parker (2009), college student development models may not be inclusive of the experiences of Southeast Asian American students, especially since those models may not account for how academic development can intersect with students' ethnic identity development. Primarily based on Tinto's (1975) college retention model, this present study examined the college integration and ethnic identity development of a sample of Southeast Asian American undergraduate students.",Cambodia,104.990963,12.565679,1

Lim,"Unsettling Solidarities examines Asian North American and Indigenous solidarities, alliances, and interactions imagined in the contemporary literatures of these two communities, tracing how these moments of literary contact reveal the vexed dynamics of race and resistance after the mid-twentieth century. Emerging out of anti-colonial and anti-racist movements of the 1950-70s, narratives by Maxine Hong Kingston, Joy Kogawa, Karen Tei Yamashita, and Leslie Marmon Silko grapple with the limits of identity-based cultural politics, articulating in its their place different collectivities and ethical relations that can account for the increasing stratifications of power within and across racial identities. The dissertation tracks the aesthetically diverse ways these writers imagine their own and each other's communities within their revised cultural politics, and argues that the ambivalent depictions register these communities' differential yet mutually constitutive histories and critical visions for social justice. Recent scholarship in Critical Race and Ethnic Studies has posited a comparative framework---within and between communities of difference---for apprehending the shifting localities, agents, and processes of settler colonial distributions of life and (vulnerabilities to) death. Such analytics have become urgent within the context of (neo)liberal multiculturalism and its selective recognition of cultural difference as the condition of possibility for new global economic restructuring for inequities. Asian/Indigenous convergences, in particular, bring to the fore how civil rights frameworks can elide Indigenous experiences, perpetuating discursive erasures of settler colonial conditions. The dissertation's project foregrounds these tensions, attending to their biopolitical and affective dimensions, as they are revealed, negotiated, and metonymically reproduced within the narratives. By investigating the intersecting affective economies of Asian/Indigenous interaction, imagined at various geopolitical sites (such as Hawai`i, the U.S./Mexico Border, Canada, and Brazil), this study connects intimate and localized specificities of racial formations to broader networks of settler national configurations.",Canada,-106.346771,56.130366,7

Vegetation represents a major reservoir for terrestrial carbon stocks, and improving our ability to inventory vegetation will enhance our understanding of the impacts of land cover and climate change on carbon stocks and fluxes. These relationships may be an indication of a series of troubling biosphere-atmospheric feedback mechanisms that need to be better understood and modeled. Valuable land cover information can be provided to the global climate change modeling community using advanced remote sensing capabilities such as Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and Airborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (AIRSAR). Individually and synergistically, data were successfully used to characterize the complex nature of the Canadian boreal forest land cover types. The multiple endmember spectral mixture analysis process was applied against seasonal AVIRIS data to produce species-level vegetated land cover maps of two study sites in the Canadian boreal forest: Old Black Spruce (OBS) and Old Jack Pine (OJP). The highest overall accuracy was assessed to be at least 66% accurate to the available reference map, providing evidence that high-quality, species-level land cover mapping of the Canadian boreal forest is achievable at accuracy levels greater than other previous research efforts in the region. Backscatter information from multichannel, polarimetric SAR utilizing a binary decision tree-based classification technique methodology was moderately successfully applied to AIRSAR to produce maps of the boreal land cover types at both sites, with overall accuracies at least 59%. A process, centered around noise whitening and principal component analysis features of the minimum noise fraction transform, was implemented to leverage synergies contained within spatially coregistered multitemporal and multisensor AVIRIS and AIRSAR data sets to successfully produce high-accuracy boreal forest land cover maps. Overall land cover map accuracies of 78% and 72% were assessed for OJP and OBS sites, respectively, for either seasonal or multitemporal data sets. High individual land cover accuracies appeared to be independent of site, season, or multisensor combination in the minimum-noise fraction-based approach.",Canada,-106.346771,56.130366,7

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Stanley Awramik,"The chert members of the Paleoproterozoic Gunflint Formation, Ontario, Canada, are commonly regarded as examples of primary silica chemical sediments. This interpretation is founded upon the high fidelity of preservation of microfossils in the chert, the ubiquitous nature of silica, and a lack of observed primary carbonate. Previous arguments for silica replacement of limestone (carbonate) are based on indirect evidence and are largely dismissed. Gunflint microfossils are thus regarded as having lived in a silica-rich environment, which makes them unusual compared to most other pre-Phanerozoic microfossils that are known from silicified carbonates. Direct evidence that carbonate was a primary mineral species of the Lower Algal Chert Member (where most of the microbiota are found) has been discovered at Whitefish Falls, Nolalu, Ontario. Iron-stained, low-Mg calcite ooids containing (1) well-preserved growth laminae, (2) textures indicating a disrupted tangential fabric of growth laminae, and (3) quartz cross-cutting the growth laminae indicate the initial mineral of the ooids was a carbonate, probably aragonite. Stromatolite columns contain large areas of low-Mg calcite, with specular hematite crystals that display cross-cutting relationships with calcite and quartz that demonstrate calcite was primary, hematite secondary, and quartz tertiary. The cross-cutting relations also show that silicification took place in at least two stages. One of the silicification events took place very early in diagenesis. Thus the Gunflint microbiota may not have existed in a radically different environment (silica precipitating) than those of most other known Proterozoic microbiotas. High fidelity of preservation of microfossils does not always indicate that the mineral entombing them was the primary mineral precipitated from aqueous solution.",Canada,-106.346771,56.130366,7

Materials",Materials,Edward J. Kramer,"Considerable academic and industrial efforts have been dedicated to resolving scientific and technological issues associated with the fabrication of efficient plastic solar cells via solution deposition techniques. The most successful strategy used to generate solution processable devices implements a two component donor-acceptor type system composed of a (p-type) narrow bandgap conjugated polymer donor blended with a (n-type) fullerene acceptor. Due to the limited exciton diffusion lengths (~10 nm) inherent to these materials, efficient photoinduced charge generation requires heterojunction formation (i.e. donor/acceptor interfaces) in close proximity to the region of exciton generation. Maximal charge extraction therefore requires that donor and acceptor components form nanoscale phase separated percolating pathways to their respective electrodes. Devices exhibiting these structural characteristics are termed bulk heterojunction devices (BHJ). Although the BHJ architecture highlights the basic characteristics of functional donor-acceptor type organic solar cells, device optimization requires internal order within each phase and proper organization relative to the substrate in order to maximize charge transport efficiencies and minimize charge carrier recombination losses. The economic viability of BHJ solar cells hinges upon the minimization of processing costs; thus, commercially relevant processing techniques should generate optimal structural characteristics during film formation, eliminating the need for additional post deposition processing steps. Empirical optimization has shown that solution deposition using high boiling point additives (e.g. octanedithiol (ODT)) provides a simple and widely used fabrication method for maximizing the power conversion efficiencies of BHJ solar cells. This work will show using x-ray scattering that a small percentage of ODT (~2%) in chlorobenzene induces the nucleation of polymeric crystallites within 2 min of deposition, increases the orientational order of specific polymorphs, and promotes further crystallite nucleation over a period longer than 40 min after casting. In addition, three dimensional chemical maps derived from energy filtered transmission electron microtomography (EF-TEMT) are used to demonstrate that subtle changes in the chemistry of the polymer backbone, as well as the use of solvent additives, have dramatic effects on the types of phase separated structures that develop in two different high efficiency solar cell blends. Solvent additives are demonstrated to have the ability both to refine coarser than optimal microstructures and to coarsen finer than optimal microstructures.",Canada,-106.346771,56.130366,7

Even in 2014, as it celebrates 20 years of democracy, South Africa garners the attention of scholars, NGO activists, and political refugees---all of whom are captivated by the expanse of minority and human rights enshrined in its constitution. With such attention, Cape Town earns the proud moniker "" The Gay Capital of Africa""---whose vibrant nightlife makes it an (inter, trans)national epitome of ""LGBT"" equality. Such impulses are implicated in struggles over race and space that reveal persistent class divisions among black and coloured-identified gay men. I, therefore, commit my research to participants' significant and agentic strategies to achieve visibility and participate in ""The Gay Capital of Africa""---through which they upset the terms of effort and construct more capacious ways of being a gay man. Drawing from Michel Foucault, Jasbir Puar, Jose Munoz, and Roland Barthes' notion of ""Vestimentary Systems,"" I conclude that clothing is a performance of post-apartheid modernity and strategy for surviving persistent structural constraints in Cape Town. I ask: what are the terms of such equality? How do gay men seek, acquire, and maintain visibility in Capetonian nightlife? What does such visibility mean, and what does the South African state gain from its documentation in LGBT tourism media? Through participant observation and interviews, I explore what admission standards at nightlife venues in De Waterkant---Cape Town's ""Gay Village---say about being a (post-apartheid) gay man. Juxtaposing gay nightlife with a post-apartheid democracy, I show how nightclubs are regulatory institutions that produce subjects whose clothed bodies signify gay and racial equality.

Blacks are still largely excluded from white spaces and denied the resources and opportunities historically hoarded by whites. Despite their socially marginalized positions, Black South African women in the peri-urban townships have successfully established home-based bed and breakfasts for tourists in the post-apartheid era. In entering the global tourism market, some of these entrepreneurial Black women have developed social and economic relationships with white South African and European women. This thesis examines these transracial and transnational partnerships in the South African township bed and breakfast market. Drawing from field research and interviews conducted in Khayelitsha, a township outside of Cape Town, I demonstrate how these connections facilitate Black women's small business establishment and growth.

Analyzing both ALBA (Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas) and opposition discourses, I consider the importance of consolidating a counter-hegemonic media presence as well as state media policies and the transnational and global political infrastructure of the Caracas-based, multi-state satellite TeleSUR (Television of the South) television network. I also textually analyze the practices of some of TeleSUR's programs to demonstrate the way in which the network contributes to the hyperbolic and ubiquitous presence of Chavez in the media and its use of cultural programming to define the focus of a Global South cultural agenda. I suggest that TeleSUR is part of an emergent model of national media systems, which in the context of neoliberal globalization, resists the global media hegemony of the West in new transnational maneuvers through new alliances with regional and global actors across Internet, cable and satellite platforms and its promotion of ALBA. One of the geopolitical goals of the TeleSUR initiative is to build an enduring regional and global infrastructure through these media platforms to challenge the Global Northern media monopoly on many fronts, resulting in what I argue is an incipient Global South ""nation-building"" project, imbricated in regional, national, transnational and local identities. But to build this infrastructure, the Bolivarian state is using an antiquated, bureaucratic anti-imperialist rhetoric at a time when the world is made up of a heterodox assemblage of political actors and declining U.S. hegemony.

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Alexander Simms,"Establishing sea-cliff erosion rates is a vital component of coastal zone management. Laser scanning technology can provide a fast, reliable, and accurate means to survey sea-cliffs covering large areas of the coastline and to establish local erosion rates. The technology allows for the rapid laterally continuous survey of sea-cliffs with Dynamic Laser Scanning (DLS) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) surveys. Data collected from DLS and LiDAR surveys for southern Santa Barbara County were compared in a Geographic Information System (GIS). This study establishes regional erosion rates using NOAA LiDAR data along southern Santa Barbara County coastal bluffs from Point Conception to Rincon Point (Carpinteria, California). Regional retreat rates for southern Santa Barbara County calculated in GIS from 1998 and 2010 NOAA LiDAR data range from 4 to 73 cm yr-1. Local erosion rates were also established along Lagoon Road on the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) campus and at Point Conception. The average retreat rate at UCSB calculated from 1997 LiDAR and 2012 DLS data was 24 cm yr-1. Areas along Lagoon Road protected by rip rap have lower average retreat rates of 15 cm yr-1. The Lagoon Road retreat rates are similar to manually surveyed rates along these same cliffs. Erosion rates along the Lagoon Road sea-cliff with active drain pipes, seepage, and tree falls were expected to experience higher cliff erosion rates than sections of the sea-cliff without these influences, but the results of this study did not confirm my hypothesis. Retreat rates at Lagoon Road were higher than retreat rates at Point Conception. The higher rates are attributed to the presence of excessive surface runoff and the orientation of the dip of the beds. Comparison of 100 m of overlapping DLS data along Lagoon Road from November 2011 and January 2012 suggests that the top of the cliff is retreating at a higher rate than the base, which is a consequence of excess surface runoff. The aspect of the sea-cliff was also found to have an influence on erosion rates, with higher retreat rates correlating to south facing sea-cliffs. Unless measures are taken to impede the current rate of erosion along Lagoon Road, the road will be undercut in 60 years.",Carpinteria,-119.5184564,34.3988838,1

Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology","Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology","Steven D. Gaines, Robert R. Warner","Body size has long been recognized as a key driver of species interactions and of an individual's role in the ecosystem. Body size determines the amount, species, and sizes of prey resources an individual can consume, as well as its own susceptibility to predators. Human harvest of predators can result in severe truncations in predator body size that can have cascading consequences on food webs. Where small and large individuals of the same species differ greatly in their diets, as is common in aquatic systems, the absence of large predators may functionally eliminate a key predator-prey linkage. Recently management agencies have begun to include size-based metrics as targets. As various harvest strategies differentially affect predator size and biomass, the research presented in this dissertation aims to understand the conditions under which truncations in predator size structure will result in additional loss of predator function than would be predicted from predator biomass alone, and where it will therefore be important to maintain predator size distributions. I specifically examine how the type of ontogenetic shift in diet (e.g. prey species or size class), and the shape of the diet switching function (e.g. gradual or abrupt) will affect the consequences of the loss of the largest predators, and the relative utility of various management strategies in maintaining predator function. In Chapter 1, I examined the tradeoffs between fishery yield and predator function in the ecosystem when preferentially fishing the largest predators. I found that fisheries that delay harvest until large predator sizes maximize fishery yield but that this virtually eliminates predation on focal prey eaten late in life history when diet shifts are abrupt and occur at or after the size at maturity. In this case, there is a clear tradeoff between fisheries and ecosystem objectives. Instead, where shifts in diet toward late prey are more gradual, targeting the largest predators can achieve a win-win by maximizing yield and achieving predation rates similar to that with other strategies that harvest predators earlier. As such, the optimal fishing strategy to achieve both single-species and ecosystem benefits depends strongly on the interaction between the fishery selectivity pattern and the changes in predator diet with size. In Chapter 2, I quantified the size-dependence of the predator-prey interaction between herbivorous sea urchins and one of their important predators in southern California kelp forests, California Sheephead. I further examined the consequences of changes in sheephead size and abundance in marine reserves at Catalina Island on size-specific urchin mortality in field predation trials. In my observations of predation of sheephead on urchins, sheephead smaller than 20cm TL do not eat urchins of any size. Thereafter, small sheephead only consumed small urchins, with larger sheephead sizes needed to successfully consume larger urchins, and the largest sheephead preferentially targeted the largest urchins. Inside marine reserves at Catalina, the greater abundance of large sheephead in combination with the observed size-specific capacities for urchin predation led to higher urchin mortality with marine reserve protection, particularly for the largest urchins. Ultimately, by restoring predator size structure, reserves may serve to enhance the resilience of southern California kelp forests. In Chapter 3, I examined how variation in predator body size distributions and biomass affects the likelihood of size escapes in situations where predators begin eating prey at some threshold size and thereafter consume increasingly larger prey. We focus on California sheephead because of the size dependence of its interaction with herbivorous sea urchins (Chapter 2), and the natural variation in demography where sheephead achieve smaller maximum sizes but higher biomass in the south of its range. We evaluate the consequences of smaller predator body size on top-down control of urchin populations in two scenarios: 1) when overall predator abundance is the same as the population with larger body size, and 2) when predator biomass is the same. With the same numbers of predators, top-down control was significantly weakened by the lack of large sheephead. However, when sheephead biomass was maintained, the absence of large sheephead did not lead to greater urchin abundance, despite lower predation rates overall and much lower predation on large urchins. Higher predation rates on the smallest urchin size classes served as a bottleneck that kept total urchin population at similar levels and prevented a size escape for the largest urchins. This suggests that where predators switch prey size classes in the same species, the loss of the largest individuals does not inherently result in weaker top-down control, if biomass is maintained, but effective control is sensitive to prey growth rates. The results of this research suggest that the ignoring shifts in predator size structure can under-estimate the effects of fishing on predator function, especially when large predators eat different species than their smaller counterparts. High predator biomass can compensate when diet shifts are to different prey size classes of the same species. Concordance between diet shifts and fishery selectivity can help identify where it will be important to consider changes in predator size in addition to biomass.",Catalina Island,-118.4163,33.3879,1

In addition to a detailed longue duree qualitative exploration of the process by which Soviet policies fostered deeply ingrained national identities that became powerful organizing tools in the post-Soviet era, this work also pursues a quantitative examination of demographic data compiled by the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union and the post-Soviet states to show that ethno-national homogenization of territory in favor of the titular nationalities was a process that began long before the violence and acts of ethnic cleansing that occurred with the fall of the USSR and that these demographic changes correlate with the different periods of implementation of nationalities specific policies.",Caucasus,45,43.5851814,1

The remaining few of these parasites live in sub-Saharan and Sahelian Africa in the countries of Chad, Ethiopia, Mali, and South Sudan. By the end of 2010 there were fewer than 1,800 cases of Guinea worm reported worldwide, an astonishing decrease from the estimated 3.5 million reported cases in 1980 when the international eradication effort began. There is no vaccine or preventative medicine to inoculate against the parasite and the eradication effort has focused on an educational program, teaching those at risk how to prevent infection. Through education and community programs to improve access to clean and safe drinking water, it is hoped that the parasite will have been eliminated from the waters worldwide in the near future. The goal of this research is to understand how Guinea worm has reemerged in regions where it had once been eliminated. A current hurdle to the eradication effort is to supervise the regions where Guinea worm once existed to ensure there is no reemergence. There have been several incidents of reemergence in the past and the work for this dissertation examines historical data on Guinea worm reemergence to better understand the process and identify the most suitable methods for locating regions at risk for reemergence. Results of this analysis show that specific transportation networks and medical facilities may play a role in determining the spread of Guinea worm as it reestablishes itself in a region. This work reiterates that both disease transmission and species abundance are fundamentally spatial processes and that the incorporation of spatial approaches provides new insights into the nature of Guinea worm reemergence.

Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology","Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology",Gretchen E. Hofmann,"Anthropogenic carbon emissions are predicted to alter marine ecosystems. One such change is the decline in ocean pH, known as ocean acidification. Model predictions of ocean acidification have guided biological experiments for more than a decade. Many studies predict negative consequences of future ocean pH on marine species. To understand how species will respond to future conditions, however, knowledge of present-day pH exposures is necessary and often limited. In this dissertation, I described present-day pH variability in three coastal regions and used the data to design laboratory experiments assessing the physiological response of two organisms, sea urchins and mussels, to changing ocean conditions. As recorded by autonomous pH sensors, I found three unique patterns of coastal pH variability. Near-shore Antarctica was characterized by a steep seasonal increase in pH and pH variability during summer phytoplankton blooms. The northern Channel Islands, California, exhibited event-scale and diurnal pH variability due to primary production of phytoplankton and fixed vegetation. Only mild effects from upwelling were detected at the islands, suggesting that this region may become a spatial refuge from extreme low pH in the future. Finally, Oregon was characterized by event-scale decreases in pH due to periodic upwelling events. The results from this research show that many coastal species experience short-term changes in pH that are within the same magnitude of change predicted for ocean acidification by the end of the century. While such present-day exposures to pH variability may promote tolerance of future pH change, these near-shore regions are also characterized by unique patterns of thermal stress. I conducted two studies to investigate the interactive effects of pH and temperature on organismal physiology. First, Antarctic sea urchin, Sterechinus neumayeri, early developmental stages (EDSs) currently experience < 2 C seasonal warming and may only experience a few degrees of ocean warming over the next 100 years. Despite development under pH and temperatures outside of current exposures, S. neumayeri EDSs exhibited high tolerance of a one-hour heat stress test, suggesting this species may be more resilient to ocean change than previously thought. Second, unlike Antarctic species, intertidal species at mid-latitudes experience daily temperature fluctuations that can exceed four times end-century predictions of ocean warming, due to tidal cycles. In Oregon, upwelling events enhance this temperature range by periodically delivering cold, low pH water to the intertidal zone. Depending on sea water conditions simulating an upwelling event (cold, low pH) or wind relaxation (warm, high pH), the intertidal mussel Mytilus californianus generated different transcriptomic signatures of the cellular heat shock response, following exposure to aerial heat stress. This suggests that future changes in seawater conditions may alter the heat stress tolerance of M. californianus during low tides. The results from this dissertation highlight the importance of designing experiments that reflect species' present-day and future multi-stressor environment, in order to generate ecologically relevant conclusions. As anthropogenic stressors continue to take hold of coastal seas, understanding the biological consequences is critical for management and conservation efforts.","Channel Islands, California",-119.3791204,33.4467604,1

As the editor of a successful southern periodical and a national woman's almanac, as well as minister's wife, Gilman challenged the traditional gender roles of southern women. Gilman organized and supported benevolent associations with missions that differed from traditional modes of southern charity while expanding women's social networks and public presence. She also endeavored to change southern attitudes regarding female education, which typically provided little intellectual opportunity for women, especially in comparison with the North. Slavery permeated cultural values so intensely that widespread change or collective action was almost impossible, and the Gilmans limited any real challenges to the institution of slavery to private acts.

These sculptures were meant to be seen by large audiences in public spaces, and were primarily didactic objects intended to promote physical, racial, and sexual fitness.and contributed to statistical imaginary of the interwar years. I argue that such representations derived their authority from their scientific aura and were an effective way to construct an imagined community blissfully unchallenged by diversity and difference. These sculptures were based explicitly on data compiled by large-scale statistical or anthropological projects. They were all meant to be seen by large audiences in public spaces (world's fairs, natural history museums, health museums) and were primarily didactic objects intended to promote physical, racial, and sexual fitness. Such representations derived their authority from their scientific and their artistic aura and were used as tools to develop a specific kind of public, while simultaneously discouraging the formation of others. They were effective ways by which to formulate and fix an imagined community in which the challenges of diversity and difference could be tamed if not fantasized away entirely.",Chicago,-87.6297982,41.8781136,5

Computer Science - Engineering",Computer Science - Engineering,Kevin Almeroth,"These two characteristics determine the Internet's ability to deliver objects across communication paths. Improving these two characteristics (bandwidth and delay) increase the ability of the Internet to deliver objects and thus improve the Internet's capability to deliver life improving services. To accomplish this goal I present projects along three areas of effort. These three areas of effort are: (1) Increase the ability of applications operating in challenging conditions to achieve their fair share of bandwidth. (2) Synthesize knowledge required to address the effort to reduce delay. (3) Develop protocols that reduce delay encountered in the communications paths of the Internet. The overarching purpose of this dissertation is to improve the Internet's ability to deliver life improving services. I have further divided this purpose into two goals. To improve the ability of applications operating in challenging network conditions to gain their fair share of the bandwidth resources and to reduce the delay with which these services are delivered. Every service delivered by the Internet consists of Internet objects that are delivered through communication paths across the Internet. The delivery of these objects is defined by the two characteristics; Throughput and delay. Throughput determines how much of an object can be delivered over a period of time and delay determines how long it takes to deliver an object. In this dissertation I present projects along these three areas of effort that accomplish the two goals (increase bandwidth and reduce delay) to achieve the purpose of improving the Internet's ability to deliver essential and life improving services. These projects and their organization into areas of effort, goals and purpose are my contributions to the networking sciences. The Internet has become a vital and essential part of modern everyday life. Services delivered by the Internet are used by people across the planet every moment of every day of the year. The Internet has proven a positive force for good improving the lives of billions of people worldwide. The power of the Internet to deliver this positive good to humanity relies on its ability to deliver life improving services. In my doctorate work culminating in this dissertation I have striven to sustain and increase the Internet's ability to deliver these services and to have a positive good effect upon humanity.",Chile,-71.542969,-35.675147,16

Economics",Economics,Christopher Costello,"Problems arising from the common-pool nature of fisheries are well known (Gordon 1954). Recent research estimates the lost economic benefits from suboptimal fisheries production to be on the order of $50 billion annually (Arnason et al. 2009). Among the most promising management tools for improving fisheries performance are closed areas (marine reserves) and rights-based management (catch shares) (Worm et al. 2009). This collection of essays examines the emergence and performance of these two policy tools from an economics perspective. The first chapter examines the determinants of the transition from command and control regulation to rights-based management in common-pool resources. I develop a conceptual framework describing a regulator's decision to adopt a rights-based management regime in a common-pool resource and empirically test the hypotheses advanced in the framework with a duration analysis of rights-based management program adoption in a group of federally managed Alaska fisheries. Consistent with the conceptual framework, I find that rent dissipation along input cost and product value dimensions increases likelihood of program adoption, and high transaction costs decrease likelihood of program adoption. I find mixed evidence that resource depletion increases probability of program adoption. The second chapter examines the capacity of marine reserves to function as a cooperation mechanism in transboundary fisheries, stocks shared by two or more jurisdictions. Using a game theoretic model, we find that marine reserve implementation can achieve first-best equilibrium economic outcomes. We illustrate our theoretical predictions with a case study of the Chilean loco fishery. The third chapter estimates the economic and biological outcomes of the implementation of a marine reserve network at the California Channel Islands in 2003 on the Santa Barbara Area red sea urchin fishery. The paper develops an integrated bioeconomic model of the fishery consisting of an age structured population model and a discrete choice model of fishermen behavior linked via the fishing mortality rate. We calibrate the model using a 15-year panel dataset of fishery data and use the calibrated model to simulate outcomes under a counterfactual no-reserve scenario. We find that eight years after reserve implementation, urchin biomass is 53.7% higher, fishery yield is 11.3% lower, and fishery revenue is 10.9% lower compared to simulated outcomes under a counterfactual no-reserve policy.",Chile,-71.542969,-35.675147,16

Analyses revealed that the degree of flexibility in the schooling system and the degree of individualism and collectivism of the social groups in which the students were learning science seemed to influence the informants' vocational decisions in three interrelated processes: (1) Deciding the informants' degree of interest and ability in science by the opportunity of choosing science classes and activities. The highly tracked Chilean system socializes students to science at an early age. The more flexible school system in the US enabled the interviewees to gradually decide about pursuing their interest in science; (2) Experiencing science as a collective learning process for the Chilean informants and an individualistic learning process for the US students; (3) Perceiving science differently at each life stage for both groups of interviewees including: Playing science, Studying science, Doing science, Working in science, Practicing Science in their doctoral programs.",Chile,-71.542969,-35.675147,16

Electrical and Computer Engineering",Electrical and Computer Engineering,Li-C. Wang,"In constrained random verification, when a simulation run of tests instantiated by a test template cannot reach the coverage goal, there are two possible reasons: insufficient simulation, and improper constraints and/or biases. There are three actions that a verification engineer can usually do to address the problem: to simulate more tests, to refine the test template, or to change to a new test template. Accordingly, we propose three data learning methodologies to help the engineers make more informed decisions in these three application scenarios and thus improve the verification efficiency. The first methodology identifies important (""novel"") tests before simulation based on what have been already simulated. By only simulating those novel tests and filtering out redundant tests, tremendous resources such as simulation cycles and licenses can be saved. The second methodology extracts the unique properties from those novel tests identified in simulation and uses them to refine the test template. By leveraging the extracted knowledge, more tests similar to the novel ones are generated. And thus the new tests are more likely to activate coverage events that are otherwise difficult to hit by extensive simulation. The third methodology analyses a collection of existing test items (test templates) and identifies feasible augmentation to the test plan. By automatically adding new test items based on the data analysis, it alleviates the manual efforts for closing coverage holes. The proposed data learning methodologies were developed and applied in the setting of verifying commercial microprocessor and SoC platform designs. The experiments in this dissertation were conducted in the verification environment of a commercial microprocessor and a SoC platform in Freescale Semiconductor Inc. and were in parallel with the on-going verification efforts. The experiment results demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of building learning frameworks to improve verification efficiency. Functional verification continues to be one of the most time-consuming steps in the chip design cycle. Simulation-based verification is well practised in industry thanks to its flexibility and scalability. The completeness of the verification is measured by coverage metrics. Generating effective tests to achieve a satisfactory coverage level is a difficult task in verification. Constrained random verification is commonly used to alleviate the manual efforts for producing direct tests. However, there are yet many situations where unnecessary verification efforts in terms of simulation cycles and man hours are spent. Also, it is observed that lots of data generated in existing constrained random verification process are barely analysed, and then discarded after simplistic correctness checking. Based on our previous research on data mining and exposure to the industrial verification process, we identify that there are opportunities in extracting knowledge from the constrained random verification data and use it to improve the verification efficiency.",Chile,-71.542969,-35.675147,16

Environmental Science and Management",Environmental Science and Management,Frank W. Davis,"Animal-mediated crop pollination is an essential ecosystem service for the production of 75% of globally important crops. In intensive agricultural production systems, this service is usually provided by managed honeybees, but wild bees are natural providers of this service and can enhance crop pollination even in the presence of honeybees. For the first chapter, I sampled pollinators associated with blueberry fields in south-central Chile and explore how landscape context can affect densities of queen bumblebee (Bombus terrestris), which is the most abundant wild pollinator found in these systems. Queen bumblebees can be positively affected by forest area and negatively affected by a high-food resource area (flowering crops that are attractive to pollinators). Both effects were strongest at spatial scales of 2500-meter radius distance. In the second chapter, I study the movement behavior of queen bumblebees foraging in blueberry fields. Observation data were used to link bumblebee densities to the number of times each flower in the field is visited by a bumblebee. A higher number of flower visits translates into larger fruit set/weight, up to a threshold at which pollen saturation occurs. Movement patterns were highly directional along blueberry rows, and individuals tended to move toward the nearest plants. Using movement models, I show that observed movement patterns translate into a relatively efficient crop pollination service provision compared to movement patterns with random directionality. In the last chapter, I explore how crop heterogeneity at the landscape scale can increase the provision of crop pollination services. Crop heterogeneity was specified by classifying crops according to their timing of flowering. Higher crop heterogeneity translates into a more continuous food supply that promotes colony growth. It also decreases the transient ""dilution"" effect which is the reduction of pollinator density with increasing flowering crop area.",Chile,-71.542969,-35.675147,16

Environmental Science and Management",Environmental Science and Management,Gary D. Libecap,"The first chapter explores how properties of an aquifer influence the incentives of groundwater irrigators to engage in collective management. Using data from Kansas, counties with high hydraulic conductivity, a measure of how ""common"" the groundwater resource is, are shown to benefit more from management, among other results. The chapter demonstrates the benefit of directing management based on physical properties of a resource. Institutions can emerge and evolve to solve environmental and natural resource problems. However, these resources are often characterized by scientific complexity, a lack of complete property rights, and dispersed benefits. Aligning private and social benefits and costs can increase total social welfare, but also requires increased control over the resource, which is costly. Increased control comes through strengthening property rights, which may be held by the state, by local user groups, individuals, or a combination. This dissertation explores how knowledge of the physical properties of a resource, and in particular groundwater, is critical to understanding the incentives to engage in bargaining over property rights, lobbying, or other management program. The third chapter presents interdisciplinary work that explores how outflows benefitting ecosystems may warrant maintaining groundwater tables at higher levels than private economic incentives would indicate. A case in northern Chile is examined. Here, a wetland and lacustrine environment and a village dependent on that environment disappeared due to water extraction for use in mining. The paper explores how economics and hydrology illustrate the inherent tradeoffs in this type of development. The second chapter explores how the separation of ground and surface water rights can create differences in preferences over policy alternatives, expressed through political channels. Economic efficiency may not be the key determinant of outcomes as affected parties interact with politicians and administrative agencies. An economic model is introduced to explore the political choice of the environmental good, instruments to be used (quantity restrictions, subsidies or taxes), or how costs will be distributed. A case analysis of water-trading/access restrictions on copper mining firms in northern Chile's Antofagasta Region illustrates the key points of a theoretical framework.",Chile,-71.542969,-35.675147,16

Three new caviomorph taxa have been identified (Cephalomys sp. nov., Erethizontidae Gen. et. sp. nov., Echimyidae Gen. et. sp. nov.), all more closely related to Colhuehuapian than to Deseadan forms. The fossil bearing horizons at El Volcan likely fall between Deseadan age and Colhuehuapian age between ~25 and 21 Ma.

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Phillip B. Gans,"Long-term (>10 Myr) spatial and temporal patterns of magmatism and upper crustal deformation along Andean-type subduction margins are poorly understood. New geologic mapping, petrographic observations, structural analysis, and 40Ar/39Ar and U-Pb zircon geochronology of the Abanico Formation in the Rio Tinguiririca region shed light on the long-term evolution of central Chile's subduction margin, and permit testing of opposing tectonic models for the southern Andes. Results indicate the Abanico Formation is ~3.6+ km thick in the Tinguiririca region and consists dominantly of volcanic and volcaniclastic strata, with subordinate epiclastic intervals; 40Ar/39Ar and U-Pb age data acquired for the Abanico Formation span the Late Cretaceous through Miocene (~74-11 Ma). Stratigraphic relationships within the Abanico Formation and the tight clustering of age data indicate that pulsed volcanism in the region was punctuated by long periods of emergence, erosion, and aggradation of volcaniclastic and epiclastic sediments, presumably in an intra-arc setting. A strong, generally N-S trending transpressional overprint deforms the Abanico and older map units. Radiometric dating of growth strata and an age correlated sill crosscutting fault propagation structures indicate that shortening was underway prior to the late Eocene and continued through the late Miocene, coeval with continued magmatism. Collectively, results from this study significantly revise previously proposed chronologies of magmatism, sedimentation, and deformation within this sector of the Andes. 40Ar/39Ar geochronology was critical to dating mafic to intermediate volcanic rocks examined in this study. The primary phases used in 40Ar/39Ar dating are highly susceptible to low grade and/or hydrothermal alteration that can frequently be difficult to identify in hand sample or thin section, however. Electron microscopy was employed in this study to assess the extent of alteration and the potassium distribution within six volcanic samples whose corresponding 40Ar/39Ar spectra range from slightly to strongly disturbed. Results indicate that both alteration and potassium distribution within a sample exert a first order control on the Ar isotope systematics, and that electron microscopy is highly effective for screening samples for 40Ar/39Ar geochronology.",Chile,-71.542969,-35.675147,16

Global and International Studies",Global and International Studies,Javiera Barandiaran,"The concept of food security that global institutions, such as the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO), have emphasized for decades does not promote the engagement of people suffering from hunger and poverty. Food sovereignty, on the other hand, advocates for people having complete control of their local food system. This concept is meant to return power to the people worldwide that are producing the majority of the global food supply, despite the dominance of industrial agriculture in global export markets. Food sovereignty also supports the use of local and traditional agricultural knowledge as part of developing and maintaining successful food systems, while food security does not specifically support such knowledge and instead promotes simply ""knowledge of basic nutrition and care"" (""Food Security"", n.d.). This thesis will first provide a brief historical background of the role of agriculture in Chilean development, discuss the main arguments for why small-scale agriculture is more sustainable than large-scale industrial agriculture, and explore the connections between the concepts of traditional ecological knowledge and food sovereignty. Second, a brief history of the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) will be outlined, tracing its evolution from its inception in 1945 until today. The FAO is in the midst of reform and its changing attitudes have paved the way for new initiatives, such as the Globally Important Agricultural Heritage System (GIAHS) initiative. The third chapter concentrates on the region of Chiloe, a GIAHS site in southern Chile. This chapter aims to demonstrate the following: 1) the structure of the GIAHS initiative in Chiloe and its main objectives in the region, 2) the challenges this initiative faces within Chiloe, and 3) how the valuation of agricultural heritage can help support an alternative model of agricultural development within the region. Rethinking the concept of food security as food sovereignty can help put power back into hands of local producers and consumers and thus promote more culturally-appropriate food systems and the development of policies that better support small-scale producers. Though the FAO's GIAHS initiative is still new and there are not yet results as to whether it will help increase valuation of traditional agriculture and its products, it is still an example of an alternative development paradigm and how this alternative, typically associated with grassroots peasants' movements, NGOs and bottom-up approaches, has made its way to the institutional level.",Chile,-71.542969,-35.675147,16

History",History,Randolph Bergstrom,"The Public History of a Concentration Camp: Historical Tales of Tragedy and Hope at the National Stadium of Chile does this and, in doing so, contributes to the stadium camp's history in unique ways. A public history lens provides fresh perspectives on the production of historic work at and memories of the National Stadium-as-concentratin camp over forty years (1973-2013). Its focus on popularly constructed narratives' interaction with official silences and versions demonstrates both how and why stadium stakeholders---especially from the residual---have constructed the tales of tragedy and hope. As it focuses on this popular historical work The Public History of a Concentration Camp has focused, too, on the formative power of the specific place in the formation of public memory. Rather than begin with selected processes or events and look for places where they unfolded and happened, this study gains insight from joining public and popular practitioners who begin at a specific place and ask: what happened here? The unique public and place-based approach also joins recent conversations concerning historic sites of conscience not only in Chile but worldwide. Framing the popular historical work at the stadium generally and its complicated human rights museum 'National Stadium, National Memory' specifically against the backdrop of the sites of memory in Chile offers context for local interpretation of human rights as much as the reciprocal relationship between these organic understandings and international conventions. The Public History of a Concentration: Historical Tales of Tragedy and Hope at the National Stadium of Chile continues this important historical trajectory in the form of a scholarly monograph, only made possible through the popular work that has preceded it. On September 11, 1973, forces of evil converted the National Stadium of Chile into a concentration camp. That day, the nation's military and security forces overthrew the constitutionally elected government of President Salvador Allende Gossens. For the next fifty-eight days thousands of Chileans and hundreds of foreigners experienced violations of human dignity, physical integrity, and political consciousness. The stadium became the physical and figurative starting point for seventeen years of state-sponsored terrorism under the regime of Augusto Pinochet. Today, though, this is hardly a secret, as stories of the stadium-as-concentration camp have circulated since 1973 to the present in testimonies and memoirs, truth commissions and international reports, newspaper and media accounts, documentaries and movies, and ephemeral commemorations and permanent memorials. At different times, in different ways, and for different reasons, former stadium prisoners, human rights activists, journalists, judges, state officials, and scholars have sounded off, sometimes in a complementary fashion, other times to clash. Despite the volumes of searchable material (books, memoirs, testimonies) and less tangible but equally telling commemorative events (vigils, theater productions, public art) that continue at the stadium, no single work has attempted to synthesize, organize, and analyze this historic corpus.",Chile,-71.542969,-35.675147,16

However, little work has been done to place these student movements into a broader historical context. Historically, Chilean students have had a long record of both general political activism and specific activism over educational matters dating back over 100 years. Even the most recent student protests, which developed into a broader movement against the neoliberal policies implemented under the dictator General Augusto Pinochet, were preceded by demonstrations with similar demands dating back to at least 2000. However, these precedents do not explain why the movements developed between 2000 and 2011, rather than immediately after the fall of the dictatorship in 1990. I argue that part of the reason is because that the students in the twenty-first century were the first ones to attend high school and college who were not raised under the dictatorship and for that reason they did not fear the repression and violence their predecessors, who grew up predominantly under the dictatorship, experienced. Thus, an analysis of the history of student political activism in Chile, the history of Chilean politics, the history of the Chilean education system, and the neoliberal reforms, especially in education, is necessary to provide a historical, political, and social context for the recent student movements.",Chile,-71.542969,-35.675147,16

Mechanical Engineering",Mechanical Engineering,Francesco Bullo,"Pulse coupled oscillator (PCO) networks consist of oscillators that send pulses to their in-neighbors on the network, as defined by the sensing digraph. The neighbors update their phase when they receive the pulse, depending on their current phase and the pulse strength. This mechanism causes the oscillators to synchronize for some values of their initial phases, and to converge to an asynchronous state with a fixed phase difference for other values of their initial phases. The synchronizing behavior due to pulse coupling has been observed in nature: fireflies tend to flash in unison, and neurons and cardiac cells synchronize their firing with their neighboring cells by this mechanism. There has been recent interest in developing algorithms based on PCO networks to synchronize the clocks for distributed sensing and robotic applications. PCO networks whose sensing digraphs are strongly connected have been modeled extensively, in the presence and absence of delays in the transmissions of pulses, using analytical and numerical approaches. We model a PCO network whose sensing digraph is not necessarily strongly connected but satisfies the weaker condition of having a globally reachable node. We propose a simple model of PCO networks with identical frequencies, based on the approach used in the study of distributed consensus. We model the discrete dynamics of the network as a linear time-varying (LTV) system. We use the row-stochastic property of the weighted adjacency matrices that characterize the LTV system, to derive sufficient conditions for synchrony. Arbitrary delays in the pulse-transmission are modeled as disturbances. Synchrony may not be reached exactly in the presence of delays, and error that remains in the phases in the steady state is proportional to the maximum delay. Further, we observe the convergence to be exponential if sampled over a sufficiently large number of receptions, and estimate the rate of convergence based on the properties of the digraph. We also estimate the basin of attraction of the synchronized solution. We illustrate these results with numerical examples.",Chile,-71.542969,-35.675147,16

I examine the emergence of a new generation of citizens, completely socialized during democracy, who are using unconventional participation channels to affect the public agenda. Using survey data collected in Chile from 1990 to 2011 I unearth the differences in political attitudes and behaviors of three generations of Chileans. I find that the characterization of Chilean youth as pervasively apathetic does not hold if analyzed under a more expansive view of citizenship.

This dissertation deals with the fictional works of Chilean writer Roberto Bolano, focusing largely on the narrative esthetics brought into play by the writer in his extensive oeuvre. This dissertation analyzes the esthetic resources that allow the author to construct a fictional self-representation that is manifested in the character Arturo Belano. This character functions as an ethical discourse on what Bolano considers the `true poet', which is an idealization of what the Latin-American writer `should be'. In other words, I explore how an ethical discourse can be originated from the esthetical construction of a fictional alter ego. In my dissertation, I analyze what elements are finely carved in Roberto Bolano's fictions, as a part of an intentionality to convey an ontological meaning for his and his group's place in the Hispanic American literary tradition.

Asian Studies",Asian Studies,Michael S. Berry,"Bruce Lee is a martial arts action star whose enduring screen image has lasted many decades beyond his death, and this is partially due to the numerous clones that came out after the star's premature death in 1973. These clones and various spin-offs of Lee's life's works resulted in the phenomenon dubbed ""Bruceploitation."" As time passed, the Bruceploitation phenomenon slowed down, but more recently there has been an interest in Bruce Lee's life with various films and television series that attempt to tell the life story of the actor, especially with his family's involvement. While earlier forms of Bruceploitation films strove to exploit Lee's image for financial profits, these more recent works do not seem to exploit Lee in the same way. In particular, Bruceploitation in more recent works aims to exploit the martial arts star's narrative to associate his persona with specific ideologies. I argue, however, that the more recent television series by China Central Television, The Legend of Bruce Lee, is in fact following in the legacy of Bruceploitation in that this category of texts is not only about making money without the consent of the star, but it is rooted in the act of exploitation, which redefined the image of Bruce Lee in a national Chinese context. Although the CCTV series may not look for financial profits as its main goal through the perpetuation of Lee's narrative, it is exploiting his image for ideological purposes. In particular, the series exploits Lee's image to assert national Chinese power in a global context, which can be seen through the production practices, circulation of the series, and the construction of specific scenes throughout the series.",China,104.195397,35.86166,49

Economics",Economics,Peter Rupert,"My dissertation studies the sectoral and regional reallocation of capital and labor for an economy in transition using general equilibrium model framework. The first chapter, ''Capital in Transition: Housing and Sectoral Reallocation in the Long Run'', studies the sectoral allocation of capital between housing and non-residential sectors using a two-sector general equilibrium model in a neoclassical growth environment. Calibrated to both the United States and China, the model can account for both the positive correlation between the share of housing capital and the consumption-output ratio in the United States and the negative correlation between the share of housing capital and the consumption-output ratio in China. The calibration to the Chinese economy implies that the rapid increase in the share of housing capital and the simultaneous decrease in the consumption-output ratio observed in China can be rationalized by a combination of three factors: a high elasticity of substitution between the two sectors, a high capital intensity of production of the housing sector, and a low initial share of housing capital before the Chinese housing market reform. This paper provides a tractable framework to understand the sectoral allocation of capital between housing and non-residential sectors across countries. The second chapter, ''Human Capital Spillover and Housing price'', provides a model framework to study the relationship between the external effect of human capital and housing price growth in the SEZ economy in China. In a two-region model, high wage in the SEZ region reflects high level of human capital, and these jobs are not available to low human capital migrants from the non-SEZ economy. The migrants come to the SEZ economy for two reasons: on the one hand, the SEZ economy is a better place to accumulate human capital and earn a higher wage in the future; on the other hand, the SEZ economy has a better amenities for living. In the baseline model with migration, the share of population that choose to migrate to the SEZ economy is determined by the utility equalization between living in either economy. In the baseline model, the migration occurs all at once at the first period. Further, I extend the baseline model by incorporating the spillover effect of human capital: time invested in human capital accumulation has a higher return in high human capital environment. In this case, the migration to the SEZ economy becomes increasingly attractive as the gap between the human capital leaders and followers increase. By comparing the extended model with the baseline, I capture the significant positive impact of human capital spillover on the increase of housing prices. The third chapter, ''Dynamic Arrow-Debreu Economy for General Equilibrium Analysis'', coauthored with Cheng-Zhong Qin, develops a dynamic Arrow-Debreu abstract economy to more closely capture the timing of moves of Walrasian general equilibrium model. Instead of inducing a pseudo game, the extensive form of the dynamic Arrow-Debreu abstract economy is well defined. As such, various game-theoretic solutions with and without symmetric information can be applied. We show that the set of subgame-perfect equilibrium allocations coincides with the set of Walrasian equilibrium allocations when information is symmetric. The set of perfect Bayesian equilibrium allocations coincides with the set of rational expectations equilibrium allocations when information is asymmetric. These results are useful for analyzing and refining Walrasian and rational expectations equilibrium allocations.",China,104.195397,35.86166,49

The first essay explores the productivity differential between return migrants (""Sea Turtles"") and non-migrants through a case study of China's venture capital (VC) industry. I find that even after correcting for selection bias, return venture capitalists are less productive than comparable non-migrants in targeting promising projects and/or providing value-added services. Given that the VC industry is a useful laboratory in which to look at the performance of return migrants and China's economic development, I discuss why the presumably better human capital accumulated overseas does not translate into productivity in the Chinese market, and how related policies could reverse this situation in the long run. The second essay exploits panel data and large, abrupt, and unusual dislocations of Indonesian workers in the wake of the Asian Financial Crisis to investigate the robustness and persistence of inter-industry wage differentials (IWDs). Unobserved worker characteristics explain 36% of IWDs. IWDs persist through the post-crisis decade, although, consistent with a rent-sharing explanation, they shift alongside sectors' terms of trade in the wake of the crisis. Agriculture pays a wage penalty, and manufacturing sector a statistically significant but small premium. Most IWDs do not seem to be driven by minimum wage laws, worker monitoring costs, the disagreeability of the work, job-specific skills, industry-specific human capital, non-wage benefits or contracting terms. In the third essay, the author examines the reduced-form relationship between the venture capital (VC) penetration and the embodied technological change (through the growth of capital services) and the disembodied technological change (through the growth of the total factor productivity (TFP)) at the sectoral level in the US. Combining various datasets from EU-KLEMS, PwC MoneyTree Report and STAN and applying various econometric strategies suitable for dynamic panel data, the author finds that the VC accessibility is positively associated with the capital service/TFP growth contemporarily, but that it is negatively correlated with them in the following years.",China,104.195397,35.86166,49

Chapter 2 Abstract: When permitted by law and custom, employers sometimes engage in ex ante screening of job candidates using demographic criteria like age and gender. We study this practice using four samples of job ads, taken from job boards in China and Mexico. Consistent with Kuhn and Shen's (2013) screening cost model, we find a strong, negative skill-targeting relationship in all four data sets: employers are less likely to express an explicit age or gender preference in a job ad as the job's skill requirements rise. We also find that employers' age and gender preferences interact in a strong and consistent way across all four data sets: relative to women, men's (revealed) desirability as workers rises dramatically between the ages of 18 and 40. While some of this pattern can be linked to an age-dependent demand for feminine beauty and to gender differences in firms' marital status preferences, other aspects of the pattern are harder to explain. Chapter 3 Abstract: The escalation in violence in recent years resulting from the Mexican government's war on drug trafficking has caused a large and unprecedented increase in workplace fatality risk for workers in Mexico.

English",English,Janis Caldwell,"In 1822, just before Christmas, London publisher Rudolph Ackermann produced a beautiful volume called Forget-Me-Not: A Christmas and New Year's Present for 1823. Filled with pictures accompanied by poetry, the Forget-Me-Not inspired myriad imitators, known collectively as literary annuals. By the early 1830s, the Forget-Me-Not and its roughly one hundred competitors---each selling edition sizes in the thousands if not tens of thousands---were given by their purchasers as holiday gifts to friends or family. Despite literary annuals' popularity, which lasted into the 1850s, their peculiar media conventions and contributions to contemporary cultural discourse have not been well understood. This dissertation recovers literary annuals' significance through the relationship between texts and images in their pages. Typically, annuals' editors began with pictures (usually steel-plate engravings), and then hired contributing authors to write poetry or prose to accompany each one. I examine annuals' use of ekphrasis---or in the annuals' terms, ""poetical illustration""---as it is understood in neuroscientific and psychoanalytic studies: as an artistic display of proprioceptive or cross-modal thinking, processes that are central to one's ability to differentiate oneself from others, and which allow for inter-subjective experience as well. I also incorporate analyses of ekphrasis that compare the text's approach to the image with the self's approach to otherness, as well as accounts that emphasize the importance of affect in the interpretation of images. From this standpoint I consider in detail annuals' contributions to two overlapping discourses in early 19th-century Britain: the development of a national historiography that comprehended the increasingly politically-empowered middle class (annuals' primary audience), and the development of British imperialism in Asia, particularly India and China. By looking at topical trends in several of the longest-running literary annuals over time, including the Oriental Annual, Finden's Tableaux, Fisher's Drawing Room Scrapbook, and The Keepsake, I show how the multimedia practice of ""poetical illustration"" facilitated improvisational engagements with historiographic and imperialist discourses. By closely reading several annuals, I demonstrate their social contribution beyond their circulation as gifts. In their unique employment of ekphrasis, they characterized the production of Britain's self-image as contingent, improvisational, and constantly negotiable.",China,104.195397,35.86166,49

English",English,Shirley Geok-lin Lim,"This dissertation looks at theories of hope and utopia in the works of transnational and first-generation Chinese American authors from 1945-2010. By beginning after the Maoist Revolution and the Second Sino-Japanese War, this project follows the development of the transnational and first-generation new immigrant through the works of Lin Yutang, Li-Young Lee, Nieh Hualing, Ha Jin, and Wang Ping. In addressing these authors the dissertation considers how they have sought to leave behind the social and political conditions prevailing in China then, to journey across the Pacific and thence to imagine and author worlds different from their original sources. How do writers fictionalize migration and land-orientation to signal the emergence of a new hope, one less nation-based and instead invested in a global identity? These texts engage histories of Chinese Communism, American capitalism, and American democracy, and their re-imagined representations of these issues arguably have helped shape the new transnational immigrant sensibility in U.S. literary studies. The dissertation examines the resilience of hope as a re-generative affect in the social imaginary drawn in these texts when dreams of financial success, political freedom and upward social mobility fall short. As failure is dramatized and thematized, hope as a motivating idea becomes more and more situated in the immaterial world, and this alternative productively complicates the theories of utopia and hope that I review in this thesis. Studying immigrant attempts to achieve a utopia ""of one's own"" puts pressure on the US as a presumed utopian site and re-frames the conventional image of the country as a promised land. While the dissertation focuses on a select Chinese American canon as a signifier for a national shift in global identity, this focus, I argue, enables a larger investigation into and sustained discourse on the representations of hope in contemporary and ethnic U.S. writing.",China,104.195397,35.86166,49

Geography",Geography,Bodo Bookhagen,"High Mountain Asia (HMA) has been strongly impacted by climate change, and will continue to be impacted by diverse climate stressors in the coming years. A combination of changing weather patterns and retreating glaciers has begun to impact water resources in the region; the rate, extent, and mechanisms behind these changes are poorly quantified due to a lack of data and process understanding. As rivers sourced in HMA feed more than a billion people in the region, increased understanding of climate impacts on regional hydrology is essential for effective water management. Glaciers play a diverse role in hydrology throughout the range, with some catchments having little to no reliance on glacial meltwater, and some catchments receiving almost all of their water from glaciers. This study aims to decipher the impact of climate change on glaciers in the Tien Shan mountain range, a large and understudied region that extends roughly 2,800 km northeast from the Pamir Knot in Tajikistan through China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Mongolia towards the Altai Mountains. As glacial area extents do not present a complete picture of the impacts of climate change on glaciers, the author undertook a pilot study to examine the mass balances of glaciers throughout the range. Mass balance estimates are a proxy for changes in water equivalent stored in a glacier, and are thus essential measurements for understanding the hydrology of the range. The author presents preliminary evidence that high elevation areas in the Tien Shan are thickening, even in the context of retreating glacial tongues. This implies an overall gain of ice mass in the region, despite generally retreating glaciers. This trend was linked to recent increases in precipitation in the range, as well as increases in air temperature. There is not yet enough data to unravel changes in glacier mass balance across the range, although the author predicts that the recently coined 'Karakoram Anomaly' may in fact need to be renamed to include both the Pamir and the western Tien Shan. After validating the algorithm against multiple manually digitized control datasets, the author applied it to a study area encompassing six Landsat scene footprints along the strike of the Tien Shan Orogen. A statistically significant, though minor, gradient in glacier retreat was found, where those glaciers in the west of the range have retreated less than those glaciers in the east. This gradient is explained by differences in regional climate, where large winter storms tend to arrive from the west and break apart and weaken before moving towards the eastern edge of the range. This is substantiated by differences in mean annual precipitation, as derived from Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) 3B43 V7 data, as well as differences in atmospheric lapse rates, where the western region of the range remains cold year-round and the more eastern edges have larger annual temperature fluctuations, as well as a lower overall lapse rate, which implies higher temperatures at higher elevations. Previous studies in the region lack the data to decipher gradients in glacial retreat across the range. To address this data deficit, the author designed and implemented a glacial mapping algorithm which delineates both clean glacial ice---methods which are well documented---and glacial debris tongues, which often require extensive manual digitization. This research is the most significant part of the thesis, and improves upon methods developed to automatically delineate glacial areas using spectral, topographic, velocity, and spatial relationships. The author found that the algorithm misclassifies between 2 and 10% of glacial areas, compared to a ~700 glacier control dataset. These results show significant improvement over previously used methods, as well as large-scale glacier databases such as the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI) which are commonly used in mountain-belt scale studies of glaciers.",China,104.195397,35.86166,49

To address this question, I examine household land use and protected area (PA) policy goals, as mediated and informed by local management dynamics, household livelihood strategies and ecological knowledge. A satisfactory pursuit of this question requires an examination of how people weigh conservation and livelihood choices in settings of limited livelihood options. I examine land change, livelihoods, and environmental perception in the context of reforestation policy implementation in Fanjingshan National Nature Reserve (FNNR), China. I use a mixed methods approach to address the following three objectives at the landscape (objective 1) and household (objectives 2 and 3) scales: 1) Evaluate where and how forest change may have occurred in and around golden monkey habitat between 1996 and 2009. 2) Ascertain how (if at all) household-level socio-economic factors and crop damage explain variation in household-level reforestation. 3) Determine the extent (if at all) to which Sloped Land Conversion Program (SLCP) participation or other factors (land use, livelihood, demographics, conservation policy) relate to local perception of human impact on the environment. Methods integrate remote sensing, geographic information systems, landscape metrics, a semi-structured household survey, interviews with key village and reserve personnel, and logistic and ordered multinomial modeling. Results indicate the reserve contains more connected forest cover than surrounding areas but also highlight areas of potential concern for conservation sustainability. Overall, the reserve appears to benefit from the support of local residents. However, results also raise questions about the efficacy of a major reforestation program, the Sloped Land Conversion Program (SLCP) and reveal areas of concern for reserve management. Specifically, evidence does not indicate success in achieving the dual SLCP program goals of reforestation and poverty alleviation. In addition, ethnic minorities appear to be increasingly enrolling land in the program with varying outcomes for coupled livelihood and monkey habitat sustainability. Some ethnic minorities, particularly the Tujia, are associated with higher household reforestation levels than the Han majority and Miao minority, and reforestation participation may be related to ethnic minority-majority and minority-minority inequality. The relative household-level allocation of reforestation species---mainly pine, fir, bamboo, and tea, also appears related to ethnicity. This has an implication for livelihoods since tea can be a lucrative crop while wild pig damage is more concentrated among bamboo reforestation types, affecting the potential positive impacts of reduced wild pig damage associated with reduced cropland. Finally, environmental awareness of local residents may be limited without direct experience with the golden monkey, or even negative when crops are damaged by wild pigs.

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Syee Weldeab,"Most of our knowledge about the history of Indian and Asian monsoons has relied on delta18O records extracted from cave deposits in India and China. While these records are highly resolved and have the most robust age models, the reliance on a single proxy, delta18O, as an indicator of changes in precipitation amount harbors significant uncertainty. This is due to the difficulty in separating the various components influencing calcareous delta18O records. Here we present an independent and spatially integrated measure of past Indian summer monsoon precipitation extracted from a sediment sequence recovered from the northern Bay of Bengal, an area within a runoff-induced low salinity plume. The focus is on the time window spanning Termination II and Marine Isotope Stage 5 (145-70 kyr BP). We use delta18O, Ba/Ca, and Mg/Ca analyzed in tests of the surface-dwelling planktonic foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber (white). Comparison of the temperature and ice volume corrected delta 18Osw record with the Ba/Ca record, a proxy for runoff, shows important differences. Consistent with the Kutzbach's hypothesis (Kutzbach, 1981), the Ba/Ca record indicates that strong monsoon intensities correspond with strong northern hemisphere summer insolation with a decreasing trend from strongest monsoon during MIS 5e (~130 kyr BP) and weakest during MIS 5a (80 kyr BP). In contrast, delta18Osw shows monsoon runoff to be comparable or stronger during MIS 5c and 5a relative to 5e. The delta18O-based observation shares some commonality with the results of East Asian and West African monsoon reconstructions. We removed the delta18Osw component related to runoff amount from the delta18Osw record and obtained delta 18Oresidual, which due to the setting we primarily interpret to reflect changes in the delta18O of precipitation (delta 18Oprecipitation). delta18Oprecipitation is significantly depleted during MIS 5a and 5c relative to 5e and enriched during Termination II. Variations in the delta18O of precipitation in the Indian and East Asian domains, likely result from changes in moisture source, pathway, and the seasonality of precipitation. The major result of this study lies in revealing a large-scale imprint in calcareous delta 18O archives unrelated to the amount of precipitation and establishing an independent record of ISM precipitation during the last interglacial.",China,104.195397,35.86166,49

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Susannah M. Porter,"Phosphatized and phosphatic small shelly fossils are a major source of information about Cambrian animal evolution, but many remain enigmatic, both with regard to their phylogenetic affinities and the overall morphology of the animal from which they came. Four studies on these fossils are presented. First, Cambrothyra is a jar-shaped fossil that has often been interpreted as a protistan test, but a detailed redescription based on specimens from the lower Cambrian of southern Shaanxi Province, China, supports the identification of it as the sclerite of a coeloscleritophoran, a problematic group of Cambrian scleritome-bearing metazoans. In particular, Cambrothyra resembles chancelloriids, but differs from them in having simple rather than compound sclerites. Second, results are presented on large samples of chancelloriid sclerites from the Meishucunian of eastern Yunnan Province, China (Dahai Member, Zhujiaqing Formation, and Shiyantou Formation). The material from the Dahai Member appears to come from a single species, while statistical analysis of morphotype co-occurrences in different samples suggests that at least four species are present in the Shiyantou Formation. The species from the Dahai Member is among the oldest well-characterized chancelloriids, and the irregularity and poor organization of its sclerites compared to those of younger forms support the hypothesis that chancelloriid sclerites are compound structures arising from the fusion of originally separate elements. In the third study, two further fossils are described from the Xihaoping Member: a cap-shaped fossil with a spine on its lower surface, and Acidocharacus, a tall spine, often bearing barbs, attached to a rounded conical base. Both of these fossils appear to be sclerites and may have functioned as attachment sites for soft tissues, but their affinities remain unknown. Finally, new microstructural data are presented for hyoliths, a group of problematic calcareous fossils, based on material from the middle Cambrian Gowers Formation of Queensland. These preserve a lamello-fibrillar microstructure reminiscent of both some molluscs and some annelids. Because of the convergent evolution of lamello-fibrillar microstructures in different groups of animals, it does not offer clear support for any particular phylogenetic position for hyoliths; instead, this plywood-like microstructure probably evolved to strengthen the shell against predators.",China,104.195397,35.86166,49

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Chen Ji,"This dissertation focuses on the slip history of two well-observed devastating earthquakes: the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan, China event and the 2011 Mw 9.1 Tohoku-Oki, Japan event. We adopt a non-linear finite inversion code, developed by Ji et al. [2003], to image the kinematic rupture processes of those two earthquakes by jointly modeling seismic waveforms and geodetic measurements. Our results indicate that the Wenchuan earthquake simultaneously ruptured two sub-parallel faults with about 100 km on the low-angle Pengguan Fault and about 270 km on the high-angle Beichuan Fault. The rupture initiated at the intersection between those two faults and propagated only on the lower potion of the Pengguan Fault in the first 16 s. It then triggered the rupture on the Beichuan Fault about 40 km northeast of the hypocenter, where the Xiaoyudong Fault intersects those two faults on the surface. Although the Xiaoyudong Fault did not experience significant slip during the Wenchuan earthquake, it might act as a local tectonic boundary as inferred from the aftershocks and their focal mechanisms. For the Tohoku-Oki earthquake, our preferred model suggests that it has broken a big near-trench asperity with a peak slip up to 60 m. It re-ruptured the slip region of its March 9th M7 foreshock with a much larger slip, rise time, and slip velocity. One possible scenario model for this kind of foreshock-mainshock sequence is that the foreshock had only ruptured a relatively weaker patch inside a strongly coupled asperity, and the giant Tohoku-Oki event broke the strong asperity and released the deficit slip in the foreshock slip region. In addition to resolving the slip distributions for realistic earthquakes, we used the earthquake source inversion validation BlindTest 1 to investigate uncertainties associated with earthquake inversions based on strong motion data. Our results suggest that the fault slip and rise time distributions of the BlindTest 1 can be well constrained, but inversions using the variance reduction function of velocity waveforms as the objective function have low sensitivity to the total seismic moment and peak slip. Therefore, it is crucial for source studies to develop new inversion schemes that can properly honor the frequency and time dependent energy distribution of seismic radiation.",China,104.195397,35.86166,49

In the third study, two further fossils are described from the Xihaoping Member: a cap-shaped fossil with a spine on its lower surface, and Acidocharacus, a tall spine, often bearing barbs, attached to a rounded conical base. Both of these fossils appear to be sclerites and may have functioned as attachment sites for soft tissues, but their affinities remain unknown. Finally, new microstructural data are presented for hyoliths, a group of problematic calcareous fossils, based on material from the middle Cambrian Gowers Formation of Queensland. These preserve a lamello-fibrillar microstructure reminiscent of both some molluscs and some annelids. Because of the convergent evolution of lamello-fibrillar microstructures in different groups of animals, it does not offer clear support for any particular phylogenetic position for hyoliths; instead, this plywood-like microstructure probably evolved to strengthen the shell against predators.",China,104.195397,35.86166,49

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Chen Ji,"This dissertation focuses on the slip history of two well-observed devastating earthquakes: the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan, China event and the 2011 Mw 9.1 Tohoku-Oki, Japan event. We adopt a non-linear finite inversion code, developed by Ji et al. [2003], to image the kinematic rupture processes of those two earthquakes by jointly modeling seismic waveforms and geodetic measurements. Our results indicate that the Wenchuan earthquake simultaneously ruptured two sub-parallel faults with about 100 km on the low-angle Pengguan Fault and about 270 km on the high-angle Beichuan Fault. The rupture initiated at the intersection between those two faults and propagated only on the lower potion of the Pengguan Fault in the first 16 s. It then triggered the rupture on the Beichuan Fault about 40 km northeast of the hypocenter, where the Xiaoyudong Fault intersects those two faults on the surface. Although the Xiaoyudong Fault did not experience significant slip during the Wenchuan earthquake, it might act as a local tectonic boundary as inferred from the aftershocks and their focal mechanisms. For the Tohoku-Oki earthquake, our preferred model suggests that it has broken a big near-trench asperity with a peak slip up to 60 m. It re-ruptured the slip region of its March 9th M7 foreshock with a much larger slip, rise time, and slip velocity. One possible scenario model for this kind of foreshock-mainshock sequence is that the foreshock had only ruptured a relatively weaker patch inside a strongly coupled asperity, and the giant Tohoku-Oki event broke the strong asperity and released the deficit slip in the foreshock slip region. In addition to resolving the slip distributions for realistic earthquakes, we used the earthquake source inversion validation BlindTest 1 to investigate uncertainties associated with earthquake inversions based on strong motion data. Our results suggest that the fault slip and rise time distributions of the BlindTest 1 can be well constrained, but inversions using the variance reduction function of velocity waveforms as the objective function have low sensitivity to the total seismic moment and peak slip. Therefore, it is crucial for source studies to develop new inversion schemes that can properly honor the frequency and time dependent energy distribution of seismic radiation.",China,104.195397,35.86166,49

History",History,Elizabeth DePalma Digeser,"This work argues that the presence of ""alchemical"" and ""magical"" material found in papyri dated to the third or fourth century CE must be related to the declining local aristocracy of the Roman empire and to their educated clients. Jacco Dieleman, Ian Moyer and mostly David Frankfurter, first described the Greek and Demotic Magical Papyri (part of the Anastasi papyri collection) as the work of Egyptian priests responding to the wishes of Greco-Roman aristocrats who traveled to Egypt in search of mageia . The conclusion of my work suggests two alternative modifications to the current interpretive framework: either (1) the Anastasi papyri were not solely the work of Egyptian priests but also of a social group of ""dependent scholars,"" men trained in Greek learning but economically dependent, and thus associated with a patron; or (2) from a socio-economic point of view, there was practically no difference between many late antique ""Greco-Egyptian priests"" and ""dependent scholars"" who used handbooks of recipes to maintain or promote the status of their patrons (alternatively the patrons could very well have used the books themselves). Persian philosophy (mageia) was a popular topic of study among late antique philosophers and we should expect ancient education to have generally accepted research on the magoi as a valid topic of inquiry (chapter one). A misunderstanding of the subject of ""magical"" study in turn pushed patrons to ask their dependent scholars for curses and divination (chapter two). Scholars (e.g. Apion ""Pleistonikes"") who were known as sorcerers were generally attached to patrons, involved in sympotic entertainment (esp. in the form of paignia) and in natural philosophy (chapter three). Comparing dependent scholars with each other shows that they read or wrote recipes that were considered to be magical by more established scholars (chapter four). The presence of paignia and of other performance-related recipes in the Anastasi papyri strongly suggests the kind of sympotic environment and of intellectual patronage referred to in the preceding chapters (chapter five). The same conclusion must be drawn a fortiori for P. Leid. and P. Holm., which are constituted of recipes for the counterfeiting of luxury items (chapter six).",China,104.195397,35.86166,49

European-Mongol Relations in the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries,2013,"Ho, Colleen Chi-Wei","University of California, Santa Barbara. History",History,Carol Lansing,"This dissertation is an analysis of how Europe responded to the Mongols in the thirteenth- and fourteenth-centuries. In only sixty years the Mongols created the largest land empire the world has ever seen. After Mongol attacks on Eastern Europe---specifically Russia, Poland, Hungary, and the Balkans---in the 1230s--1240s, Europeans were petrified of the terrifying and unfamiliar invaders. However, at times this initial anxiety waned and even turned to hope for a European alliance with the Mongols against Muslim powers like the Mamluks of Egypt. Using travel narratives of missionaries who traveled in Mongol territories, diplomatic correspondence between khans, popes, and kings, evidence of panni tartarici (Tartar silk) in Europe, theological treatises, and tombstones of Europeans who died in Yuan China, I challenge a secondary literature that tends to portray European-Mongol relations during this period as static. I show how European understandings of the Mongols varied greatly and depended on contemporary political events. I argue that medieval Europeans saw the Mongols as both threat and ally, as a sign of the Apocalypse and a partner in the fight against Islam. These sentiments were not mutually exclusive. This study contributes to studies of world history and understandings of pre-modern transnational relations. Its diverse sources illustrate the complexity of European attitudes towards the Mongols, and demonstrate how important an interdisciplinary approach is for the study of the Mongol Empire.",China,104.195397,35.86166,49

Topic-comment structures and zero anaphora are frequent, regularly creating utterances in which key information is underspecified or absent. Some constructions, such as pragmatic agent marking, are triggered only when the context is ambiguous. And, many particles and constructions in Khatso are multifunctional, relying on context to clarify meaning. Essentially, syntax sets the stage for several potential interpretations and only the flow of information in a specific utterance points to the correct choice. Moreover, some constructions are only identifiable through contextual analysis, such as the many clause-combining structures that link phrases pragmatically without syntactic integration. Consequently, the discourse-functional approach used here has proven especially useful for painting a comprehensive picture of the Khatso language. The research and analysis presented in this dissertation differ significantly from previous efforts to describe the language. In addition to identifying the basic building blocks - phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax and the lexicon - there is an emphasis on capturing Khatso the way it is spoken in daily life. Natural language data were gathered during nearly a year of fieldwork in Xingmeng, via both audio and video recordings, creating a large multimedia corpus of the language. Transcriptions of the recordings formed the foundation for the investigation, which follows a discourse-functional approach to linguistic analysis. As a result, this grammar is the most comprehensive analysis of Khatso yet, providing an in-depth look at the features, structures and systems that interact to comprise this unique language. It is also the first major study of the language in English. Khatso (kha55tso31 [special characters omitted]; also Katso, Kazhuo [special characters omitted], Gazhuo [special characters omitted] and Yunnan Mongolian; ISO 639-3:kaf) is an endangered Ngwi (or Yi) language spoken in Xingmeng, a single farming village in Yunnan, China. Khatso speakers, who number about 5600 people, are descendants of the Mongolian soldiers Kublai Khan brought to Yunnan in the 13th century, and they still identify as Mongolian today. The language has evolved considerably through language contact, however, and is now considered part of the central branch of the Ngwi language family within the Tibeto-Burman phylum. Khatso is a tonal language that is both analytic and isolating. The phonology is similar to that of most Ngwi languages, with the exception of its relatively large eight-tone system. Tone sandhi is triggered by a variety of phonological, syntactic and discourse factors. There is very little morphology in the language, and most of the lexicon consists of monosyllabic and disyllabic monomorphemes. There is a rich classifier system, which also marks number and specific reference. Typical word order is SV/APV, though there is a great deal of flexibility in discourse. Simple noun modifiers follow nouns, but relative clauses precede them. Serial verb constructions are frequent, and may describe one- and two-event situations. There is no verbal inflection; the aspectual system is indicated by grammatical particles. There is also no evidential system, but both the interrogative and emphatic marker inventories include morphemes that convey epistemic information. Almost all of the Khatso are bilingual in Mandarin or the local Yunnan dialect, because that is the only way to communicate with outsiders. Chinese is also the only language used in school and mastering it is necessary to pursue an education or find employment outside the town. Children continue to learn the language, but many parents teach them Chinese first and Khatso second. Moreover, there is no writing system; the language is not supported by print media or technology.

There is also no evidential system, but both the interrogative and emphatic marker inventories include morphemes that convey epistemic information. Almost all of the Khatso are bilingual in Mandarin or the local Yunnan dialect, because that is the only way to communicate with outsiders. Chinese is also the only language used in school and mastering it is necessary to pursue an education or find employment outside the town. Children continue to learn the language, but many parents teach them Chinese first and Khatso second. Moreover, there is no writing system; the language is not supported by print media or technology. As a result, the vitality of the language is eroding rapidly.

Fleeing the burial mound in a grief-stricken state, she looked back one last time and noticed that her child's eyes were glowing so brightly they shone straight through the sand.

What is discovered is that 'good' and 'evil' in the forms of de and karma are understood in Falun Gong to have physical existence and these substances attach to the body in unseen dimensions, but nevertheless cause physical, as well as emotional and psychological, health or illness. Through Falun Gong self-cultivation practice, these physical substances and the body itself are transformed. Practitioners perform their identities as 'cultivators', meeting in groups daily for the physical exercises and weekly for reciting Li's texts and reflecting upon, in a sort of communal confessional, their behavior in their everyday lives in relation to Li's ethical teachings. Fieldwork conducted in these settings allows a glimpse into how practitioners understand their own practice and interpret the events and conditions of their own lives, as well as how they construct and maintain those understandings through social practice.

Religious Studies",Religious Studies,Jose I. Cabezon,"Classical Tibetan Buddhist scriptures proscribe the sale of images of the Buddha, religious texts, and particular ritual implements. Such acts are considered sinful and are believed to carry negative karmic consequences. Prior to the Cultural Revolution, artists and craftsmen were almost always commissioned to create such objects, and they were paid primarily through voluntary offering. This was the socially and religiously accepted means of exchange for such objects. However, following the ""opening-up"" of religion in China, the marketization of China's economy, and the introduction of ethnic tourism to Tibetan areas in the 1980s, Tibetans have begun to sell prefabricated religious objects at fixed, market prices for their personal livelihood in what appears to be a violation of the religious injunctions against their sale. This dissertation aims to understand Tibetans' commodification of Buddhist objects in the contemporary context and focuses on the causes and outcomes of these commercial practices. Drawing upon textual and historical analysis, as well as ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Amdo (Qinghai Province), it argues that we must understand Tibetans' commodification of religious objects not only as a response to the introduction of free market capitalism in China, but also as a Tibetan response to the socioeconomic and political conditions and circumstances resulting from particular policies enacted by the Chinese Communist Party. Furthermore, while Tibetans' commodification of religious objects has led to practical benefits, such practices are also transforming religious traditions, practices, and values in the ""moral economy"" associated with religious objects and contributing to a reinterpretation of Tibetan Buddhist identity. As such, Tibetans' sale of religious objects challenges current and more positivist perspectives on the effects of commodification by revealing that while such practices can have positive results, they come at the price of transforming the traditional worldview.",China,104.195397,35.86166,49

Religious Studies",Religious Studies,Catherine L. Albanese,"This dissertation addresses the question: how can we make sense of secularization in the United States? The approach I adopt here is to consider secularization as the loss of religious leaders' authority to interpret controversial issues and to have a direct impact on local, state, and federal laws, regulations, policies, and procedures. I focus on religious leaders' responses to prostitution in San Francisco, California, during the years 1848-1917. Investigation involved reviewing primary source materials from archival repositories across the country. Some generalizations can be made about San Francisco religious leaders' responses to prostitution in terms of their respective religious traditions or communities. Protestant leaders sought to address causes of prostitution and to reform prostitutes. Catholic leaders attempted to remove prostitutes from public view. Jewish leaders addressed prostitution both in terms of public health and also in answer to fears about illegal international slavery operations. Responses in Chinatown included both innovations on popular religious practices from China that afforded prostitutes a recognized place in temple life, as well as Protestant missions that sought to reform prostitutes in ways that were partially adopted by Chinatown residents themselves. These responses varied in the degree to which they directly sought to change public policy. When direct engagement was attempted, religious leaders were frequently surprised at their inability to have an impact on city and state policies. This development can be seen as an illustration of secularization in San Francisco. Furthermore, I suggest that San Francisco religious leaders' lack of authority regarding prostitution can be explained in terms of local developments in labor and gender roles that occurred in the wake of the California Gold Rush. Similar developments were not evidenced in other parts of the United States until decades later, towards the close of the nineteenth century. This suggests that, at least with regard to issues related to prostitution, San Francisco secularized earlier than other parts of the country. Whether it makes sense to make broader claims about San Francisco's early secularization would require additional investigation into local religious leaders' responses to other controversial issues of the day.",China,104.195397,35.86166,49

Subsistence farmers drawn to the area since the beginning of settlement in the 1960's are the primary residents, many of whom in-migrated to Chitwan for the increased agricultural opportunities available in the valley compared to more rural areas of Nepal. However, the dependence of the population on rainfed and seasonally irrigated agriculture leads to a vulnerability to environmental change. This study begins with an analysis of climate trends in the area, finding increasing interannual precipitation variability, increasing minimum temperatures, and reduced dry season streamflow, all likely to have adverse effects on agricultural yields in the region. Using satellite and social survey data from the Chitwan Valley Family Study, a regression model reveals links between agricultural productivity and short-distance temporary migration in the valley. Finally, to integrate findings from multilevel studies of social and environmental change in the region, an agent-based model is developed, and used to examine the effect of reciprocal connections (feedbacks) between demographic change and land use. The model reveals that feedbacks between environmental change and individual-level demographic decisions can lead to significant differences in rates of population growth and land-use change. The study reveals the strong couplings between environmental change, individual-level decisions, and livelihoods in Chitwan, and suggests that managers must take a holistic, landscape-level view when setting conservation policy.",Chitwan Valley ,84.4524666,27.5341022,1

History of Art and Architecture",History of Art and Architecture,E. Bruce Robertson,"This dissertation investigates the depiction of the ""average American,"" a statistical and visual trope that carried significant ideological weight at the end of the nineteenth century and in the first half of the twentieth century. On a symmetrical bell curve, the most aberrant representative data ground the curve to its horizontal axis, while the average is located at its central peak The center of the bell curve was a late nineteenth- and twentieth-century obsession, especially in the United States, where immigration, economic instability, and swift modernization made it seem ever more urgent to understand the nation's diverse population in ""objective"" terms. This dissertation examines how the average American---as determined by both statistical and anthropological models---was represented in sculpture. I trace the scientific and artistic trajectories of three sets of sculptures, a male and female figure commissioned by Dudley Allen Sargent from Henry Hudson Kitson and Theo Alice Ruggles to represent the average American man and woman at the Chicago's Columbian Exposition in 1893, the Races of Mankind exhibit commissioned by Chicago's Field Museum of Natural History from Malvina Hoffman which opened in 1933, and Norma and Normman, commission by Robert Latou Dickinson from Abram Belskie and which were put on display at the Cleveland Health Museum in 1945. These sculptures were meant to be seen by large audiences in public spaces, and were primarily didactic objects intended to promote physical, racial, and sexual fitness.and contributed to statistical imaginary of the interwar years. I argue that such representations derived their authority from their scientific aura and were an effective way to construct an imagined community blissfully unchallenged by diversity and difference. These sculptures were based explicitly on data compiled by large-scale statistical or anthropological projects. They were all meant to be seen by large audiences in public spaces (world's fairs, natural history museums, health museums) and were primarily didactic objects intended to promote physical, racial, and sexual fitness. Such representations derived their authority from their scientific and their artistic aura and were used as tools to develop a specific kind of public, while simultaneously discouraging the formation of others. They were effective ways by which to formulate and fix an imagined community in which the challenges of diversity and difference could be tamed if not fantasized away entirely.",Cleveland,-81.6943605,41.49932,1

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Ralph Archuleta,"The seismic velocity structure in the southern San Andreas Fault region is characterized by a known, distinct seismic velocity contrast on opposite sides of the fault, with a thick sedimentary region on the west side (Salton Sea area). Reverberations would affect the duration of shaking for El Centro, Mexicali, and other communities in the Coachella Valley and Imperial Valley. Furthermore, there are other areas where deep basins are bounded by faults that could have similar effects. Therefore, being able to determine the 3D structure is a critical facet of assessing the overall seismic hazard for structures on such basins. By utilizing the particle motion of surface waves, we are able extract useful information about the S-wave velocity structure. To accomplish this, we measured Rayleigh-wave ellipticity of continuous broadband data from 2010 to 2014 for 67 stations within the Southern California Seismic Network (SCSN). Measurements of Rayleigh-wave ellipticity were computed as the ratio between the vertical and horizontal amplitudes. Regional variations in the Rayleigh-wave ellipticity measurements at frequencies of 0.10 Hz up to and including 0.30 Hz illuminate small ellipticity values (i.e. horizontal elongation in Rayleigh-wave particle motion) across the entire frequency band in the regions specific to the thick sedimentary region. In this region, minimum ellipticity values (<0.20) observed at 0.10 Hz, 0.15 Hz, and at 0.20 Hz show a gradual increase up to 0.60 between 0.25 Hz to 0.40 Hz. In most areas exterior to the thick sedimentary region, ellipticity values are generally constant across the frequency band and are significantly higher (>0.90). The observed, small ellipticity values, which are characteristic of a slow velocity layer at shallow depths (upper 5-10 km), could have significant implications on the S-wave velocity structure. As the ZH-Ratio method is highly sensitive to the near-surface structure, combination of the ellipticity data with phase velocity data measured via noise cross-correlation could provide further compelling insight in the shallow S-wave velocity structure, particularly in the upper 5 km.",Coachella Valley,-116.3591772,33.7666873,1

My field research showed that these effects vary by site, season, and sampling technique/stratum, and are apparently modulated by the characteristics of both the invader and the invasion itself, including growth patterns, litter production, invader abundance, and native plant diversity. Even a relatively small amount of Carpobrotus edulis has negative effects on arthropod abundance, richness, and composition, with an exponential decrease in abundance and richness and a shift in composition well before 50% Carpobrotus cover. Changes in feeding guilds and composition helped to suggest the drivers of these patterns, and revealed a particularly strong effect on fossorial arthropods, likely related to the dense rooting structure of Carpobrotus. Thus, while the negative effects of non-native plant invasions typically increase with increasing invader cover, the form of this relationship is determined by the attributes of both the invader and the invaded system. For my dissertation work, I asked what effect non-native plant invasions are having on entire arthropod assemblages, and how that effect is related to the degree of invasion. I further asked how the responses by component feeding guilds contribute to these relationships. I answered these questions by conducting a meta-analysis and review of existing studies, then investigating the effects of one invader, Carpobrotus edulis, on coastal dune arthropods at four different coastal California sites. At Vandenberg Air Force Base, Montana de Oro State Park, and San Buenaventura State Beach, I utilized unmanipulated Carpobrotus populations to compare paired invaded and uninvaded patches and to investigate a gradient of Carpobrotus infestation. At Coal Oil Point Reserve, I conducted an experimental restoration trial, removing varying amounts of Carpobrotus and re-vegetating with native dune plants. Invertebrate responses to plant invasions can help delineate the drivers of biodiversity and community patterns, thus guiding the conservation and restoration of diverse native ecosystems. Although it is well known that invasive species have pervasive effects on native communities and ecosystems, our knowledge of the relative contributions of, and interactions among, key factors determining invader impacts is limited. Among potentially key factors is invader abundance, but few studies have examined its relationship to community structure. Those studies have shown varying relationships between invertebrate assemblages and invader cover, illustrating the need for additional studies on the forms and mechanisms of relationships between invertebrate biodiversity and invasive plant abundance.",Coal Oil Point Reserve,-119.877952,34.408074,1

Anthropology",Anthropology,Michael Gurven,"While there is growing evidence of the importance of effective marine conservation programs that address both ecological and social concerns, there is still a dearth of evidence concerning the social mechanisms that can promote or hinder such programs. Some studies have correctly suggested that there is a need to increase attention to the social component of marine protected areas (MPA), yet few have developed a systematic way to analyze and determine particular characteristics that influence an individual's decision whether to accept or reject conservation. To provide a way forward, I present findings from research conducted on the Caribbean islands of Providencia and Santa Catalina, Colombia, where I used a political ecology framework to examine environmental problems and institutions both at a macro and micro level, and social network analysis and regression analysis to determine the rationale on which individuals base their decisions regarding marine conservation programs. In particular, because MPAs most often are located in close proximity to coastal areas where fishing is a way of life, I focus attention on artisanal fishermen's livelihood approach and their social networks to identify critical interpersonal relationships and individual attributes that affect their position vis-a-vis conservation. Findings show that complex environmental policies create distrust within artisanal fishing communities and that trust in government institutions is one of the variables that most affects fishermen's acceptance of resource management programs. Findings also indicate that knowledge of declining marine resources does not necessarily increase fishermen's willingness to conserve. Social conditions, including lack of alternatives and the need to meet day-to-day necessities, often influence an individual's decisions, despite their understanding of possible long-term consequences of their actions. In addition, findings show that while social networks are critical for information sharing, building and maintaining important interpersonal relationships, and in influencing an individual's decision to accept or reject management programs, networks alone do not determine their attitudes or actions; a number of variables working in tandem dictate their behavior and willingness to cooperate. The social, political, and ecological complexities of marine resource management addressed here stress the importance of supporting robust social science research on the effects of conservation programs. This dissertation also emphasizes that both the social and natural sciences can contribute a wealth of knowledge about the interface between the human and natural dimensions of conservation, and that they can collectively produce management strategies that both support healthy ecosystems and sustainable livelihoods. Therefore, I present a comprehensive way to understand local communities and the possible outcomes of MPA designation, and provide a direction for future social science research on marine conservation.",Colombia,-74.297333,4.570868,4

Biomolecular Science and Engineering",Biomolecular Science and Engineering,Kenneth S. Kosik,"Understanding how genetic variation (genotype) contributes to diverse traits (phenotype) is a grand challenge in biology and the overarching theme of this dissertation. Neurological disorders include over 600 diseases and affect the central and peripheral nervous systems. Communication, intelligence, memory, and consciousness -- fundamental abilities that have elevated humankind above the rest of the animal kingdom, are all susceptible to attack from neurological disorders. The contribution of genetic variation to human traits and diseases has been studied for over a century, revealing a strong genetic component to almost every phenotype examined. Establishing genetic associations and delineating their molecular mechanisms in neurological disorders can reveal insight into the establishment, restoration, and enhancement of key human traits. The commencement of my doctoral studies coincided with the emergence of two groundbreaking scientific achievements: whole-genome sequencing and induced pluripotent stem cells. Here, I used these seminal technological advancements in biology as novel approaches to establish phenotype-genotype connections in neurological disorders. Functional genomics aims to integrate high throughput genomic and transcriptomic data to understand the biological function of genetic variation. This dissertation is split into two parts presenting divergent functional genomics approaches to understand two neurological disorders: whole-genome sequencing in Alzheimer's disease and induced pluripotent stem cell modeling of Williams syndrome. In the first part of this thesis, I used whole-genome sequencing data to identify genetic variants modifying age at onset of Alzheimer's disease in the world's largest family affected with this disease. This family, living in Antioquia, the mountainous region surrounding the major Colombian city Medellin, suffers from a rare form of Alzheimer's caused by a single mutation. This mutation, originating spontaneously in a single Spanish Conquistador, crossed the Atlantic and permeated throughout the pueblos indigenas living in Colombia. Over generations of geographic and genetic isolation coupled with exponential population growth, this single mutation spread to thousands of individuals, all who will develop a form of Alzheimer's at an average age of just 49 years. By sequencing the entire genomes of individuals affected with this disease at a range of different ages, we sought to identify genetic variants controlling the onset of this disease. First, we established a pipeline to sift through the wealth of information in a single genome. Next, we examined the genomic locus spanning the causal mutation to show definitively that the mutation originated in a Spanish settler in the early 16th century. Finally, we found a set of genetic variants in a cluster of chemokines that modifies the onset of Alzheimer's in this family and possibly in the general Alzheimer's population as well. In the second part of this thesis, I used induced pluripotent stem cells from individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) to identify disease-relevant pathways, a first step in connecting gene deletions to complex neurological traits. Arising from a hemizygous microdeletion of ~30 genes on chromosome 7, WS offers one of the best platforms to dissect the contributions of specific genes to neurocognitive phenotypes. Among various symptoms of the syndrome including specific craniofacial abnormalities and a characteristic heart valve defect, hyper-social behavior and enhanced language despite intellectual impairment are unique to WS. Converting induced pluripotent stem cells to neurons effectively allows us to study the brains of these individuals and identify which of the deleted genes may contribute to the neurological hallmarks. Integrating high-throughput transcriptional profiling with chromatin-immunoprecipitation of a gene deleted in WS, we identify a critical developmental node dysregulated in WS and the WS-deleted gene contributing to this defect.",Colombia,-74.297333,4.570868,4

History",History,Gabriela Soto Laveaga,"This dissertation analyzes public health programs and the reform narratives doctors and state officials produced from 1930 to 1940, along with residents' petitions sent to Cali's municipal council during the same period. Some of the central questions it strives to answer are: what were Liberal reformers striving to do when they set out to implement social programs in public health and sanitation at this time? How did these programs and the public narratives they produced help alter state-society relations in Colombia? And finally, how did local communities use these programs to negotiate with state officials and gain access to the benefits of full social citizenship? In answering these questions, I argue that Liberal reformers used public health, hygiene, and the organization of space as tools to modernize the nation, redefine the state's responsibility to its citizens, and modify or regulate people's everyday habits, customs, and private lives. Teaching workers and peasants how to create habits that promoted their physical wellbeing and allowed them to contribute to national prosperity through their labor and their productive capacities. Liberal reformers argued that the expansion of public health services and implementation of hygiene campaigns were ideal mechanisms to help the state lead the masses in this transformation. As the Liberal party, in power from 1930 to 1946, set out to implement public health programs designed to modernize the nation, foster economic prosperity, and improve the health of its citizens, government officials and the groups these reform efforts targeted sought to define what citizenship, modernity, health, and progress meant for them. Reform narratives provide just one angle to this story. While reformers portrayed workers and peasants at best as passive victims of more than four decades of state neglect at the hands of Conservative regimes, or at worst as stubborn, backward, ignorant, and unruly subjects---the ways local communities responded to state reform efforts complicates this seemingly simple dichotomy. While reformers promoted a brand of modernity that relied on science, education, and state intervention to diagnose, treat, and cure their society, the petitions local residents sent to their council and other municipal officer show that these actors both adopted and challenged the state's official rhetoric. Municipal records show that communities drew from public narratives and reform language to claim their rights, and gain access to the benefits of inclusion into the social body. While some petitioners used current understandings of hygiene, sanitation, modernity, progress, party loyalty, or citizenship to claim their rights and hold local authorities' accountable for solving their grievances, others proposed alternative definitions of these notions. At a time, when the Liberal party continuously emphasized its commitment to extending state power and responsibility in guaranteeing its citizens access to health, sanitation, education, and other social benefits, petitioners' use of a language that resonated with and challenged these public narratives, shows that negotiation is an essential part of state-society relations, and the limits of reform efforts once they are implemented on-the-ground. In their petitions, local residents turned blame away from themselves, and turned it towards the local state, which they argued was ultimately responsible for failing them. This act showed both the state's inability to extend social guarantees to all its citizens, and contradictions in the state's democratizing efforts.",Colombia,-74.297333,4.570868,4

Economics",Economics,"Kelly Bedard, Peter Kuhn","This dissertation consists of three essays in applied microeconomics that address topics of human and social capital accumulation. The first essay addresses the topic of women and STEM (science, technology, engineering and math.) Women are substantially less likely than men to graduate college with a STEM degree. This paper investigates whether class composition can help explain why women are disproportionately more likely to fall out of the STEM ""pipeline''. Identification comes from a standardized enrollment process at a large public university that randomly assigns freshmen to different mandatory introductory chemistry lectures. Using administrative data, I find that women who are enrolled in a class with higher ability peers are less likely to graduate with a STEM degree, while men's persistence in STEM is unaffected by class composition. I also show that the decline for women is most pronounced for those in the bottom third of the ability distribution. I rule out the possibility that this is driven solely by grades because both men and women receive higher grades in classes with higher ability peers. Overall, these results suggest that class composition as an important factor in determining STEM persistence for women and provide a novel explanation for part of the STEM gender gap in post-secondary education. The second essay, co-authored with Daniel Argyle, examines the effect of the four-day school week in rural Colorado on juvenile crimes. Four-day school weeks are becoming more common nationwide especially in rural areas. Those affected by the policy spend the same number of hours in school each week as students on a typical five-day week, however the four-day week schedule essentially reallocates unstructured time into larger blocks creating a three-day weekend every weekend, since treated students for the most part have Fridays off. Our difference-in-difference estimates for rural Colorado indicate that switching all students in a county from a five-day week to a four-day week increases juvenile arrests for property crimes, in particular larceny, by about 80%. In the third essay, co-authored with Christiana Stoddard, we study the academic achievement of American Indians. The academic achievement of American Indians has not been extensively studied. Using NAEP supplements, we find that the average achievement relative to white students resembles other disadvantaged groups. However, there are several differences. Family characteristics explain two times as much of the raw gap as for blacks. School factors also account for a larger portion of the gap than for blacks or Hispanics. The distribution is also strikingly different: low performing American Indian students have a substantially larger gap than high performing students. Finally, racial self-identification is more strongly related to achievement, especially as American Indian students age.",Colorado,-105.7820674,39.5500507,5

Economics",Economics,Richard Startz,"Understanding social influences is vitally important to understanding human behavior; unfortunately, observing and measuring these effects is extremely difficult. This dissertation focuses on applying and developing techniques to measure social influences on individual decision making. The first chapter develops two techniques for estimating social influences using friendship networks, even when individuals differ on unobservable attributes. The second chapter uses social networks sampled from villages in India to demonstrate strong peer influences on an individual's decision to take a microfinance loan. The final chapter examines changes in juvenile criminal behavior in response to their schools changing to a four-day school week. An abstract for each chapter is provided below. Chapter 2 Abstract: I use friendship networks from villages in rural India to provide a careful examination of peer effects in decisions to take up microfinance. Using social networks resolves the traditional identification problems associated with peer effect estimation and allows each individual to have their own peer group. Since the networks in question are sampled and some friendship information is missing, I use an analytic correction to ensure unbiased estimates as well as a technique known as graphical reconstruction to provide bounds on estimators accounting for possible configurations of the unobserved links in the data. In addition to including a variety of individual covariates, I control for observable characteristics of an individual's peers, examine different ways of specifying network links, and account for the probability of being informed about the program. Across these specifications I find positive and significant peer effects; an additional friend participating in microfinance increases the probability that an individual participates in microfinance by 6%-10%. Chapter 3 Abstract: There has been a recent trend to implement four-day school weeks, especially in rural areas. We show that changing to a four-day school week influences youth criminal activity in jurisdictions where these policies take effect, especially impacting property crime. Focusing on Colorado, where four-day school weeks are especially prevalent, we show that switching all students in a county to a four-day week leads to 0.75 additional juvenile arrests for larceny per 1,000 residents. Effects on other types of crime are inconclusive; estimated signs on drug and violent crimes are negative, although neither attains statistical significance. Chapter 1 Abstract: Existing methods for identifying peer effects in social networks require the assumption that there are no unobserved factors that determine both network links and the outcome of interest. Since this assumption is likely to be violated in most networks, I provide two distinct methods for estimating peer effects in the presence of individual heterogeneity. First, I show that if repeated observations on individuals are available, accounting for time-invariant individual attributes can restore identification. Second, I suggest a semi-parametric Bayesian instrumental variables technique that can be used to estimate peer effects models when panel data is not available or if fixed effects assumptions are undesirable. I demonstrate the properties of both strategies using simulated network data and provide evidence that both are able to estimate peer effects, even when networks exhibit sorting on observable and unobservable attributes. Additionally, I apply both techniques to estimate peer effects in the United States Congress using cosponsorship networks and voting outcomes.",Colorado,-105.7820674,39.5500507,5

Geography",Geography,Naomi L. Tague,"This dissertation explores ecohydrologic interactions in western U.S. catchments using a process-based model. My research focuses on understanding how model estimates of two key components of the hydrologic budget, evapotranspiration and streamflow, are influenced by soil and vegetation physiological characteristics in three watersheds. These watersheds are located in the Oregon Cascades, California Sierra Nevada, and Colorado Rocky Mountains. Water availability in these systems is driven on a first order by annual precipitation. The majority of their precipitation is received in the winter and their forests are generally water-limited in the summer. However, they differ in the magnitude of annual precipitation received, the fraction of winter precipitation received as snow, and their seasonal energy demands. The response of these ecosystems to inter-annual climate variation is also a function of soil storage and ecophysiological characteristics. I will present research motivated by three research questions. How do soil characteristics and climate interact to influence forest water availability? How do uncertainties in forest ecophysiology, carbon allocation strategy, and their interaction effect mature forest carbon and streamflow estimates? Finally, how do climate and carbon allocation strategy influence the rate of forest growth and streamflow recovery following disturbance? I use a physically-based model, the Regional Hydro-Ecologic Simulation System, to address these questions. Results indicate that the influence of soil storage on evapotranspiration's sensitivity to climate drivers varies across sites. In the Sierra Nevada and Cascades, low soil storage increases the sensitivity of annual ET to climate drivers. Evapotranspiration in Colorado, which is water-limited but has a summer monsoonal pulse, is not sensitive to changes in soil storage. Estimates of forest carbon sequestration differ significantly between three carbon allocation strategies in mature (100-300) forests. Biomass estimates for leaf and fine root pools were strongly sensitive to allocation strategy and ecophysiological characteristics in the Sierra Nevada watershed. Streamflow estimates in this drier watershed are also more sensitive to vegetation ecophysiology. I show that the effect of allocation strategy effects estimates of recovery in forest LAI and streamflow more than climate variability at al three sites.

This investigation represents an in-depth study of a space whose history has been recorded only briefly at best and analyzed not at all. From videotaped interviews and events collected over the span of twelve years, news articles, various primary documents and still photographs, and communication with individuals related by family history to Winslow, this study chronicles a civic move to effect a local ""renaissance"" by restoring commercial and civic enterprise at the center of Winslow's once-vital ""main street."" It traces efforts to save Winslow's historic Harvey House, La Posada, from demolition and support its restoration, establish a park and a music festival to attract visitors by memorializing a particularly iconic song, the Eagles' ""Take it Easy,"" and, in conjunction with a national preservation movement begun in the 1990s, revivify interest in Winslow as a stop along the ""Mother Road"" (Route 66). Different groups of citizens faced unique challenges under twenty-first century conditions of economy, location, and social expectation as they set out to return a moribund commercial district to its historical function as remembered by native residents and anticipated by unfamiliar travelers. Set against the nineteenth and early twentieth century background of Winslow's birth and development years the analysis considers the meaning of ""renaissance"" desires at the turn of the twenty-first, based as they were on material ideals of economic revival in a place and at a time when central cities nationwide were experiencing decline. The project combines seven chapters of written history with five short visual documentaries, each of which illustrates the nature of the place and cultural qualities of its residents as they participated in the alteration of their local image. While the historic hotel that people hoped would serve as a catalyst to downtown revitalization was restored beyond almost everyone's expectations, neither commerce nor the architectural landscape that had once accommodated it was revived in Winslow's downtown. The success gap resulted from differences in market appeal: La Posada had a market; downtown Winslow did not.

Mexican and Mexican Americans constituted an integral segment of these mining communities. The unforgiving nature and seclusion of the mountainous environment forced miners and their families to draw on their resources and ingenuity to struggle for their daily needs. This is a study of the relationship between family, community, and worker militancy amongst Mexican and Mexican American men and women through the use of networking and reciprocity. I begin my study by examining the immigration and migration of Mexicans to the Rocky Mountain West in response to work opportunities in the bituminous mines. I argue that work, the collective culture of the mining communities, and class struggle in this geographic region produced a unique working class experience that shaped and reshaped the lives of Mexican and Mexican Americans. I will delineate the growth and consolidation of these early mining communities that in essence were industrial colonies and then examine Mexican and Mexican American's participation in and shaping of the culture, values, institutions, and shared experiences of the mining camps. This is followed by a discussion of the lives of Mexicans in relation to other ethnic mine camp dwellers, all of whom lived in the ""foreign"" section of the camps. The welfare of mine camp households was contingent upon miner's wages. The shared experiences of day-to-day survival drew mine camp residents together into tight community networks. Mine companies dominated politics and society; however, trade unionism and radical politics likewise distinguished the mining camps and enriched community life. Socialists frequently visited the camps, and the Industrial Workers of the World were leading activists who inspired the miner and their families to militancy and added to outbursts of radical activism.

This study is based on a corpus of elicited and naturalistic language recordings made in the home of the Wallas family of Quatsino between 2011 and 2014. The study contributes to the documentation of this little-studied dialect by describing, in Chapter 2, the phoneme inventory and the phonetic character of the segments as well as common phonological processes in this variety of the language. In addition, the phonotactics of the language are documented and investigated with regards to their potential phonetic bases in Chapter 3. The typologically unusual lexical stress system displays a ""default-to-right"" pattern, whereby the leftmost heavy syllable in the word is stressed, but if none are heavy, the rightmost is stressed. The weight distinctions employed by the language shed light on our understanding of sonority and are interesting because while resonants increase a syllable's sonority and weight, glottalization of a coda consonant reduces a syllable's sonority and weight. The investigation of the acoustics of stress and of syllable weight in Guca indicate that glottalization reduces the duration and pitch of vowels followed by glottal coda consonants, and that these parameters correlate with syllable weight in this language. Chapter 4 investigates the current status and use of the lexical suffixes, an important morphophonological and grammatical structure in Guca. Semantically, these derivational suffixes often resemble roots, and they induce phonetic changes on the stems they attach to, which are not part of the regular phonological processes of the language. Because of their structural dissimilarity to grammatical structures in the dominant English language, they are perhaps prone to early loss in the context of language endangerment. However, this study finds that they are still robustly in use by speakers and that they do not show signs of phonological weakening. The language is used primarily as a family code, but is also in use for cultural action and traditions, especially by the youngest speaker.

Music",Music,David C. Paul,"This dissertation explores how music came to be accepted in late-nineteenth-century American university curricula as an element of what historian Laurence Veysey has called the liberal culture reform movement. Proponents of liberal culture focused on advancing the classically derived studies of language, philosophy, literature, and the arts in order to nurture students' sense of refined culture. Using research processes from intellectual history, I place music in the constantly shifting discourse surrounding university arts curricula. I show how proponents for music in higher education borrowed not only rhetoric from the liberal culture reform movement, but from a number of competing reform movements in an effort to legitimize music as an academic subject. I use sociological theories of institutionalism to show how this discourse influenced the architects of prestigious music programs. Furthermore, I examine the importance of women and gender on the establishment of music in American universities. I argue that it was ultimately the collaboration between sympathetic administrators and composers-turned-professors that shaped the foundation of music in the modern American university. To this end, I use three case studies that chronicle the development of music programs at three influential American universities. The first of these is centered on Harvard professor John Knowles Paine, who worked closely with President Charles W. Eliot to build a program that emphasized the role of music in a cultural education within the new elective system. The second case study revolves around composer Horatio Parker. The Yale professor prioritized the study of music composition while establishing a School of Music that offered applied instruction and a number of general education opportunities. The final case study is a culminating moment in the acceptance of music as a university discipline. Composer and Columbia professor Edward MacDowell envisioned music as part of an interdisciplinary department of fine arts that would include literature, sculpture, painting, and architecture. After MacDowell's controversial resignation due to disagreements with President Nicholas Murray Butler, discourse about music in higher education was reinvigorated. This time, however, it figured in a larger debate concerning idealism and materialism in the university and reached beyond the confines of the humanities.",Columbia,-92.3340724,38.9517053,3

Spanish",Spanish,Francisco A. Lomeli,"The critical world has primarily centered on Estela Portillo Trambley's feminist stance. Up to a point, this study can be inserted in this analytical vein. I have studied how Portillo Trambley confronts the patriarchal discourse and her solutions to overcome its grip. But contrary to previous studies, however, I am proposing that her feminist vantage point is a portal for a more integral objective. Although her literary pieces addressed the Chicana's clamor for justice, they also revealed that her tribulations were of global concern. As a starting point, she advocates for Chicano women. But she perceived the feminism of her time as a circumscribed effort that focused on defending the victim and repudiated the victimizer, and at the end, incapable of reconciling them. Portillo Trambley's goal is that the changes produced by feminism benefit all of humanity. She comprehends that progress is vital to her ethnic group, but at the same time, she takes into account her community's relationship to the rest of the world. Simultaneously, we argue that Portillo Trambley positions her work against Catholicism and the Chicano Movement, in particular ""cultural nationalism"". The spirituality manifested in her literary pieces is based on pre-Columbian religious beliefs, primarily the Toltec, Aztec and Mayan cultures. This ideology is enlaced with Carl Gustav Jung's metaphysical concept, the ""Collective Unconscious"", to deconstruct the hegemonic apparatus that dominates the Chicana's life: the Catholic dogma and the macho practices in her culture. Lastly, we propose that her work, rooted in Chicano culture, can be interpreted as cultural and intellectual currents that have an idealist aspiration, namely a brotherhood of humanity. Like a multi-colorful quilt made of diverse treads, Portillo Trambley interweaves various philosophies and discourses in her literary works, among them indigenism, feminism and Hinduism, to create and consolidate her world view. As a result, her literary corpus is a humanist discourse or transcendental chicanismo that transgresses and transforms the physical and imaginary borders that divide humanity, and instead celebrates a mythical union among human beings as the ""cosmic race"".",Columbia,-92.3340724,38.9517053,3

History",History,Gabriela Soto Laveaga,"Conversely, elites conceptualized some forms of outside influence, namely United States aid and foreign-funded improvements to education, as positive. State actors welcomed these influences though they had the potential to foment opposition through the creation of a more educated and politically-sensitized youth. And it was, in fact, educated youth who organized en masse on April 24, 1970 under the banner of a new rights-bearing and responsibility-wielding youth identity, and posed a dramatic challenge to the granting of a mineral exploration concession to the international corporation ALCOA. The way that Costa Rican youth articulated their coalescence around a youth identity before and after the anti-ALCOA demonstrations is one of the most notable aspects of this event. Between 1948 and 1985, the idea of youth as a social category underwent a slow evolution in Costa Rica. From being a relatively meaningless term during the post-civil-war period that often solely denoted a regulation- or statute-based category, ""youth"" became a complex, identity-based signifier by the late nineteen sixties. By looking at Costa Rican state institutions, the Catholic Church, corporate philanthropists, non-governmental institutions, youth demonstrations, women's morality clubs, and the actions and discourse of a wide range of citizen stakeholders, this thesis explores changes to the conceptualization of youth in Costa Rica during this period. Using primary sources including newspaper articles and editorials, agency memoranda from child and youth welfare agencies, political pamphlets, published speeches by government officials, non-governmental organizations' board minutes, letters, and reports, this dissertation traces how youth, often conceptualized as non-citizens in post-war Costa Rica, were primarily the focus of protective efforts and the subjects of political struggles between the State, the Church and other actors. Complicating these struggles in the nineteen fifties and sixties was a rising tide of influences, many of which elites articulated as having originated outside of Costa Rica or as being foreign to Costa Rica, including commercial culture and leisure, Communism, and trans-national youth identities. These influences were publicly rejected as having the potential to negatively affect Costa Rica's youth and, by extension, the well-being of the Costa Rican nation. The specific discourse youth deployed in articulating this new identity demonstrated the opportunities and limitations that had been afforded to youth within the uniquely Costa Rican cultural context. Costa Rica's myth of democratic exceptionalism factored heavily into the way these opportunities and limitations bore out. During and after ALCOA, Costa Rica's youth both appropriated and rejected trans-national revolutionary discourses of the time in an attempt to position themselves squarely within the boundaries of Costa Rica's brand of patriotism, thus legitimizing their efforts in the eyes of some elites, including Catholic luminaries and various politicians.",Costa Rica,-83.753428,9.748917,2

Sociology",Sociology,Kum-Kum Bhavnani,"This ethnographic study examines women's political agency within a woman's cooperative. The everyday practices of organizers are studied to understand the relationship between their experiences of gender inequality, women's vision of themselves as political actors, and the triple shift. Of interest are the contexts and processes that led organizers to create autonomous women's organizations in order to address women's social and economic issues. Contemporary studies examining women in cooperatives in Central and Latin America have primarily focused on the gendered division of labor, women as ""participants,"" and how these organizations impact women's economic and educational development. Few studies examine the processes of transformation for women organizers and what leads women to stay involved in social change. In an attempt to address this literature gap, the Ladies of CoopeCafe, a women's cooperative located in rural Costa Rica, serves as a primary site to re-examine this relationship. As an ethnography of a woman's cooperative, I observed organization activities, interviewed seven leaders, held three group interviews, and collected archival documents. Findings suggest that women's political agency and imagination of gender are transformed through their everyday life experiences in the triple shift. Their political agency is further developed by their experiences of organizing. It is from continued gender inequality and unmet gendered needs that women organizers create new spaces to address women's social and economic issues. Therefore, cooperatives for women organizers serve as sites for transformation of women's political consciousness and for women's continued social and political involvement.",Costa Rica,-83.753428,9.748917,2

It pushes scholars to rethink playfully how temporality has been understood in critical theory by acknowledging the back and forth that always exists between the present moment and utopia. By suggesting that embodied joy in the present is a powerful force in creating a more equitable future, this dissertation rethinks the future-oriented framework of most social justice movements to argue that justice can be reconceived as something joyful, and that the joyful can reconceived as something just. This dissertation engages with salsa, a Spanish Caribbean music and dance tradition of embodied playfulness, to show how joy figures as an integral part of social justice work. It argues that the Cuba, Puerto Rico, and their diasporic communities have generated a particular mode of consciousness that---while often fetishized and dismissed as carefree and erotic island living---actually dismantles hegemonic forms of gender, sexualization, and racialization.

Spanish and Portuguese",Spanish and Portuguese,Ellen McCracken,"To date, no lengthy study has examined queer sexualities and space in Latin American film. In three chapters organized around different spatial scales, I theorize how spatiality reflects and affects the development and expression of queer sexuality in eight films from throughout Latin America. In the first chapter, I explore public and private spaces in relation to queer sexuality in Francisco J. Lombardi's No se lo digas a nadie (Peru 1998), Tomas Gutierrez Alea and Juan Carlos Tabio's Fresa y chocolate (Cuba 1993), and Jorge Fons's El callejon de los milagros (Mexico 1994). I argue that despite their attempts to carve out private spaces---with varying degrees of success---the queer characters in these films are not able to escape the influence of the public sphere and heteronormativity. In Chapter Two, I examine the relationship between queer sexualities and city space. I argue that in Enrique Bochichio's El cuarto de Leo (Uruguay 2009) Montevideo is presented as a sort of utopia, a liberating space for individuals who may choose to come out of the closet. By conflating homosexuality with criminality, Marcelo Pineyro's Plata quemada (Argentina 2000), on the other hand, depicts the traditionally oppressive, unsustainable relationship between the city and homosexuals. In Chapter Three, I explore the use of the body as a space for working through issues of queer sexuality. In the films that I analyze, there is an increasing degree of materialization of the body as space. In Javier Fuentes-Leon's Contracorriente (Peru 2009), the ghost of the protagonist's dead lover serves as a sort of mirror that helps the protagonist cope with his sexuality. In Karim Ainouz's Madame Sata (Brazil 2002), issues of sexual identity, gender, race, and class are consolidated in the body of a cross-dressing performer. In Lucia Puenzo's XXY (Argentina 2007), the concern for the body as space is materialized to the greatest extent. The protagonist is an intersexed adolescent whose body serves as a space that represents not only her internal struggles, but also those of her parents and the society within which she does not neatly fit.",Cuba,-77.781167,21.521757,9

Known as the ""Globe to Globe"" series, this set of productions received ambivalent and sometimes condescending reviews from British critics who did not understand the translation languages or performance conventions. Taking these reviews to encapsulate the productions' reception, scholars have agreed that the series reinforced hegemonic hierarchies between spectators and performers. They argue that the displacement to London rendered the performances' original meanings unintelligible; further, that this dislocation stimulated national superiority in British spectators who measured the performances against their expectations of Shakespeare and their tourist-like desires to witness an exotic Other. However, this perspective obscures both the agency of the performers as participants in the encounter and the diversity of audience response, presenting a fatalistic view of touring performance.

Reading professional reviews against the grain and placing them in conversation with video records and other documentation of the mass audiences' reactions, I suggest that the productions subverted the tourist gaze by resisting easy comprehension. As translation and 'foreign' performance conventions reshaped famous texts, the productions undermined audiences' expectations of both Shakespeare and the culture onstage. Confronted with the limits of their knowledge, spectators improvised new strategies of viewing, learning habits of listening and questioning that challenged cultural hierarchies. These events further undermined dominant power dynamics by attracting audiences from London's diasporic communities and privileging their knowledge and reactions over those of the normative British spectator. This trend intensified in 2012, when the Globe to Globe concept was revived as a massive festival for audiences containing many translation-language speakers.

Economics",Economics,Zachary J. Grossman,"The third chapter advances a simple beta--delta model of quasi-hyperbolic time preferences. In this chapter, the theoretical model is used to construct the key variables from our data. This data was collected in the field by my co-author, when she visited the islands of Bonaire and Curacao in 2010. While much of the data is survey response or demographic related, the last part of each interview includes a paid experiment to elicit time preferences over various time horizons. We find that, controlling for key demographic factors, decreased patience (lower delta) and present bias (beta < 1) are associated with an lower willingness to adopt marine reserve restrictions, but they have no effect on attitudes about gear restrictions. This dissertation concerns two key topics in behavioral economics: bounded rationality and hyperbolic time preferences. While these two topics do not have much in common, per se, the analyses presented here do contain unifying themes. Each chapter focuses on issues pertaining to public economics. The environments are often characterized by strategic interaction, in that each individual's choices affects the welfare of others. In such cases, economic efficiency is by no means guaranteed. The first two chapters examine environments with multiple Nash equilibria, which limits predictions. I utilize Quantal Response Equilibrium, which relaxes the assumption of pure best-response in favor of noisy best response. This allows me to make comparative static predictions across group-size, information completeness, payoff-type, and state of the world; predictions that are problematic under pure best-response. I conduct laboratory experiments for the threshold game (chapter one) and the market entry game (chapter two). I find that much of the seemingly anomalous behavior observed in the data is easily explained using QRE. This suggests that quantal response is a useful alternative assumption to best-response in coordination problems, and, in particular, logit QRE is a valuable equilibrium model of coordination failure with simple economic intuition.",Curacao,-68.99002,12.16957,1

Drawing from cultural representations and interviews I conducted with fifty-one women in rural South Dakota and Minnesota, I suggest that an estrangement exists between the desires, logics, and strategies of LGBTQ women in the rural Midwest and those of gay rights movements. This estrangement points to the need to consider the ideologies undergirding and the ramifications of LGBTQ visibility politics. I make three interventions in the interdisciplinary study of visibility: I argue that calls for visibility are symptomatic of and enable metronormativity, that visibility politics reproduce both post-racial and what I term post-spatial ideologies, and, finally, that becoming recognizable as visible is a labored process, and, as such, calls for LGBTQ visibility, which relentlessly demand constant laboring, are a reflection of and benefit to capitalist logics. In doing so, I revise assumptions about the ostensible relations among gay community, identity, and visibility, question the notion that visibility leads to rights or justice, and challenge dominant conceptions of the nature of rural communities. Beyond examining the unbecoming-ness of visibility discourses, I suggest that an interrogation of visibility discourses explicates how one becomes (and might un-become) a sexual subject and can broaden possibilities for actualizing alternate subjectivities--sexual or otherwise.",Dakota,-93.275307,44.973659,1

Drawing upon qualitative interviews, discourse analysis, archival research, and site studies, my research reveals that in order to survive, physically and professionally, war reporters must increasingly play a variety of roles: they must replace whole news bureaus that have been closed, they must blur the boundaries between above- and below-the-line labor, they must successfully wield digital technologies in competition with amateur bloggers whom they also exploit, and they must serve as a site of cultural value for the news networks even after they have been kidnapped, injured, raped, or killed. The present moment is defined by the visibility of war, exploding at sites that are increasingly monitored by both military and commercial entities. At a time when the Pentagon has restricted the agency of news organizations in warzones, and when amateur and quasi-professional bloggers in various geopolitical regions are destabilizing the primacy of mainstream news networks, scholars from both the humanities and the social sciences are closely evaluating the interconnections between war and media. Though media scholars such as Barbie Zelizer, Daya Thussu, and Toby Miller have crucially discussed the international television and online news coverage of the US-led War on Terror, I look closely at the nuanced cultural meaning of the conflict correspondents themselves, the increasingly beleaguered news employees who occupy the paradoxical position of both framer and framed, digital media producer and commodified cultural sign.",Day,-97.7023716,45.4167482,1

Anti-state rebel militia groups, predominantly located in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the Central African Republic (CAR), regularly challenge the state's supposed monopoly of violence and engage in immense human rights abuses against civilian populations. Various efforts to address these atrocities have included global governance responses such as International Criminal Court indictments, United Nations peace accords, African Union treaties, bilateral peace talks, and the involvement of international and local civil society. Additionally, efforts to abate conflict comprise of various forms of intervention including military, economic, legal, and relief intervention. Also, upholding international law, including both human rights law and international humanitarian law, and the introduction of post-conflict management have worked to address militia groups in numerous ways with wide-ranging results. Issues involving sovereignty, weak states, international intervention, and neo-colonialism are all brought to the forefront when looking at rebel militia violence in this region. The questions then that this study seeks to answer are: What are some non-conventional issues present in conflict that must be addressed in order to realize long-term sustainable peace? What role does transitional justice, both at the local and international level, play in conflict resolution and peacebuilding? How can international actors work with local forces to respond in an effectively coordinated way to sexual and gender based violence, war crimes, and forced displacement?",Democratic Republic of the Congo,21.758664,-4.038333,1

Computer Science",Computer Science,Martin Raubal,"Places and place types, such as small town, play a fundamental role in how people organize knowledge about the world. Although places are commonly referenced in human communication, often they are not canonically defined and many of the properties people associate with them have proved difficult to operationalize. In information systems the representation of place knowledge has predominantly focused on either social science metrics or spatial properties such as location and spatial footprint. However, on the web there exist rich datasets containing unstructured natural language texts that are spatially referenced and which provide us with a window to the salient properties of places as people write about them. This research investigates the operationalization of thematic place properties from collections of place descriptions and methods for reasoning with this knowledge in concert with other place information. This work is organized into three main aspects: place knowledge discovery, place reasoning, and the application of the previous two for geographic knowledge exploration. First, a procedure for extracting thematic place knowledge is presented using a novel combination of topic modeling and spatial statistics. The latent topical contents of documents are interpreted as observations at locations or regions and mapped into properties of places. This procedure is evaluated in terms of its utility for estimating the locations associated with non georeferenced texts. Second, a system is developed to automate reasoning about similar and analogous places, and to find real-world analogs to novel compositions of properties and places, such as ""Denver with beaches."" To systematize this reasoning, a novel observation-to-generalization place model that subsumes the digital gazetteer model is defined. This model differentiates between spatial observations of phenomena and place-based generalizations derived from these observations. It forms the basis for a suite of reasoning operations to find place analogs based on sets of invariant properties. In the third part, the engineering and architecture of Frankenplace, an online geographic knowledge exploration tool that utilizes these discovery and reasoning frameworks, is detailed. This application enables a user to explore the topics relevant to a place, find relevant regions based on a thematic keyword query, and search for analogous places.",Denver,-104.990251,39.7392358,1

Sociology",Sociology,Fernando Lopez-Alves,"The local food movement offers the simple premise that changing the way we eat can change the world. As the global adoption of neoliberal practices has encouraged the ""privatization of survival,"" where states deregulate, sell, and commodify social services once provided for free or at low cost, people without monetary means to access them have gone into debt or gone without. This reduction in public services, rising unemployment rates, soaring fuel and food costs, and a ""race to the bottom in food"" production that makes food less nutritious and less safe, have made more people unable to provide for basic needs and consume healthy food. Additionally, as neoliberal policies have triggered extreme economic inequality, acute difficulties meeting basic needs, and the erosion of political representation, people have responded by rejecting globalization outright or attempting to guide it down a more sustainable path. To better understand the nature of such responses to globalization, where the local food movement fits in, and how urban agriculture efforts in Detroit, Flint, and Ypsilanti are unique, this project documents how the local food movement seeks to relocalize the economy and adopt more sustainable consumption practices to counter the economic inequality, resource scarcity, and social fragmentation exacerbated by neoliberal policies and practices. This project is an ethnographic study of the local food movement in southeastern Michigan and California conducted through urban agriculture experiments and participant observation of farmers markets, urban farms, farmers' cooperatives, community and school gardens, restaurants, non-profits, and local food distribution networks. It also included an online survey investigating motives to support and participate in the local food movement, a comparison between the physical environment, food system, and social environment in Michigan and California, and informal interviews with growers, producers, eaters, chefs, and business owners. It found that although California agriculture is dominant in crop diversity, growing season, and production volume, Michigan has advantages in water and land access, food safety legislation, and zoning ordinances that enable urban agriculture initiatives to be more successful.",Detroit,-83.0457538,42.331427,1

One of these regions is the Caribbean, among the first outside of Europe to be integrated into world capitalism through colonialism five centuries ago. In recent decades, as the Caribbean's population has become entwined with global networks of production and finance in extremely unequal ways, scholars have begun to document shifting social patterns. While Caribbean societies throughout their history have exhibited many differences and continuities, the sweeping changes characteristic of globalization compel us to examine the region's changing political economy. With much of the Caribbean's population based in the Greater Antilles island chain (containing Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico), this geographic area will be referred to most often in my research. As many studies have been done on contemporary Puerto Rico (as an associated part of the U.S.) and on socialist Cuba, the case studies of this dissertation will focus on Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. In looking at these three countries, case studies will examine how their national economies have fragmented and become penetrated by global chains of accumulation.

This project offers a mixed methods approach for the examination of race that first constructs meaning for each term (in lieu of translation), and then empirically tests hypotheses regarding physical and social information via photo description questionnaires. As the dissertation explores the rich information contained in the language of race, it argues that the contemporary Dominican concept of race may be subdivided into several distinct paradigms that researchers cannot take for granted; that informed analyses must account for regional differences within the Dominican Republic; that fluidity in the categorical boundaries of descriptive terms should not be mistaken for confusion; and that the physical boundaries of dominicanidad may be surprising. With language as the lens, this project offers new methodologies for investigating race and proposes new frames for interpreting the results that significantly contribute to ongoing conversations on race in the Dominican Republic, Latin America, and the Western hemisphere. The U.S. academy has a complicated relationship with the Dominican racial setting. Although scholars from diverse disciplines have examined race in the Dominican Republic for decades, the prevailing frame for analysis has been rooted in perceptions of exceptional negrophobia, xenophobia, and confusion, and essential denial of ""true"" racial identity. Even as new studies position race in the Dominican Republic in a more complex social and historical context, narratives of Dominican exceptionalism and essentialism persist in academic and popular discourse. The narratives criticize Dominican reticence to identify as negro and audacity to claim to be indio. Some have argued that the country is mulato, certainly not blanco, and only marginally mestizo. Despite the centrality of racial terms to this conversation, few studies have analyzed these terms as a critical intersection of language and race in the Dominican Republic.

Spanish and Portuguese",Spanish and Portuguese,Sara Poot-Herrera,"The fundamental importance of the examination of these African nuns' lives lies not only in the revelation of the discourse strategies their writers used to avoid, emphasize or modify the color of the nuns' skin, but also in the analysis of the unusual phenomenon represented by the characters who surrounded the nuns, permitting Sister Juana Esperanza and Sister Teresa Juliana entry to cloistered institutions and, thereby, aiding them to become the subject of documentation in spite of their race. The basic bibliography for this investigation are the texts of Jose Gomez de la Parra and Juan Carlos Pan y Agua, written during the 18 th century and relating to significant events in the religious orders to which they belonged. The chronicle of the Carmelite convent Fundacion, y primero siglo del muy religioso convento del senor San Jose de religiosas carmelitas descalzas, in which is found the ""life"" of Sister Juana Esperanza de San Alberto, was written by Jose Gomez de la Parra in 1732 in honor of the centennial of the establishment of the Carmelite order in Puebla. Juan Carlos Pan y Agua wrote the Compendio de la vida ejemplar de Sor Teresa Juliana de Santo Domingo in 1752, basing the exemplary life on the funeral sermon he had delivered for the Dominican nun. Contemplating a model of female religiosity in the realms of Spain and New Spain in the late 17th to early 18th centuries could return us to an archetypical Marianite representation, whose image of purity and perfection is traditionally white, possibly brown, but rarely black. What happens when this construction of sanctity is based on something extraordinary and inserted in its deep-rooted orthodoxy? What happens when the destiny of two marginalized women, in this case two African slaves who took religious orders on either side of the Atlantic, becomes the object of exemplary religious discourse? This investigation presents the exemplary lives (vidas ejemplares) of Sister Juana Esperanza de San Alberto and Sister Teresa Juliana de Santo Domingo that, in spite of their appearance and condition, ceased to be slaves and became instead models of virtue. In addition to containing the vidas ejemplares of these African nuns, the richness of the texts themselves as well as the circumstances in which they were produced, give these writings an importance of their own. Compilations of the vidas ejemplares and the confessional autobiographies of the Carmelite nuns of Puebla are found in the chronicle of Gomez de la Parra. Pan y Aguas' compendium, based on the funeral speech of Teresa Juliana and written by the same author, contains discourse conventions which raise it above its genre and approach that of hagiography.",Dominica,-61.370976,15.414999,3

The term ""temporariness"" is used to conceptualize the structures of feeling that emerge alongside the growing phenomena of provisional labor and transitory migration that correspond with the increase of globalization and neoliberalism of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. These rapidly growing cities are icons of the opportunity and development offered by the promises of globalization and neoliberal economic policies, which have ushered in increased free trade, deregulation, and privatization since the 1980s. The dissertation argues that the opportunities and promises of prosperity are not equally available to all, and we can, instead, observe the rise of temporariness as a sign of these inequalities. The temporariness of life for workers in neoliberal networks of trade and governance can benefit some, while disenfranchising others, and the distribution of benefit is often divided along hemispheric, national, racial, and gendered lines.

Global and International Studies",Global and International Studies,Richard Appelbaum,"As billions of dollars are being invested in construction, construction workers are the physical driving force behind the UAE's infrastructural development and overall growth. Despite being an integral component to decreasing the dependence on oil rents and diversifying the economy through construction, workers in this industry are severely mistreated. This study seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of workers' rights in the construction industry in the UAE. The central research question framing this study is: what are the labor violations faced by workers and to what degree has the UAE government responded to these issues? The follow up questions are then, have working conditions improved and what are the challenges in improving these conditions? This study employs a qualitative approach, drawing on current literature in order to answer the central research questions. The discussion in this paper is based on an analysis of the information collected through archival research and is divided into 7 chapters. The penultimate chapter of this thesis features a case study of Abu Dhabi's $27 billion megaproject, Saayidat Island, which is home to the new Guggenheim, Louvre, and New York University (NYU) satellite campus. This current case study will be used in order to examine the status of workers' rights violations and the level of enforcement of government policy on labor issues. After a review of government policy on labor, this paper concludes that the UAE does not lack legislation on labor issues, but rather lacks enforcement of these laws. Thus, this study finds that the largest hurdles to enforcing labor laws is the level of crony capitalism between the government and the construction industry and the disposability of labor. This study hypothesizes that the partnerships Abu Dhabi is building with big international names at Saayidat Island, like the Guggenheim and Louvre museums and also universities like New York University, may serve as a tipping point and bring more international scrutiny to violations of workers' rights in this industry. The hope is that mounting international pressure, as seen in Qatar leading up to the 2022 World Cup, will encourage the UAE to go beyond responding to these issues at the institutional level and motivate them to enforce the labor laws on the ground. In the 1960s the United Arab Emirates (UAE) struck oil. Over the years, the UAE has increasingly invested in an array of sectors to reduce economic dependence on hydrocarbon exports. All sectors that the UAE is actively investing in, are not only global but require infrastructure development. Between the Emirates of Dubai and Abu Dhabi there are currently about 1,300 construction projects in development worth over $418 billion (Sonmez et al., 2011). The Emirates lack the domestic labor force required to support these construction endeavors. For this reason, the UAE is largely dependent on migrant labor.",Dubai,55.2707828,25.2048493,2

In 1996, Musgrave was commissioned by the 17 th Dumfries & Galloway Arts Festival & and 1st Burns International Festival to create a composition using some of the poetry by Robert Burns, a well-known Scottish poet. It is undisputable that Musgrave's music is linked to Burns. Her ability to reflect historically to echo Burns's time while fastening in her own contemporary compositional style make ""Songs for a Winter's Evening"" an excellent case study for today's modern voice major. The careful and detailed analysis performed in this document will help singers prepare for performing this cycle, but will largely impact a performer in a more significant way. This analysis should demonstrate the steps with which a performer should take in creating a thorough examination of a medium-large scale vocal composition. Performers can draw from the step-by-step process provided in this document, and upon reading the analysis of ""Songs for a Winter's Evening,"" the singer may use this knowledge and apply it to other works performed in the future. The challenge of this work is that it is necessary to know Burns's tunes before understanding Musgrave's composition and the history behind its genesis, especially since Musgrave incorporates the original music in both the vocal line and accompaniment throughout. I will document the material a performer can use as a supporting source in preparing for a performance of this song cycle. First, I will briefly discuss the history of the song cycle, followed by background on Thea Musgrave as a person, musician, and composer with details on her song cycle. Next I will give a short description of Robert Burns, his history and poetry, and will complete the introduction of this paper with a detailed description of the process I applied while analyzing Musgrave's cycle.

The purpose of this study is to explore the various strategies and tactics that helped to shape particular agreement details, in order to provide more insight to our understanding of the dynamics of international economic negotiations. Since the conventional three levels of analysis of International Relations cannot tell which specific outcome may be selected, a problem of multiple equilibria results. I contend that negotiators' bargaining strategies and tactics can solve a multiple equilibria problem as they help explain the specific details of outcomes. This research uses the recent agreement to multilateralize the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMIM), with particular emphasis on the issues of members' financial contributions and vote shares, to analyze negotiation processes. Due to data inaccessibility problems and financial constraints, I chose to focus on five of the most influential players in the CMIM negotiations---Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. It should be noted that China, though it was an important actor in the CMIM negotiations, is not included in my analysis due to a lack of direct access to Chinese sources. Extensive archival research and in-depth interviews were employed to collect data. Process tracing was a method of analysis. My investigation of the CMIM negotiations reveals that the member states employed several bargaining elements to alter final outcome. States with a lower discount rate (a lower sense of urgency) and a more attractive best alternative to no agreement (batna) were able to walk away with more favorable terms than those with a higher discount rate and less attractive batna. Also, possessing knowledge about other actors' preferences or about issues being discussed (expertise) enhanced states' relative bargaining leverage. Countries took advantage of being a co-chair of the negotiation to turn the agreement terms in their favor. In some circumstances, countries strategically linked issues under negotiation to reap concessions from the others. Additionally, forming a coalition or preventing a coalition of other states from forming sometimes helped states achieve their objectives.",East China,-92.3576436,42.4708235,1

Specifically, this work explores such subjects as the nature of Soviet foreign policy under Stalin, origins of the Grand Alliance between the USSR with the western powers as well as the Soviet Union's role in the context of the global struggle of World War II. This dissertation examines these themes from a perspective of international history. Extensive use of primary sources gathered from archives in Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States allows providing new, more nuanced evaluations of subjects under analysis. Specifically, this work concludes that Soviet foreign policy under Stalin operated on the basis of power politics, with considerations of the balance of power and security being paramount for Soviet policymakers. Soviet diplomats during the Second World War more often resembled practitioners of Realpolitik than revolutionary ideologues. Their practical analysis of international relations, however, was conditioned by an ideological Leninist model that often skewed their interpretation of political developments. Additionally, this study finds that the Soviet Union played an important role in the global conduct of the war. Not only was it heavily involved in the war in Europe, but it was also a significant factor in the struggle between the Allies and the Axis in the Far East. This does not mean, however that the Soviet Union was a fully-fledged member of the Grand Alliance from the beginning of its participation in the war. This dissertation argues that the Soviets and the western powers formed a tenuous association until 1943, fighting largely separate wars and being preoccupied with divergent political interests. By the end of 1943, however, the Soviet Union became a full partner in the wartime coalition, participating in formulation of common military strategy and plans for establishment of a new world order on equal footing with Great Britain and the United States.",East Germany,10.451526,51.165691,2

History",History,Harold Marcuse,"Following the fall of the East German government, the activists who helped to precipitate the regime's collapse fought to ensure that the secret police agency, the Ministry for State Security, or Stasi, would be dismantled. I examine the motivations and actions taken by the East German citizens' organizations to make this happen. I argue that without the driving force of the citizens' movements, the Stasi would likely have continued to operate and destroy evidence of its work. I trace the development of the citizens' movements and show how their actions drove the dissolution of the Stasi. I examine the role that certain activists played in forcing the transitional East German and unified German governments to create a law governing the Stasi's files. Without pressure from activists, the law would not have passed. In pushing to preserve the Stasi's files the East German activists continuously inserted themselves into a governmental process. In demonstrating the role of the citizens' movements in the process of building democracy, I emphasize the importance of a multifaceted reckoning with the past that includes the voices of both the government and the people.",East Germany,10.451526,51.165691,2

Sociology",Sociology,"Richard Flacks, G. Reginald Daniel","This dissertation examines La Contra Cultura (the Counter Culture), a musical movement centered in East Los Angeles which utilizes art as a cultural weapon. I use a theoretical framework that incorporates inequalities, social movements, and sociology of culture/popular culture, to do grounded, qualitative, analytic work focusing on oppositional consciousness, decolonization, and identity and community-building within the area of ethno-cultural music, art, and performance. Stemming from my fieldwork, I describe in detail the Contra Cultura, a mix of musicians, artists, vendors, organizers, and urban sacred sites, which examine native and indigenous history, challenge 500 years of colonization, and promotes an urban indigenous identity to challenge systems of racial oppression and white privilege. I then analyze the lyrics of over 400 songs to construct a decolonial pedagogy. The messages contained within the song lyrics address the legacies of colonization by building indigenous history, expressing a self conscious challenge to Eurocentric domination, and promotes the reclaiming of indigenous cultural thought to construct an urban indigenous identity. The dissertation then uses ethnographic data to understand live performance as ceremonies of resistance. At these urban ceremonies, musical performance is geared at creating autonomous communities by allowing participants to think critically about their lives while creating community history through a shared relationship to oppression. The concepts of Decolonial Imagination and Wombyn Warriors are then developed. Using case studies and in depth interviews, I explore the decolonial imagination through the work of Aztlan Underground and Olmeca. These two artists combine critical pedagogy and the Sociological Imagination to help their audiences understand their subjective realities within the objective conditions of capitalism and neo colonialism. The concept of the wombyn warrior is constructed by looking at the work of In Lak Ech, Cihuatl Ce, and the Guerrilla Queenz. These femc's use music as a tool to construct new visions of femininity, challenge colonized views of traditional womanhood, and promote cultural affirmation through the birthing of art, poetry, music, and teatro.",East Los Angeles,-118.1669736,34.0224417,2

The East Los Angeles Backyard Punk Scene and the Creations of Social Spaces at the Turn of the 21st Century,2012,"Gomez, Jonathan Daniel","University of California, Santa Barbara. Sociology",Sociology,George Lipsitz,"In this thesis I document, describe and analyze the reconfigurations of space in East Los Angeles with punk rock cultures, particularly the backyard punk scene from 1998-2008. In the processes of reconfiguration privately oriented and policed places are transformed into public oriented punk rock social spaces. With a focus on punk rock culture that includes music, gig organization and travel to gigs I look into the creation of multiple forms of social space where aggrieved persons can construct uplifting identities and form new subjectivities and solidarities with others. Through an ethnographic methodology I reveal how the social spatial and cultural production of gigs creates new discursive and physical sites of congregation and mutual aid. Interviews with participants of the backyard scene reveal that by attending to their needs, desires and imaginations they actively take part in a continuing practice of social protest in East Los Angeles. Accompanying the Skums on their travels to and from backyard gigs I reveal that in East Los Angeles punk rock is not only about music, but also about constructing methods of reaching and returning from backyard gigs. The spatial relations I witnessed reveal that Chicanas/os and Latinas/os face unfair consequences like other impoverished classes whose presence in the public sphere brings with it suspicion and criminalization. The stakes of the unpaid labors that make up punk rock in East Los Angeles are complex. East Los Angeles cultural actors work diligently to materialize a range of desires that in effect offset the lack of city and state funded public spaces in their neighborhoods and make segregation into congregation with use value orientations to space and cultures of punk rock.",East Los Angeles,-118.1669736,34.0224417,2

Economics",Economics,Gary B. Charness,"Little is known about how heterogeneity in users with varying stakes in a resource impacts withdrawal behavior. To address this gap in knowledge, chapter two presents a CPR game incorporating heterogeneous agents as individuals facing different penalties when a threshold is crossed. The experiment was structured to determine how different types of individuals respond to varying levels of information and enforcement. Results determined how this heterogeneity impacts withdrawal behavior and specify whether it requires us to modify previous policy recommendations for the management of a threshold CPR given heterogeneous withdrawal behavior. I determined that the absence of coherent approaches to natural resource use resulted in a sub-optimal economic outcome, lower earnings and a shorter CPR lifespan. I found that punishment can be an effective tool in reducing resource use and increasing common-pool longevity, but has the opposite effect when announced targets or policies are unenforced. In chapter three, I address the ""Challenges to Measuring, Monitoring, and Addressing the Cumulative Impacts of Artisanal and Small-Scale Gold Mining (ASGM) in Ecuador."" Mercury and other waste from ASGM in the environment create many environmental health and economics costs, the future impacts of which are not fully known. These are discussed in the context of ongoing, unresolved issues including efforts to address trans-boundary water pollution, management of mining waste, and conflicts regarding enforcement of existing regulations and policies. There is often discrepancy over how best to calculate future costs, largely over how to weight the present costs versus the future costs (the discount rate). Due to the nature of the fragmented and difficult to regulate ASGM market, I advocated for information-based strategies including educating miners regarding the risks they face and helping to identify and avoid inefficient processing plants. This dissertation consists of three separate papers in experimental and environmental economics, each demonstrating the benefits of effective communication and the detrimental effect of present-biased preferences on the environment. As a result of policy makers' bias for the present, they may struggle to resolve their conflict between current resource consumption and resource conservation. This is often exhibited through inconsistent and constantly changing environmental and natural resource management policies. In chapter one, I discuss the results of my laboratory experiment which was developed to determine the impact of information uncertainty and lack of policy enforcement on the lifespan of threshold Common-Pool Resources (CPRs). I found that providing individuals with reliable information and allowing individuals to develop beliefs results in both economic growth and preservation of the Common-Pool Resource (CPR). Based on these experimental results and in combination with real-world policy observations, I recommend not revealing a true threshold for a CPR. Since policy makers are faced with a bias for the present and their policies are likely to change, a firm policy today is likely to become one that will be readjusted tomorrow. In the best case of announcing a policy target, there was no gain over letting an individual develop their own beliefs. In the worst case, individuals faced a significant loss of earnings and a shorter CPR lifespan. The findings of this study have implications for many CPR and environmental management policies around the globe, as well as other areas of government regulation where we see changing targets.",Ecuador,-78.183406,-1.831239,6

Global and International Studies",Global and International Studies,Aashish Mehta,"Ecuadorian member organizations of the transnational social movement La Via Campesina won legal recognition of the state's responsibility to guarantee one of their central demands, food sovereignty, or the people's right to determine their agri-food systems and the extent to which this right can be exercised, in that country's 2008 constitution and 2009 food sovereignty law. These victories came after decades of uprisings by rural and indigenous social movements resulted in the election in 2006 of Ecuador's populist president, Rafael Correa, who denounced neoliberalism and made the alternative development paradigm of buen vivir (or ""living well,"" from the Kichwa sumak kawsay) a central part of his Citizen's Revolution. Academic literature in the wake of these developments has focused on the ideas of plurinationality and ecologically sustainable development embodied in the concept of buen vivir (Davalos 2009, Escobar 2010, Cobey 2012, Oviedo 2014), analysis of state-social movement interaction in institutionalizing the food sovereignty policy regime (Pena 2013), and participation in this process by urban consumer movements (Van Ongeval 2012). Nevertheless, research into the praxis of food sovereignty and buen vivir by rural communities themselves remains limited. In order to address the dearth in academic literature on these topics and investigate the gap between food sovereignty in principle and in practice, this project takes an action research approach to investigate practices of food sovereignty in three communities of the Sierra region of Ecuador. Specifically, the questions of 1) how practices of food sovereignty mesh with or contradict state policy and social movement rhetoric, 2) how such practices inform the notion of buen vivir as an alternative development strategy, and 3) the extent to which an action researcher can contribute to the food sovereignty of the communities being studied are addressed. These are addressed via the researcher's participant observation at the invitation of each community as a participant on a multicultural exchange program sponsored by the Quito-based NGO Huayra Causay, for whom the researcher interned for a period of six months. The study finds positive outcomes such as mobilization for grassroots land reform, collaboration with multinational NGOs for targeted investment in irrigation infrastructure and the creation of community governance for its oversight, and partnership with municipal governments to promote rural producer's associations with direct marketing opportunities such as farmer's markets. However, significant obstacles still remain, such as contradictory policy, high rate of return conditionality for state investment, and intransigence of the national assembly in the participatory legislative process for food sovereignty, making the notion of buen vivir a still-distant ideal for the communities studied.",Ecuador,-78.183406,-1.831239,6

Sociology",Sociology,"Kum-Kum Bhavnani, John Foran","Shifts in national political and cultural identity were fueled by popular projects of interculturalism whereby linguistic, ethnic, and ideological differences were encouraged and openly observed. As of 2007, the Ecuadorian constitution officially acknowledges the concept of mother earth as a living being. It also recognizes Pachamama worldview concepts such as sumak kawsay, or well-being, as underpinnings of a sustaining way of life. Better chances at self-determination and communal development became available during these social shifts in Ecuador. As migration to Quito and other large cities continued in this century, ayllu networks grew dramatically in predominantly mashi districts like San Roque, just south of Old Town Quito. Political mobilization by Ecuadorian mashikuna or indigenous pueblos and nations culminated nationwide in the 1990 uprising whereby the Ecuadorian president was overthrown. This political maneuver was orchestrated by coalitions of different sectors of Ecuadorian society. Mashikuna national networks mobilized effectively to block transportation and commerce, backed by mestizo elite and working sectors, and military leadership, with the help of rank and file. Rising national discontent with neoliberal policy implementation in the late 1980's fueled alliances against corrupted political leadership. To understand the everyday practice of Pachamama worldview is essential to understand Ecuadorian indigenous identity and political mobilization in the 21st century. Sumak kawsay provides political, spiritual and economic support for ayllus that are have no government support. The importance of sumak kawsay in the life of mashikuna explains their unwavering resistance against neoliberal projects of individualism and the destruction of the environment for profit. Despite migration to urban centers, outside cultural and technological influence, religious shifts, and continuing racism, mashi continue to live in solidarity with one another, according to the Pachamama worldview. The San Roque network in Quito is an example of how Ecuadorian urban ayllu networks acculturate while maintaining a core identity that entails complex political and economic ties. San Roque provides mashi ayllu networks a degree of autonomy to develop influential political, economic, and spiritual coalitions according to their sumak kawsay. An autonomous space to practice it has always been available to mashikuna for it is essential to their continuance and identity. However, in the 21st century ayllu the practice of sumak kawsay, mashi identity, and their resistance against inequality takes place within an empowered position unparalleled in recent history.",Ecuador,-78.183406,-1.831239,6

Sociology",Sociology,Kum-Kum Bhavnani,"This study explores women's work in Ecuador in rose production.

However, some farms like Fairtrade-certified Nevado Roses, in southern Ecuador, pride themselves on their ethical and fair policies towards workers. My research fills a gap in the literature by contributing an ethnographic account of worker perspectives on Fairtrade rose production. I address the following questions: Who are the women working in Fairtrade flowers and what do they think about their jobs? How does women's work in flowers affect their efforts to manage daily life and the future? How are the experiences of workers in a Fairtrade flower farm different from reported experiences on uncertified farms or farms with other certifications? Following over fifty in-depth interviews, I show that Nevado women have better working conditions than workers on uncertified farms and more opportunity for participation in workplace policy than workers on farms with other ethical certification. Most said they enjoy their jobs. Yet the gendered challenges of balancing home and work highlight the inadequacy of employer and social support for reproductive labor, specifically childcare. In line with Bhavnani, Foran and Kurian (2003), I argue that women must be centered in all development of global society, and that masculinist conceptions of work do not offer women a chance to improve their whole lives.",Ecuador,-78.183406,-1.831239,6

Global and International Studies",Global and International Studies,Paul Amar,"The pivotal role Islamism will play in the post-Arab Spring global dynamic drives this thesis. It analyses the various origins and ideologies of the most seminal Islamist movement, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. As Egypt serves as the socio-political fulcrum of the Middle East North Africa region, so too stands the Muslim Brotherhood as the logical genesis for a discussion about the larger phenomenon of Islamism. My thesis argues that the Brotherhood specifically, and Islamism generally, offers far more flexibility in ideology than the West frequently concedes. Its development proves non-linear, complex and frequently interrupted by bifurcation; the ideologies it produced and still produces are therefore polymorphic, ranging from moderate and conciliatory to belligerent and radical. Which, if any, Islamism prevails in the Middle East will depend on the abilities of the various movements' leaders to offer beneficial alternatives to the decades of tyranny the masses rejected in the Arab Spring. I argue that by returning to the ideology of the Brotherhood's founding father, Hassan al-Banna, a moderate, conciliatory, and above all flexible interpretation of Islamism may be found. This requires a reconsideration of the radicalism that has spiraled out of the ranks of the Brotherhood, specifically acknowledging Sayyid Qutb's writings as aberrations of al Banna's message, rather than as natural evolutions. I conclude that Islamism and radical Islamism must be separated in academic and political discourse, treated as related but separate phenomena, in order to push the quotidial dialogue in a mutually generative direction. To do this, I first trace the historical trajectory of the Brotherhood, highlighting incidences of flexibility and cooperative methods of the movement to insure its survival through the tumultuous post-Colonial era. The second section highlights the Brotherhood's oscillations between radical and moderate ideological positions. My analysis demonstrates that the Muslim Brotherhood has a long history of pragmatic response to changing political situations. The West too often views the Muslim Brotherhood through the ""Clash of Civilization"" narrative -- in which the Muslim Brotherhood is one continuous, fixed entity in opposition to the West -- rather than acknowledging the bifurcated and malleable identity of the organization.",Egypt,30.802498,26.820553,13

History",History,Elizabeth DePalma Digeser,"This work argues that the presence of ""alchemical"" and ""magical"" material found in papyri dated to the third or fourth century CE must be related to the declining local aristocracy of the Roman empire and to their educated clients. Jacco Dieleman, Ian Moyer and mostly David Frankfurter, first described the Greek and Demotic Magical Papyri (part of the Anastasi papyri collection) as the work of Egyptian priests responding to the wishes of Greco-Roman aristocrats who traveled to Egypt in search of mageia . The conclusion of my work suggests two alternative modifications to the current interpretive framework: either (1) the Anastasi papyri were not solely the work of Egyptian priests but also of a social group of ""dependent scholars,"" men trained in Greek learning but economically dependent, and thus associated with a patron; or (2) from a socio-economic point of view, there was practically no difference between many late antique ""Greco-Egyptian priests"" and ""dependent scholars"" who used handbooks of recipes to maintain or promote the status of their patrons (alternatively the patrons could very well have used the books themselves). Persian philosophy (mageia) was a popular topic of study among late antique philosophers and we should expect ancient education to have generally accepted research on the magoi as a valid topic of inquiry (chapter one). A misunderstanding of the subject of ""magical"" study in turn pushed patrons to ask their dependent scholars for curses and divination (chapter two). Scholars (e.g. Apion ""Pleistonikes"") who were known as sorcerers were generally attached to patrons, involved in sympotic entertainment (esp. in the form of paignia) and in natural philosophy (chapter three). Comparing dependent scholars with each other shows that they read or wrote recipes that were considered to be magical by more established scholars (chapter four). The presence of paignia and of other performance-related recipes in the Anastasi papyri strongly suggests the kind of sympotic environment and of intellectual patronage referred to in the preceding chapters (chapter five). The same conclusion must be drawn a fortiori for P. Leid. and P. Holm., which are constituted of recipes for the counterfeiting of luxury items (chapter six).",Egypt,30.802498,26.820553,13

Sociology",Sociology,William I. Robinson,"Policing the Wretched examines the transnationalization of systems of racism, class exploitation, criminalization, militarized policing, and social control throughout North and Central America in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century. It provides a sociological, historical, and materialist analysis of the militarization of the Los Angeles Police Department, the policing of youth and surplus labor populations in El Salvador, the so-called ""war on drugs"" in Mexico, and the emergence of hip hop as a cultural form of expression in the heavily policed Pico Union district of Los Angeles to conceptualize what I call ""transnational apparatuses of social control"". It demonstrates that during the epoch of global capitalism, repressive nation-state apparatuses have taken transnational dimensions. It shows that these forms of social control should be understood alongside neoliberal policies such as structural adjustments programs (SAPs) and free trade policies, and the proposed ""wars"" on drugs, crime, gangs, terrorism, and anti-migrant policies in this region. It illustrates that the transnationalization of social control emerged as a response to social and economic crises that have developed from neoliberalism, racial and social inequality, and the emergence of grassroots social movements. While remaining attentive to the repressive apparatuses of social control in a transnational context, Policing the Wretched also examines how social movements in Los Angeles, Mexico City, and San Salvador have contested neoliberal policies, security initiatives, and militarization. Through interviews, participant observations, and archival research (government documents, congressional reports, and studies; presidential addresses; media sources and journalist accounts; and non-governmental literature, studies, and research) spanning three countries, the project traces the ways in which social movements in the U.S., Mexico, and El Salvador have mobilized and waged a relentless struggle over hegemony that provides an alternative social warrant that places democracy over securitization and human rights over property rights. It concludes by showing how hip hop in Los Angeles delineates acritique of transnational social control and a culture of resistance. The three different sites (Los Angeles, Mexico City, and San Salvador) exemplify the linkages of transnational methods of social control and opposition during the epoch of global capitalism.",El Salvador,88.8965,13.7942,1

Aranye Fradenburg,"This dissertation explores Middle English literary texts that consistently portray ethics as a patently emotional affair. The introduction rehashes recent neuroscientific discourses that similarly assert the centrality of emotion in processes of ethical decision-making, as well as other contemporary theoretical and historiographic accounts of emotion. Chapter 1 argues that Middle English rhetorics of righteous and sinful anger played an important role both in sparking the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 and in retroactively reevaluating the dangers of uninhibited anger in the uprising's posttramatic wake. The second chapter discusses Middle English discourses on dread that suggest that devotees in late medieval England conceptualized the ascetic project of dreading well as integral to the ethical project of living well. The third chapter argues that the three successive versions of Piers Plowman, as we know them today, contain three strikingly different theologies of love and dread. Rather than reading these as evidence of one man's gradual movement from a theology of dread to one of love, it reimagines the production of Piers Plowman as a densely intersubjective affair that engendered a network of differing (and deferring) theologies of love and dread. Chapter 4 turns to the famous Middle English elegy Pearl, arguing that the Pearl-maiden does not prompt the dreamer to happily share in her celestial estate, but instead stirs his envy of her heavenly bliss, suggesting that terrestrial devotees ought to work through, rather than eschew, their envy of their celestial loved ones. Chapter 5 focuses on another poem solely attested in Cotton Nero A.x: Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. While critics often read Gawain's shame at the end of the poem as sundering him from his fellow courtiers, I read Gawain's shameful confession to the court as profoundly and successfully reparative of the homosocial, chivalric habitus wounded by Gawain's life loving transgression. Moving next to Geoffrey Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, Chapter 6 builds on a scholarly tradition that reads Troilus as a masochistic courtly lover, arguing that, at the poem's conclusion, Troilus spontaneously transforms into a sadistic courtly hater. Since masochistic courtly love and sadistic courtly hate constitute different responses to social privilege, the courtly lover always already possesses the potential to morph suddenly into a courtly hater, as does Chaucer's Troilus when he channels his disappointment at having lost Criseyde's love into vengeful, militarized violence against any and all Greeks. Finally, by way of conclusion, I discuss some of the pedagogical implications of my research into Middle English ideologies of emotion, focusing particularly on the vexed question of how one might ethically teach medieval cultures of compassion.",England,-1.1743197,52.3555177,13

English",English,"Carol Pasternack, Patricia Fumerton","Medieval and Early Modern English writers consistently affirmed interspecies connections between humans and birds in order to meditate upon ethical approaches towards others, and in order to understand the rhythms of the larger systems (both earthly and heavenly) in which all creatures participate. Building upon recent work in animal studies by literary critics and other philosophers, my dissertation counters the view that early writers used animals only symbolically. Instead, I use close-readings of four key works (the Anglo-Saxon Seafarer, Chaucer's House of Fame, Pembroke's translation of Psalm 68, and Shakespeare's Macbeth) to show how some of English literature's most prominent early texts represent interspecies commonality as occurring at three levels: material embodiment, social experience, and immaterial spirituality. While different writers across this long period voiced their avian characters in various ways, from onomatopoetic renderings of bird sounds to putting human speech in their beaks, a commitment to naturalistic depiction of avian habits is visible throughout. Also prominent is a sense that birds are eerily human-like. Their complex social structures, vocal communication, and song resemble human practices. Birds, however, have something we have always longed for: flight. This makes them the earthly animals physically closest to heaven, granting them a liminal status in which they are both deeply creaturely and also closest to the Creator. I suggest that such poetic renderings become particularly prominent at times of expansion of emergent media technology, because animal communities and communications can become a focus of human nostalgia for simpler forms. They also become sites of anxiety about what is lost---including a feeling of lost ethical virtue---when technology changes the human social landscape. The current animal turn is related to earlier such turns, and all are influenced by changing media.",England,-1.1743197,52.3555177,13

English",English,Heather Blurton,"The architectural theory of access analysis contends that the deepest spaces of architecture, those that take the most architectural steps to reach, are the highest status spaces in an architectural structure. Aristocratic women were placed in these spaces both historically and in the literature of medieval England. Gaining access to these spaces and to the female bodies that inhabited them thus conferred status on the men who were lucky enough to do so. Social status was highly fluid and often contested in high to late medieval England. The highly charged tower with its association with high status therefore became a site around which social status could be contested. In this dissertation, I examine how authors whose status was contested---the cleric and the civil servant---manipulated the trope of the entowered woman to negotiate their own status. I do so by first situating the tropes as part of a real, historical understanding of castle architecture, rather than as part of an allegorical program. I then build on New Historicist theories that imagine the text as entering contemporary social conversations, but I further those theories by following so-called New Materialists, who argue that objects can have material effects in the historical world. Following Pierre Bourdieu, I consider texts not just as art qua art, but commodities jockeying for status in an economic and social world. I bridge the divide between discursive, ideological ""effects"" theorized by New Historicists and the material effects of what I consider to be the complex assemblage of the text, which is not reducible to the physical material of the text or the discursive/linguistic ""matter"" of the text. I argue that texts are a special kind of commodity, one in which the labor of the maker, the author, is not abstracted in the exchange process. The text, as it circulates via manuscript, carries with it, in the linguistic signs on the page, the intention of the author. As male authors imaginatively accessed the high status space of tower and its female occupant in the literature they produced, they thus made a radical claim for increasing their own social status. The dissertation concludes with a consideration of the women of the historical Paston family, who serve as a counterpoint to the ubiquitous trope of the entowered woman, as they chose to live in the lower status architectural program of the gentry manor house, where women were not relegated to the inaccessible space of the castle tower. Starting with the Biblical Song of Songs, architectural structures of the castle and tower have served as a metaphor for women's bodies. Throughout the Middle Ages, this metaphor continued to stand in for the female body, emphasizing a desire in the cultural imagination that the female body should be impenetrable, their sexuality carefully controlled. With the advent of castle architecture in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, the castle tower also became metonymically linked with the female body as women historically occupied this deepest---that is, the most architecturally inaccessible---space of the castle.

English",English,James Kearney,"My project examines the female complaint: the vogue in sixteenth-century England for male poets adopting female personae. In particular, I set out to explore the function of the complaint's feminine personae in the poets' representations of themselves as authors. The conventional critical reading suggests that the poets adopt female personae in order to master a female voice and thereby assert their own authorial presence. I contend, however, that this reading has a reductive effect on our understanding of both authorship and gender. By developing an alternate interpretation of this phenomenon that takes seriously these poets attempts to identify with their female subjects, I show how the female complaint is deployed to explore the boundaries between display and exposure these poets negotiated as their literary projects moved from the complex intimacies of manuscript exchange to the public realm of print. The female complaint, I argue, allowed authors to negotiate the changing relationship to their print readership, patrons, and stationers. On the one hand, as a state of abjection, femininity sets the poets and their subjects off from other texts, allowing them to distinguish themselves in a type of self-promotion. On the other hand, abjection contained this self-promotion within a framework of humility and dependence. Thus the poems allowed poets to promote themselves to broad, new reading publics while still decorously presenting themselves to their patrons.

English",English,James Kearney,"This project examines the female revenger on the early modern stage and how this figure dramatizes cultural tensions about gendered identity in early modern England. Despite the tremendous critical attention early modern revenge tragedy has received, and despite attempts to read revenge in relation to gender, few scholars have offered a sustained reading of the female revenger. By focusing almost entirely on male revengers, studies of revenge tragedy have created an oversimplified narrative of the revenge tradition and its relation to conceptions of gender in the early modern period. I contend that female revengers on the Renaissance stage have a profoundly different relationship to revenge than their male counterparts, who are typically characterized as effeminate and self-alienated. I begin with the simple observation that female revengers of the Elizabethan period are able to channel the dangerous passion of revenge without experiencing any threat to their sense of self. My project tracks a shift in the gendering of revenge and charts the gradual disempowerment of the female revenger across the early modern period, relating the diminished rhetorical agency of the figure to shifting cultural ideas about the passions, heroism and the gendered body. I trace this female revenger from neo-Stoic translations of Seneca in the 1560s, particularly John Studley's reworking of Seneca's Medea, through plays from the 1580s and 1590s (Kyd's The Spanish Tragedy, Shakespeare's Henry VI tetralogy and Titus Andronicus, and the anonymous Arden of Faversham) and the Stuart stage (Shirley's The Maid's Revenge and John Ford's 'Tis Pity She's a Whore and Love's Sacrifice). I conclude the dissertation with Ravenscroft's rewriting of Shakespeare's Titus Andronicus and Congreve's comedy, The Way of the World, arguing that the failure of female revenge on the Restoration stage demonstrates a shift in the perception of revenge from an 'effeminizing' heated and embodied drive to a rational, if amoral, masculine ""dish best served cold."" By highlighting the critically neglected figure of the female revenger and tracking its transformation from the Elizabethan era through the Restoration, my project challenges our understanding of both the revenge tradition and early modern gender.",England,-1.1743197,52.3555177,13

Historians writing on the teaching of evolution in schools have focused almost exclusively on the United States, where it has been surrounded by creationist opposition and judicial contention. This dissertation is the first comprehensive historical study of such teaching in England, Darwin's homeland, whose state schools also included mandatory religious education. It investigates four important aspects: the expansion and content of evolution in science curricula; how religious education classes dealt with evolution; what role the teaching of evolution played in secularization; and how the English case differed from the American. I navigate England's localized, complex school system, with its highly variable curricula, mainly via external examination boards' syllabuses, textbooks, counties' ""agreed syllabuses"" of religious education, educational journals, and archival records of science and religious education organizations. For English thinkers the debate lay not between creation and evolution; by the late nineteenth century, English clergy had come to accept the common descent of man and animals from primitive forms. Rather the contention among educators centered on evolutionary mechanism, pitting Darwinism's random variation and natural selection against teleological theories of evolution, or those based on predesigned goals and directed change. Was man a cosmic accident or was he created in the image of God? I offer three conclusions. First, English schools failed to give students satisfactory answers regarding Darwinism and Christian doctrine, preferring avoidance, obfuscation, vagaries, appeals to mystery, or reconciliation via non-Darwinian theories. Second, the teaching of the Darwinian mechanism played only a small part in sparking England's great secularization in the 1960s, because its haphazard nature was non-existent or clouded in most students' education before the 1970s. Nevertheless, evolution teaching still significantly contributed to this secularization by conflicting with some students' imbibed Biblical literalism or by offering escape from the God hypothesis. Third, England's state religious education gave rise to science trumping religion while America's separation of church and state facilitated fundamentalist-influenced students' rejection of evolution.",England,-1.1743197,52.3555177,13

History",History,Sharon Farmer,"This dissertation explores the relationship between religious and racial persecution by examining Christian responses to converted Jews in thirteenth- and fourteenth-century northern France. By reconstructing attitudes of Christian intellectuals towards the possibility of Jewish conversion and exploring the socio-economic status and integration of converts, the dissertation clarifies the degree to which Judaism was believed to be inextricably linked to identity in medieval France. The dissertation draws on financial and administrative records to reconstruct the career trajectory of Philippe le Convers, a high-level royal agent and the godson of King Philip the Fair (r. 1285--1314). Other prominent medieval converts, such as Henry of Winchester in England, eventually faced limits to their ability to integrate into Christian society, but Philippe's status as a convert does not appear to have limited his career---or his influence at court---in any way. The dissertation also draws on evidence from property records, guild records, and tax assessments to examine the socio-economic status of other French converts, showing that a significant number of converts were well integrated into multiple sectors of the Parisian working world in the late thirteenth century. Parisian converts lived and worked in Christian neighborhoods throughout the city, and a significant number of Parisian converts practiced lucrative, prestigious trades. Some Parisian converts formed associations with prominent bourgeois by gaining access to Christian guilds or by marrying into well-placed bourgeois families. The dissertation also draws on narrative sources, such as chronicles and ecclesiastical visitation registers, in order to explore Christian chroniclers' perceptions of converted Jews from the late twelfth through the late fourteenth century, arguing that Christian chroniclers in France began to express heightened concerns about the status and trustworthiness of French converts, as a group, only after the expulsions of Jews from France in the early fourteenth century. France was one of the earliest countries to implement a national expulsion of Jews, and French policies played a major role in establishing the tone of anti-Jewish legislation throughout medieval Europe. Other studies have shown that the persecution of Jews intensified in northern Europe in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and scholars have assumed that negative attitudes towards Jews must have applied to converts, as well. However, this dissertation argues that until the expulsions of the early fourteenth century, French converts were well integrated into Christian society and that evidence from a broad range of sources demonstrates a growing concern about the status and trustworthiness of converts in France only after the waves of expulsions in the fourteenth century.",England,-1.1743197,52.3555177,13

History",History,James Sears McGee,"Histories tracing the evolution of the modern British navy nearly all begin their examinations of the fleet during the Cromwellian Protectorate or early restoration England of the mid-to-late seventeenth century. While such studies abound, few recognize the fundamental importance of the growth and restructuring of the navy during the English Civil Wars, beginning in 1642. In my study of the first year of the parliamentary navy I argue that the origin of the modern British Navy should be traced back a decade before the Protectorate to the civil war fleet and the first navy to be run by parliament rather than the king. Understanding that the men and vessels of the civil war navy are integral and overlooked progenitors to the fleets that followed them also highlights the importance of that navy to the origins and early military campaigns of the English Civil War. By more fully recognizing the centrality of debates surrounding the navy and how the successes and stresses of the fleet shaped the conflict between King Charles I and parliament in 1642-3 this dissertation connects the fleet back to other important wartime events in England and on the continent instead of examining it in the maritime vacuum in which it is so often considered. By integrating the civil war navy's history into the social, political, military and economic context of the English Civil War, my work shows how the context in which the civil war navy was funded and operated created a fleet that linked the Caroline and Protectorate navy. Furthermore, examining the war's evolution in the context of events related to the navy---instead of the other way around---I provide an additional angle to complement existing studies that consider why the war developed in the specific way it did through the summer of 1643.",England,-1.1743197,52.3555177,13

History",History,J. Sears McGee,"Historians and literary scholars now recognize and build upon the insights they offer each other in understanding early modern political and literary culture by relying on sources and methodologies previously considered separate domains. This dissertation furthers this interdisciplinary methodology through an analysis of the significant Jacobean court ceremonies and their accompanying festivities from roughly 1603 to 1613. These major events of state usually entailed the production and publication of religious and literary works and descriptions of the ceremonies which expressed various attempts to define the significance of the event. It is argued here that the significance and meaning of Jacobean ceremonies were deeply contested along political, religious, and ideological lines. During James's coronation, John Whitgift and Thomas Bilson urged the king to protect episcopacy in England at the same time they disagreed with each other on the nature of the Church of England. Despite earlier interpretations, Henry's investiture as Prince of Wales, Ben Jonson's Prince Henries Barriers, and Samuel Daniel's Tethys Festival reflected a temporary alignment of James's political goals and Henry's ideology. Daniel Price delivered six sermons before the court in the month between the prince's death and his funeral that argued for the continued importance of the protestant cause ideology, denounced the ascendancy of the crypto-Catholic Howard faction, and decried the appearance an anti-Calvinist strain of theology in the universities. At the marriage of Princess Elizabeth and Frederick, elector Palatine, Thomas Campion's Lords Maske called attention to James's intentions for the marriage, while John King's sermon pointed to the dangers of a Catholic union and highlighted a protestant cause interpretation of the event. Both George Chapman's Memorable Masque and Francis Beaumont's Masque of the Inner Temple also linked the wedding to the protestant cause ideology, but Chapman expressed concerns about James's fiscal policies and the rise of court favorite Robert Carr, Viscount Rochester. Finally, Anthony Maxey closed the week-long celebration with a Lenten sermon that espoused an anti-Calvinist ideology, exposing precisely the sort of ""threat"" warned against by Price and King.",England,-1.1743197,52.3555177,13

History of Art and Architecture",History of Art and Architecture,Ann Jensen Adams,"Traditions informing the deceptions perpetrated by seventeenth-century trompe-l'oeil paintings shine considerable light on the behavior of seventeenth-century artists, patrons, and viewers in unexpected ways. This study considers illusionistic paintings and written accounts of those experiencing them in the seventeenth century in conjunction with non-art historical scientific, philosophical, and social discourses of the period concerned with the subject of deceit. Questions on naturalism that remain a central subject in Netherlandish History of Art and Architecture are elaborated upon, for, when considered deceptive, artists and their paintings reveal a variety of intriguing concerns. From this perspective, this dissertation argues that artists and their patrons fostered viewing responses that are surprisingly ideological with wide-ranging political and intellectual ramifications dependent on the immediate contexts in which they were made. To lie well, particularly in such a way that revealed the clever machinations of the deceit and established the participants' mastery of the subtleties of a given set of values, was a highly-desirable social and political achievement. Beautifully painted lies facilitated this exploration of deception. The complicity of original sites of trompe-l'oeil reception in the deceptive act -- in physical locations like artists' studios, churches, town halls, homes, and the marketplace -- was determined by attitudes to deceit specific to these contexts. A painting that lies will encourage very different responses determined by the expectations of the participants. The place of deception in the visual arts, and painting in particular, was a practice informed by professional concerns, art theory, and economic pursuits favored by seventeenth-century Netherlandish artists. The production of illusionistic painting by the artist Cornelis Norbertus Gijsbrechts for the Danish kings in the 1660s and 70s in particular terms of the complimentary goals of an emerging absolutist court and of the knowledge-producing system of a kunstkammer. Alternatively, two illusionistically painted organ screens painted for prominent churches in Amsterdam, one by Cornelis Brise and the other by Gerard de Lairesse, provides an entirely different set of responses within a context dominated by Protestant concerns and contemporaneous controversies. In this environment, the delicate balance between morally proscribed lies and the activation of compelling visual deceptions underscores the visual appeal of trompe-l'oeil art of this period. The trompe-l'oeil paintings of Samuel van Hoogstraten and several of his contemporaries produced deceptive imagery for middle-class and royal patrons in Restoration England. Analysis of the written experiences of the bureaucrat Samuel Pepys with their illusions, serves as a means of accessing the social pressures and intellectual pursuits that responded to, and in turn informed, artistic production. By expanding the cultural referents of deception to include those determined by the immediate contexts for which trompe-l'oeil paintings were made, our understanding of a seemingly homogenous sub-genre is made far more complicated and versatile.",England,-1.1743197,52.3555177,13

Music",Music,Stefanie Tcharos,"John Dryden (1631--1700) and George Frederic Handel (1685--1759) produced literary and musical works that have long been regarded as icons of English culture. Their respective arts merged in the late 1730s when Handel took up two of Dryden's most famous poems, ""Alexander's Feast"" (1736) and ""A Song for St. Cecilia's Day"" (1739) and re-set them to music. This dissertation probes the genesis of Dryden's poems through a survey of the religious and political climate of the seventeenth century. I juxtapose Dryden's possible poetic intents in writing the poems with Handel's response to those intents. After offering an interpretive reading of the poems and the music I consider the evolution and significance of the myth of St. Cecilia as musical patroness in early modern England as well as her influence on both men. I also consider Handel's use of fugue in each work, a compositional tact which allowed him to circumscribe the works as quasi-religious. I argue that Handel understood Dryden's literary stature and used his semi-sacred poems to explore the divide of sacred and secular entertainment in England. My study indicates that Handel approached ""A Song for St. Cecilia's Day"" with a greater degree of compositional caution and diffidence than seen in his setting of ""Alexander's Feast,"" thereby possibly honoring Dryden's wish that music should remain a ""sensible"" art with textual clarity of primary concern. In Alexander's Feast, however, Handel treats the dramatic personae with a sort of inventive wit and pathos that seems lacking in A Song for St. Cecilia's Day. In tracing the evolution and reception of these poems from Dryden's pen to Handel's settings of them, I note how Dryden's words reflect the anxieties of his age regarding the rise of music as an independent entity. Handel's response to this anxiety and the way in which his work was embraced by the English public indicate a major shift in eighteenth-century thought regarding the status of music. Alexander's Feast and A Song for St. Cecilia's Day embody Handel's early creative exploits as he sought, artistically and commercially, to broach the divide of musical entertainment deemed sacred and secular.",England,-1.1743197,52.3555177,13

Theater Studies",Theater Studies,Simon Williams,"This dissertation interrogates the role of adaptation in creating and maintaining hegemonic cultural formations through a study of two tragedies by Euripides as they were adapted by neoclassical playwrights during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in France and England. Adaptation studies, a relatively new field of academic inquiry, has thus far largely focused on defining adaptation in relation to more established studies of translation and intertextuality, and has primarily concentrated on cross-medium adaptations such as novels adapted into film. Taking these focuses as a point of departure, this study expands the field of adaptation studies by looking at adaptation not across medium, but across time and culture, through the examination of stage plays that were rewritten for public performance in early modern Western Europe hundreds of years after their initial performances in ancient Greece. In this context, with no change in medium, the uses of adaptation as a tool for disguising cultural difference are revealed, refocusing the scholarly discussion of adaptation from a search for definitions to an exploration of its implications for cultural studies. Exploring the ways in which new ideas about religion, gender, and morality made unadapted Greek tragedies unsuitable for public presentation on early modern stages, the case studies examine the alterations made in nine different adaptations of the two Iphigenia plays that have come down to us from ancient Athens. Looking at adaptations of adaptations (Gluck's operatic adaptation of Racine's retelling of Iphigenia in Aulis, for example) alongside direct adaptations of Greek tragedies, this study argues that local cultural conventions may be threatened by even very recent versions of a story, and that adaptation is leveraged accordingly in order to neutralize such ideological threats. In the process, this exploration traces the ways in which neoclassicism was interpreted and reinterpreted as it shifted times, locations, and genres: from the seventeenth century to the eighteenth, France to England, and spoken tragedy to opera.",England,-1.1743197,52.3555177,13

The remaining few of these parasites live in sub-Saharan and Sahelian Africa in the countries of Chad, Ethiopia, Mali, and South Sudan. By the end of 2010 there were fewer than 1,800 cases of Guinea worm reported worldwide, an astonishing decrease from the estimated 3.5 million reported cases in 1980 when the international eradication effort began. There is no vaccine or preventative medicine to inoculate against the parasite and the eradication effort has focused on an educational program, teaching those at risk how to prevent infection. Through education and community programs to improve access to clean and safe drinking water, it is hoped that the parasite will have been eliminated from the waters worldwide in the near future. The goal of this research is to understand how Guinea worm has reemerged in regions where it had once been eliminated. A current hurdle to the eradication effort is to supervise the regions where Guinea worm once existed to ensure there is no reemergence. There have been several incidents of reemergence in the past and the work for this dissertation examines historical data on Guinea worm reemergence to better understand the process and identify the most suitable methods for locating regions at risk for reemergence. Results of this analysis show that specific transportation networks and medical facilities may play a role in determining the spread of Guinea worm as it reestablishes itself in a region. This work reiterates that both disease transmission and species abundance are fundamentally spatial processes and that the incorporation of spatial approaches provides new insights into the nature of Guinea worm reemergence.

Environmental science and management",Environmental science and management,Christopher Costello,"Economic incentives for users of natural resources depend on both environmental conditions and policies in place to govern use of those resources. Similarly, polluting firms are financially impacted by the regulatory context in which they operate and the manner in which natural systems exposed to their pollution are affected. Shifts in environmental conditions or policy thus may alter the economic incentives and behavior of resource users and polluting firms. To the extent that such shifts impose higher costs, economic theory suggests that economic agents will seek ways to mitigate their exposure to such costs, either through preventative behavior or adaptation. As a result, the economic effects of change will depend upon the responses of affected individuals or firms. Here, I examine the effects of three types of change on the behavior of natural resource users and polluting firms. The first chapter employs dynamic game theory to examine the effect of a potential environmental regime shift on coalition formation in a shared fishery, finding that the threat of such shifts can support enhanced cooperation as a means to avoid the shift. The second chapter focuses attention on a policy shift in a multi-species fishery, studying how resource users respond to the introduction of tradable permits for bycatch species. That study uses a combination of theory and panel econometric approaches to identify multi-margin responses to the regulatory change, and in so doing, estimates the marginal costs of conservation for overfished species. In the final chapter, I continue to examine regulatory change, but shift systems to examine how environmental policy may stimulate innovation. In particular, I explore how tradable emissions permits can create incentives for unregulated firms to innovate, illustrating the consequences of such spillovers for policy analysis using both theory and an empirical application to the European Union Emissions Trading System.",European Union,-77.0483959,38.9028939,1

Cottle,"As an active continent-continent collision zone, the Himalayan orogen provides a superb natural laboratory to study a wide range of tectonic processes. One process inexorably linked to tectonism is melt generation, which can occur in a multitude of ways. Partial melting of continental crust, anatexis, typically produces migmatites and melts of granitic composition. Studying these granites in their geologic context allows placement of age maxima and minima for tectonic events, thus allowing evaluation of tectonic hypotheses. This study examines the timescales of anatexis and melt mobilization in the Ama Drime Massif (ADM), an exposure of mid-to-lower-crustal material in the Everest region. The ADM crosscuts a major Miocene fault system, the South Tibetan Detachment System (STDS), and is structurally lower than the GHS. Thus, it provides valuable information about post-STDS Himalayan tectonics. Using laser ablation inductively coupled mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS), U(-Th)-Pb geochronology of accessory minerals in leucogranite intrusions in the ADM demonstrates that, compared with the overlying GHS, melting in the ADM was short-lived---the entire range of granite crystallization occurred over _6 m.y.

Finally, intercalation of French farce in Italian comedy sheds new light on the integration of Renaissance Italian theatrical culture in France at the end of the sixteenth century and raises issues of ""international relations"" in the field of theatrical studies. This study analyzes the experimental use of units of theater from the medieval French farce tradition in Pierantonio Stricca Legacci's Cilombrino (1518), Salvestro Cartaio's Il Travaglio (The Torment) (1552), and Antonfrancesco Grazzini's L'Arzigogolo (The Quibble) (c. 1580). It asks questions such as: Did French military presence in Italy or the substantial Italian population in France have a specific effect on the theatrical productions of the sixteenth century? For what reasons would the French farce have appealed to experimental Tuscan literary academies of the sixteenth century, and how would Tuscan playwrights have come into contact with the French genre? In what ways were units of farce appropriated as models of progressive theater for and by these academies? Finally, what role did politics play in the comedic creations of the sixteenth-century theater? Could only laughter speak the truth to power as embodied by the French monarchy and the Medici regime? How did this hybrid comic theater critique the conventions of humanist imitation? By examining the formal relationships between medieval French farce and Italian Renaissance comedy through close investigation of thematic and textual borrowings, as well as stagecraft, this study authenticates Tuscan comedy as a ""contact zone"" for transalpine intercultural exchange, involving both material exchanges (print, letters, staging features, audio-visual effects) and semiotic ones (symbols, themes, topoi). The French farce appealed to the experimental, avant-garde Tuscan dramatists of the sixteenth century as a model from which to appropriate a new kind of comic theater. Through the intercalation of Tuscan drama with the French farce, playwrights of the Congrega dei Rozzi in Siena and the Accademia degli Umidi in Florence created some of the first examples of hybrid genres of early modern theater; this intertextual phenomenon continued to gain popularity throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. By probing the connection between politics and the French farce, I show how inimitably suited this genre was to the needs of sixteenth-century Tuscan dramatists. This theatrical tradition allowed for the representation of key social tensions and contradictions that humanist comedy may otherwise have been unable to express theatrically without threatening to disrupt and undermine social stability. With an emphasis on interaction of theatrical forms, as well as a focus on the social, cultural, and historical factors that influenced these cultural productions, this dissertation offers a socio-semiotic reading of the construction of early modern European comedy, particularly in regard to humanism, imitation, and international cultural exchange.",Florence,11.2558136,43.7695604,1

This revitalization of the residential community was spawned by the passage of an Adaptive Reuse Ordinance by the Los Angeles City Council in 1999 enabling developers to renovate underutilized and abandoned office and commercial buildings into apartments and lofts. The first apartments renovated under this ordinance were ready for occupancy in August 2000.

History",History,John Majewski,"My dissertation project details the interconnections of race, labor, and land usage overtime from the late-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth-century U.S. South. To examine these themes closely, I focus on the Red Hills region, a forty-mile stretch of land between Thomas County, in southern Georgia, and Tallahassee, Florida. The area became a winter colony for wealthy northern hunters in the decades after Reconstruction, and thus prospered from regional tourism--a growing theme in scholarly studies of the New South. Northern hunters, almost all wealthy industrialists, consolidated land in the region, thus closing lands that would have otherwise been available for small-scale farming and for use as common hunting grounds. They employed a mostly African-American labor force to work on their estates as domestic servants, dog handlers, liverymen, and as sharecroppers and tenant farmers. By displacing whites and employing local blacks, hunting plantations became a divisive force in the town. Plantation owners were concerned with implementing what they considered to be a progressive labor policy with regards to their southern workers. What resulted was a model of welfare capitalism in which white owners created worker communities and subsidized homes, automobiles, and health care, in return for a workforce that remained closely clustered and thus under constant scrutiny. According to oral testimonies and memoirs from black plantation workers, white northerners fostered opportunities for class mobility in a place where labor was limited to agricultural or poorly paid domestic work, but they also circumscribed black action in many ways. As a scholarly case study, the Red Hills Region brings into relief lines of race, class, and regionalism in postwar society. As a public history project, the study allows for close work with Red Hills community members to document and interpret elements of the community's past that have previously gone unstudied.",Florida,-81.5157535,27.6648274,5

As French overseas departments, both Martinique's and Guadeloupe's public school system has been imported from France and thus imposes an alienating French emphasis on West Indian consciousness and identity. Yet theatre offers a new place for cultural education because it can instill pride, consciousness and identity in a localized form particular to Martinique and Guadeloupe. This important educational function is especially notable in the plays analyzed here, which are virtually absent from the critical literature on the French Caribbean, yet clearly merit a closer look. I examine a corpus of over twenty French West Indian plays. I consider these plays as cultural manifestations of what Martinicans and Guadeloupians value and disparage. I look at this theatre also as a national theatre wherein a narrative of the nation is fabricated and affirmed publically. I study Martinicans and Guadeloupians through their theatrical cultural manifestations which themselves focus on historical and contemporary events. Thus my analysis contributes cultural and historical depth to the rapidly evolving field of French Caribbean theatre criticism.

The early 1960s were a crucial time when many colonies were fighting for and gaining independence. Although not directly engaged in anti-colonial struggles, Martinicans and Gaudeloupians nevertheless participated in independence movements and theatre was a significant arena for articulating these issues. Prior to this moment, imitation and reproduction of French theatre, culture, and society reigned; from the 1960s onward, playwrights focused on the expression and resuscitation of local history and culture. To facilitate this expression, many writers turned toward popular movements such as Negritude, Antillanite, and Creolite, enabling a cultural education and affirming an identity particular to both Martinique and Guadeloupe.",France,2.213749,46.227638,18

With an emphasis on literary and historical representations of the marginalized exotic other in terms of the spectacle, nomadism, exoticism and witchcraft, this dissertation offers a cultural reading of the origins of Bohemian Paris as related to self-imposed marginality. This study analyzes the literary myth of the female Gypsy and jazz dancer figures in Victor Hugo's Notre-Dame de Paris, George Sand's Consuelo, Prosper Merimee's Carmen, Louis-Charles Caigniez's melodrama, La petite Bohemienne, Paul Morand's Magie noire and Josephine Baker's films, asking the questions: How were the myths of la Bohemienne and la danseuse de jazz appropriated as models of marginality for the self-exiled bohemian artist? How should we define the idealization of freedom for the Romantics and later the Avant-garde as exemplified by the myth of the marginalized other? How close to the original marginalized culture was this mythologized ideal? Comparative analyses of the bohemian artist figure in Theophile Gautier's Les Jeunes-France and Henry Murger's Scenes de la vie de Boheme further elucidate the bohemian artists' methods of appropriating this marginalized lifestyle. By examining the relationship between the myth of the Gypsy and the bohemian artist figure through close investigation of stereotypes, representations and applications in literary and historical texts, this study aims to shed new light on the ways in which countercultural identities and communities are formed and regenerated.",France,2.213749,46.227638,18

French",French,Catherine Nesci,"Une blouse, ""le chapeau,"" ""Le Temps en jupons."" As women journalists of France's Third Republic sought to break out into the public sphere and report the daily news from their own angle, they were regularly greeted by confused bystanders and fellow journalists who wrote them off as nothing more than the articles of clothing that announced their (lesser) sex: blouses, hats, and slips. This often hostile environment, however, failed to discourage several women journalists who reported the daily news from their marginalized perspective: Severine, Colette, and Andree Viollis. The reportages by these three women offer us new perspectives on the everyday stories of their era as well as the critical questions of women's suffrage, war, court trials, and social injustices, and testify to the evolving and comingling genres of literature and journalism. As first-hand witnesses to such scenes, the reporteresses became empathetic readers of social others, of those victims they encountered during the course of their reporting. As a result, when they reported back to their middle-class readership, these women attempted to sensitize their audience to the plight of others, stripping their readers of any existing indifference to social, racial, or gender differences, and turning the readers into secondary witnesses. Through this exclusive position, these women gained access to the public forum and were effectively able to shape their public despite their own limited political rights. Ultimately, through their corporeal attachment to the scene and the writing that resulted from their experiences, these journalists brought a new perspective to the writing and function of the daily news through the use of their own sensations; the mosaic of articles no longer presented a detached reading experience, but instead, the woman reporter offered readers stories that mediated connectedness.",France,2.213749,46.227638,18

French and Italian",French and Italian,"Jon R. Snyder, Jody Enders","In exploring the use of specific units of French farce in Tuscan comedy, this study aims to elucidate the ways in which a revised poetics of imitation within select experimental literary academies of the Renaissance not only favored the transgression of classical models but also triggered the explosive growth of hybrid genres. Finally, intercalation of French farce in Italian comedy sheds new light on the integration of Renaissance Italian theatrical culture in France at the end of the sixteenth century and raises issues of ""international relations"" in the field of theatrical studies. This study analyzes the experimental use of units of theater from the medieval French farce tradition in Pierantonio Stricca Legacci's Cilombrino (1518), Salvestro Cartaio's Il Travaglio (The Torment) (1552), and Antonfrancesco Grazzini's L'Arzigogolo (The Quibble) (c. 1580). It asks questions such as: Did French military presence in Italy or the substantial Italian population in France have a specific effect on the theatrical productions of the sixteenth century? For what reasons would the French farce have appealed to experimental Tuscan literary academies of the sixteenth century, and how would Tuscan playwrights have come into contact with the French genre? In what ways were units of farce appropriated as models of progressive theater for and by these academies? Finally, what role did politics play in the comedic creations of the sixteenth-century theater? Could only laughter speak the truth to power as embodied by the French monarchy and the Medici regime? How did this hybrid comic theater critique the conventions of humanist imitation? By examining the formal relationships between medieval French farce and Italian Renaissance comedy through close investigation of thematic and textual borrowings, as well as stagecraft, this study authenticates Tuscan comedy as a ""contact zone"" for transalpine intercultural exchange, involving both material exchanges (print, letters, staging features, audio-visual effects) and semiotic ones (symbols, themes, topoi). The French farce appealed to the experimental, avant-garde Tuscan dramatists of the sixteenth century as a model from which to appropriate a new kind of comic theater. Through the intercalation of Tuscan drama with the French farce, playwrights of the Congrega dei Rozzi in Siena and the Accademia degli Umidi in Florence created some of the first examples of hybrid genres of early modern theater; this intertextual phenomenon continued to gain popularity throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. By probing the connection between politics and the French farce, I show how inimitably suited this genre was to the needs of sixteenth-century Tuscan dramatists. This theatrical tradition allowed for the representation of key social tensions and contradictions that humanist comedy may otherwise have been unable to express theatrically without threatening to disrupt and undermine social stability. With an emphasis on interaction of theatrical forms, as well as a focus on the social, cultural, and historical factors that influenced these cultural productions, this dissertation offers a socio-semiotic reading of the construction of early modern European comedy, particularly in regard to humanism, imitation, and international cultural exchange.",France,2.213749,46.227638,18

History",History,Sharon A. Farmer,"The reign of Countess Mahaut of Artois (r. 1302-29) was marred by a series of economic, political, and environmental crises. Her unusually detailed financial accounts, which survive in impressive numbers, represent a unique opportunity to explore the interconnections between man and environment in a pre-modern world. I demonstrate that Mahaut and her retainers carefully managed, and even expanded, the estate of Hesdin and her other holdings as part of an ecological system. Further, I prove that rural parks were critical political tools used for more than the production of venison. Crucial elements in a social and political program, Mahaut's park shored up her political authority in the face of economic, environmental, and political disturbance. I supplement my analysis of Mahaut's financial accounts and political documents with a study of contemporary literature on the perception of gardens, parks, agriculture, as well as its many uses. These documents illustrate the pervasiveness of the natural resource management utilized on Mahaut's lands. I argue that parks were an aristocratic convention in northern Europe, and that they were integral elements in the aggressive fight for political dominance in the twilight years of the French feudal state. Mahaut and other high-ranking nobles maintained large, elaborate homes and pleasure parks during such crises because the manipulation of natural resources and landscapes affirmed political authority and funded the elite lifestyle as service-based relationships crumbled.

History",History,Sharon Farmer,"This dissertation explores the relationship between religious and racial persecution by examining Christian responses to converted Jews in thirteenth- and fourteenth-century northern France. By reconstructing attitudes of Christian intellectuals towards the possibility of Jewish conversion and exploring the socio-economic status and integration of converts, the dissertation clarifies the degree to which Judaism was believed to be inextricably linked to identity in medieval France. The dissertation draws on financial and administrative records to reconstruct the career trajectory of Philippe le Convers, a high-level royal agent and the godson of King Philip the Fair (r. 1285--1314). Other prominent medieval converts, such as Henry of Winchester in England, eventually faced limits to their ability to integrate into Christian society, but Philippe's status as a convert does not appear to have limited his career---or his influence at court---in any way. The dissertation also draws on evidence from property records, guild records, and tax assessments to examine the socio-economic status of other French converts, showing that a significant number of converts were well integrated into multiple sectors of the Parisian working world in the late thirteenth century. Parisian converts lived and worked in Christian neighborhoods throughout the city, and a significant number of Parisian converts practiced lucrative, prestigious trades. Some Parisian converts formed associations with prominent bourgeois by gaining access to Christian guilds or by marrying into well-placed bourgeois families. The dissertation also draws on narrative sources, such as chronicles and ecclesiastical visitation registers, in order to explore Christian chroniclers' perceptions of converted Jews from the late twelfth through the late fourteenth century, arguing that Christian chroniclers in France began to express heightened concerns about the status and trustworthiness of French converts, as a group, only after the expulsions of Jews from France in the early fourteenth century. France was one of the earliest countries to implement a national expulsion of Jews, and French policies played a major role in establishing the tone of anti-Jewish legislation throughout medieval Europe. Other studies have shown that the persecution of Jews intensified in northern Europe in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, and scholars have assumed that negative attitudes towards Jews must have applied to converts, as well. However, this dissertation argues that until the expulsions of the early fourteenth century, French converts were well integrated into Christian society and that evidence from a broad range of sources demonstrates a growing concern about the status and trustworthiness of converts in France only after the waves of expulsions in the fourteenth century.",France,2.213749,46.227638,18

History",History,Patricia Cline Cohen,"This dissertation examines the United States-based communitarian socialists known as the Fourierists as a piece of the larger international Fourierist movement, highlighting the numerous points of contact between Fourierists and their counterparts on each side of the Atlantic. My goal is to understand Fourierism as a multinational movement that sparked an international conversation among its members, which made it one of the most cosmopolitan of the reform movements to emerge from the social tumult in the 1840s. Its Janus-faced focus on the U.S. reform landscape and fixed connection with European Fourierists made Fourierism arguably the most dynamic reform movement of the nineteenth century. It is a story of connectivity among individuals who believed they possessed a new moral framework for remaking the world. The theories of the French social philosopher Charles Fourier also helped change the course of antebellum reform in the United States by introducing important themes and an entirely new vocabulary to the reform lexicon. The strength of the Fourierist press in the United States, especially the celebrated journal The Harbinger, highlights the movement's fingerprint on the course of American journalism. I will explore how and why this movement spread so far from the 1830s-1850s, and how these activists transcended national identity in order to realize the plan of perfecting the world's ills through the adoption of Fourier's experimental living arrangements. As a movement based on experiment, exchange, and collaboration, Fourierism intermingled freely with other mid-century reform movements including abolition, women's rights, free love, as well as workingmen's and other socialist movements. Traveling Fourierist leaders, the growth of Fourierist journalism, and the community of early Fourierists in New York City fostered complex identities in those at the heart of the movement. Their involvement in multiple causes demonstrates the international roots of mid-nineteenth-century reform. While adherents in each nation adapted Fourier's message to their own specific national context, the fluidity of the larger philosophy transcended borders, helping create an international reform identity in an age usually best known for a parochial nationalism. Using archival sources and published journals and periodicals from France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, this dissertation follows a chronological analysis of the movement's international layers. I examine the period from the movement's inception in the 1830s to its height in 1846, focusing on Fourierism's importation to the United States and its evolution from a cosmopolitan group of European and Francophone expatriates in New York City to a more Americanized version championed by Horace Greeley and Albert Brisbane with intentional appeal to workingmen. I also focus on the decline of Fourierism in the late 1840s, the pivotal year of the French Revolution of 1848, and the growth of the Free Love movement from Fourierism's ashes in the early 1850s. This dissertation compels scholars to look closer at the Fourierist movement as a case study in successfully changing the vocabulary of social reformers, bringing attention to the problems inherent within industrial capitalism, offering an inclusive approach to labor reform which included women's rights, and an alternative to the bourgeois home. Fourierism was at the center of a dialogue on gender norms and sexuality that would ultimately include members of the organized women's rights movement and advocates of the controversial free love movement. The Fourierist movement's communal ethos promised to improve the lives of women by ameliorating the drudgery of housework and providing shared child-rearing opportunities. Additionally, Charles Fourier's highly controversial theories on sexual liberation and marriage reform led some Fourierists to challenge reigning sexual mores. Studying the works of the Fourierists reveal new insights into the attitudes about gender and sexuality within the larger world of mid-nineteenth-century reform in the United States and Europe. Fourierism inspired a debate about gender, marriage, and religion that changed the language and tactics of mid-nineteenth-century reform.",France,2.213749,46.227638,18

I compare and contrast four different types of street demonstrations, their participants, and locales. Students were the first to protest, but I also analyze housewives' demonstrations, demonstrations against labor conscription (the releve and the STO), and patriotic protests on Armistice Day and Bastille Day. I track how French and German authorities sought to prevent street demonstrations and how well their efforts worked over time. I examine the difficulty in protesting under an authoritarian regime and whether demonstrations undermined public support for Vichy. Street demonstrations challenged the regime's legitimacy by questioning whether the French state could garner public support and maintain order. Collective spaces of cities offered French citizens a place to appropriate and give new meaning to everyday acts and rituals. In showing the impact of public dissent against an authoritarian state, I underscore the importance of the street as a space for opposition and contribute to histories that document France's long tradition of popular protest.",France,2.213749,46.227638,18

History of Art and Architecture",History of Art and Architecture,Bruce Robertson,"Paradox of Elitism: Vision, Risk, and Diplomacy in the European Career of Colonel John Trumbull (1756-1843) reconsiders Trumbull's life and works within the context of the eighteenth-century Federalist political ethos, American foreign policy, and nationalist trends of the Neoclassical academic style through the War of 1812. Articulating Trumbull as a Smithian ""economic man"" through five chapters, this study explores his artistic practice as the foundation and formulation, but also the failure, of a conservative Federalist aesthetic that was usurped when a more radical Democratic-Republicanism became the dominant cultural discourse in the first decades of the nineteenth century. Deeply faithful to Alexander Hamilton, Trumbull saw himself fulfilling the proper role of the public American artist, embracing the so-called 'invisible hand' of the market to facilitate his vision. Trumbull, like the Federalists, faded into unpopularity in the first decades of the nineteenth century, but given his prominence in the Federalist community, he, much more than the decidedly neutral Gilbert Stuart, ought to be credited as the inventor of Federalist vision---the politically-infused synthetic Neoclassicism that expressed the fair rule of the executive few over the following many. The dissertation's first two chapters reassess Trumbull's early life through his service in the Continental Army, and to his mysterious first trip to Europe, on which he took part in a secret plot with Benjamin Franklin, entered artistic study in London with Benjamin West, was arrested on suspicion of espionage, imprisoned, and eventually granted freedom. The third and fourth chapters follow Trumbull through the most imaginative and productive phase of his career, between 1784 and 1789, and explore the ways in which Trumbull merged the nationalizing styles of academic Neoclassicism in Great Britain and France, with continually evolving academic theories of art and his own rational, commercial view of the world that reduced the idea of history to variables of risk and profit. The product was Trumbull's own synthetic modes of historical painting and portraiture. The final chapter of this work examines the ways in which Trumbull, in his dual roles as an American diplomat and a picture-dealer in Europe in the 1790s, attempted to integrate risk management, United States foreign policy, and connoisseurship into his Federalist political enterprise.",France,2.213749,46.227638,18

History of Art and Architecture",History of Art and Architecture,Ann Bermingham,"Frederic Leighton is inextricably linked to the ""classical"" movement in late Victorian art. However, long before he was a classicist, Leighton's oeuvre was dominated by subjects from the late medieval/early Renaissance periods. The roots of Leighton's mature classicism are to be found in his so-called ""gothic"" works of this early period [c. 1846 (the date of his enrollment in the Stadelshes Kunstinstitut in Frankfurt, Germany) to 1864 (the date of his election as an Associate of the Royal Academy of Arts in London)], a period wherein he enjoyed a continued and direct exposure to the art of Italy, Germany, and France. A detailed accounting of Leighton's formative years and the profound effect exercised by his experience of the art of continental Europe is lacking. While art historians acknowledge that Leighton's work is much more complex than a simple reading might suggest, they invariably focus on his mature classicizing works. Leighton, however, viewed his works---be they from his ""gothic"" period or his ""classical"" period---as part of one continuum. Modern commentators routinely overlook this fact and divide his career into distinct periods. It is this compartmentalized view that this dissertation seeks to counter. Leighton's art is the product of a unique and highly selective process that would only have been conceivable in the context of his early cosmopolitan artistic experiences. An understanding of the circumstances that led to the formation of his early works elucidates the process whereby he developed a direct, transnational, and ultimately modern formulation of classicism centered on formal concerns. This dissertation examines Leighton's early career in the context of (1) his encounter with the art of the early Italian Renaissance and the art and artists of the German Nazarene movement; (2) the reception of his early works in Europe and America; (3) his encounter with French neoclassicism; and (4) its implications for his mature classicism.",France,2.213749,46.227638,18

Music",Music,Derek Katz,"My dissertation investigates Maurice Durufle (1902--1986) and Jean Langlais's (1907--1991) written and musical protestations of Vatican II's liturgical reforms. The composers' initial writings (1960--1969) communicate their determination to preserve chant and the organ, reflected in their music through the presence of a ""transcendent"" harmonic language. Characterized by intervallic symmetry, this language has historical associations with the otherworldly in fin-de-siecle art music. Beginning in the 1930s, French organist-composers known as the French Organ School applied the ""transcendent"" language to Gregorian chant melodies, Latin, and the organ to highlight vertical (human-to-God) dimensions of Catholic liturgy in their sacred music. The French Organ School consequently privileged the Church's identity as a transcendent institution, as existing outside space and time, through music. They then used it to combat what they perceived to be the desacralization of the liturgy after Vatican II. Nonetheless, Durufle and Langlais saw no improvement over the years, and their resolve eroded. Shown in their later writings (1970--1983), they surrendered to this state of affairs either by ironically re-contextualizing or by ceasing use of the ""transcendent"" harmony altogether. Durufle and Langlais expressed ideas similar to sociologists and theologians concerning the loss of transcendence, but they did so through musical language in addition to their writings. By analyzing their compositions, I rescript history of Catholic Church reform in the latter half of the twentieth century through musical language. I show that the music and letters of Durufle and Langlais capture themes that theologians and sociologists have articulated in their work on Vatican II and on twentieth-century Catholicism. As bishops implemented the reforms of the Council, their primary goal was to foster active participation among congregations. Theologians and sociologists have maintained that a consequence of the goal of participation was an over-privileging of relevance, understanding, and inculturation into a liturgy, historically characterized by symbolism, sensory experience, and counterculture. Anything characterized by the latter features---the ""otherness"" of Latin, chant, ritual actions, and the notion that the Church exists outside of time and space---became stigmatized after Vatican II. In short, the Church experienced a loss of transcendence. This shift in liturgical aesthetic consequently included the music that the French Organ School favored. In 1962, the Roman Catholic Church commenced with its twenty-first ecumenical council, Vatican II. Priests from around the world gathered to debate and decide on several issues with the goal of modernizing Catholicism while still maintaining its historical tradition. In addition to discussing abstract matters such as the nature and existence of God, the Council Fathers discussed practical issues, among them being the kind of music appropriate for ritual worship, the liturgy. Throughout Western history, the Catholic Church has cited in its documents Gregorian chant sung in Latin and the pipe organ as the musical expressions best suited for ritual worship. Vatican II's Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy, Sancrosanctum Concilium, drew from Church history and recognized chant and the organ's importance as previous conciliar documents and papal writings have done. Yet the Constitution also authorized the use of different styles, languages, and instruments. Once bishops, priests, and liturgists began implementing the reforms, however, folk tunes, jazz and rock styles sung exclusively in the vernacular largely replaced Latin and chant, while strumming guitars, percussion, and piano ensembles supplanted the organ. Amid this revolution, a number of French organist-composers critiqued the liturgical changes through the written word and music.",France,2.213749,46.227638,18

Philosophy",Philosophy,Christopher McMahon,"This dissertation focuses on the phenomenon of group agency and its moral and social implications. I begin by examining the history of collective intentionality and addressing some of the early criticisms. While I admit to many problems associated with original theories, I discuss more nuanced approaches in theories of intention that have relevance for a narrower conception group intentions (and thereby group agency), particularly theories developed by Peter French and Philip Pettit and Christian List. I then defend the basic features of these views against several current and likely critics. These are the main emphases of Chapters 1 and 2. Despite the plausibility of group agency, the concerns regarding group moral agency remain, which I address in Chapter 3. Group agents, particularly exemplified by the large modern business corporation, exert a tremendous amount of power over the direction of the economy and society, some of which are problematic and present key challenges for members of a polity. Without proper administrative structure, such group agents are unlikely to be responsive to moral reasons. I present and defend two key structural features of group agents that should help to make a group agent more likely to be responsive to moral reasons, elements of the grant theory of incorporation and Christopher McMahon's theory of managerial democracy. I finally explore the limitations of group moral agency in Chapter 4. While it is possible that a moral agent is capable of acting and having intentions in a way that is generally responsive to moral reasons, I point out that there are arguments against the view that a group moral agent can also be a group moral patient. If group agents are not moral patients, they cannot be accorded moral rights. The implications for this view are that corporations and other highly structured organizations have no moral right to engage in lobbying practices to affect government policy. I point out other avenues of rights for group agents, but they cannot serve as the basis for a right to lobby the government directly.",France,2.213749,46.227638,18

Religious Studies",Religious Studies,Thomas A. Carlson,"This dissertation explores the symbiotic relationship that has developed over the last century between two seemingly disparate discourses: Christian mystical theology and phenomenology. My principal concern is the origin and context of this relationship. How and why have we arrived to a situation where atheist philosophers have found helpful resources in the mystical traditions? More specifically, how and why did phenomenologists, beginning with Martin Heidegger, first engage mystical theology in order to formulate post-death-of-God conceptions of the human subject? Finally, how did Heidegger's earliest French readers---the forebearers of deconstruction and the so-called ""theological turn"" in French phenomenology---accomplish this task in response to his early analyses of the human and its relationship to the world? Answering these questions will help to explain how mysticism became a legitimate philosophical resource for those thinkers who not only do not believe in God, but who are openly antagonistic to such belief, at least in its metaphysical iterations. It will also help to explain how post-Heideggerian deconstructive philosophies became a helpful dialogue partner for those philosophers of religion interested in formulating non-metaphysical theologies by way of engagement with the mystical traditions. In sum, knowing the roots, contexts, and history of the unlikely intimacy of these two intellectual domains will enable thinkers on both sides of the conversation to understand more clearly the stakes involved in theological engagements with post-Heideggerian philosophy and philosophical openness to certain elements of mystical theology.",France,2.213749,46.227638,18

Theater Studies",Theater Studies,Simon Williams,"This dissertation interrogates the role of adaptation in creating and maintaining hegemonic cultural formations through a study of two tragedies by Euripides as they were adapted by neoclassical playwrights during the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in France and England. Adaptation studies, a relatively new field of academic inquiry, has thus far largely focused on defining adaptation in relation to more established studies of translation and intertextuality, and has primarily concentrated on cross-medium adaptations such as novels adapted into film. Taking these focuses as a point of departure, this study expands the field of adaptation studies by looking at adaptation not across medium, but across time and culture, through the examination of stage plays that were rewritten for public performance in early modern Western Europe hundreds of years after their initial performances in ancient Greece. In this context, with no change in medium, the uses of adaptation as a tool for disguising cultural difference are revealed, refocusing the scholarly discussion of adaptation from a search for definitions to an exploration of its implications for cultural studies. Exploring the ways in which new ideas about religion, gender, and morality made unadapted Greek tragedies unsuitable for public presentation on early modern stages, the case studies examine the alterations made in nine different adaptations of the two Iphigenia plays that have come down to us from ancient Athens. Looking at adaptations of adaptations (Gluck's operatic adaptation of Racine's retelling of Iphigenia in Aulis, for example) alongside direct adaptations of Greek tragedies, this study argues that local cultural conventions may be threatened by even very recent versions of a story, and that adaptation is leveraged accordingly in order to neutralize such ideological threats. In the process, this exploration traces the ways in which neoclassicism was interpreted and reinterpreted as it shifted times, locations, and genres: from the seventeenth century to the eighteenth, France to England, and spoken tragedy to opera.",France,2.213749,46.227638,18

Sociology",Sociology,John W. Mohr,"This study is an ethnography of the global. The Forum: A response to Paradigm Shift From State to Global Governance Field is based on what I perceive as an emerging pattern in global governance that is qualitatively different than past realities. The difference is signaled by what I perceive as an evolution of Pierre Bourdieu's theories on the state. Bourdieu's notion of the state field can be extended to the study of a global governance field wherein spheres of the state field have evolved together but at different rates and, at times, with differing objectives. These spheres include traditional governing institutions, the global economic sector, and global civil society. Traditional governance and the global economic sector were the first to begin their evolution from the level of the state to the global. Global civil society has emerged as a third actor within that field of global governance and has begun to act as mediator, and mitigator when needed, to the other actors. The World Economic Forum is one such actor, and one that has gained significant influence within the field of global governance. In 1971 the Forum began with a vision dedicated to bringing a more cooperative model to business based on the idea of multi-stakeholder environments. By the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Forum had established itself as a leading convener of the world's elite. Bringing together top CEOs from some of the world's most influential corporations with government and social leaders from across the globe, the Forum offered a space for these individuals to converge and discuss the necessary mutuality of their operations within shrinking global space. Controversial for many reasons, the Forum has still risen as convener, broker, knowledge producer and thereby policy generator for these global elite populations. This dissertation derives the majority of its data from an ethnographic study at their headquarter operations in Geneva, Switzerland. Based on 36 interviews with respondents ranging from a college intern to that of the founder and Chairman, as well as participant observation, and internal document analysis, this study seeks to understand how the Forum has evolved its internal culture from its inception and how this evolution has aided in organizational adaption trajectories that keep Forum services relevant to the global community that they serve.

History",History,Carol Lansing,"In this dissertation, I examine maritime predation conducted by and against the people of Genoa, Italy during the long twelfth century: 1100-1215 CE. Maritime predation, or piracy, was an endemic phenomenon in the medieval Mediterranean, but very little scholarship exists on the subject. In this study I demonstrate that rich documentation on virtually every aspect of maritime predation exist, both in narrative sources, and in notarial and diplomatic records housed in the Archivio di Stato in Genoa, and that maritime predation was a licit, and even celebrated activity in the period under investigation that involved a wide array of actors, both on the land and sea. I show that Maritime predation in twelfth-century Genoa was both an industry in its own right, and an integral part of the fabric of Genoese society. The importance of this activity to the cities that practiced and were victimized by it has been greatly underestimated by scholars. My study aims to rectify that, and to suggest new avenues for the study of maritime violence and predation. In Chapter One, I investigate the context of maritime predation in twelfth-century Genoa. I first describe the nature of the sources that are available for studying Genoese life in this period, and discuss both the interpretive limitations and possibilities that these sources offer. I also investigate the emergence, structure, and evolution of Genoa's communal government, which began to take shape at the beginning of the twelfth century. I argue that the precocious documentary culture emerged in Genoa, with its strong emphasis on record-keeping, served to meet the unique needs of a society heavily engaged in long-term collaborative investments and overseas trade. As a result, a wealth of documentation exists from this period, which makes the study of maritime predation, commerce, and many other aspects of daily life in the city possible. In Chapter Two, I investigate how normal commerce functioned in Genoa, and focus on the activities along Genoa's waterfront district, the Ripa Maris. I show that commerce was not just the activity of handful of travelling merchants, but that it involved men and women from all walks of life, working together as investors, harvesters, manufacturers, shop-owners, ship-builders and so forth. I also discuss the various regions with which the Genoese traded, and demonstrate that Genoa played a special role in commerce between various Muslim regions of the Mediterranean. Finally, I investigate both the Genoese participation in the Crusades, and their long-held hostility towards the neighboring Pisans, and argue that the Genoese sense of enmity was very different from what traditional narratives of faith relations in the medieval Mediterranean might lead one to expect. In Chapter Three, I discuss the historiography of piracy/maritime predation in the medieval Mediterranean, and examine exactly what kinds of documentation exist on the subject. I argue that it is actually inaccurate to use the term ""piracy"" in this context, as maritime predation was a licit activity, regulated by the government, and taxed by the archbishop, traditional commerce was. I also demonstrate that the vocabulary used in Genoese sources to discuss predation was the same terminology that was used for the terrestrial hunt. I finally investigate the kinds of ships that records indicate were used in maritime predation, and argue that the medieval Genoese boasted a far more varied arsenal of tools for predation than the scholarship has previously indicated. In Chapter Four, I examine a series of notarial contracts for the outfitting of predatory voyages, and break down the many steps that the process entailed. Through these contracts, I demonstrate that maritime predation was conducted as a highly-collaborative business venture that involved numerous investors, contractors, and other personnel, and that the contracts used to orchestrate these voyages were the same as those used to organize traditional commerce. I also identify many of the individuals who were engaged in maritime predation, and show that both members of the laboring classes and Genoa's elite frequently engaged in this activity, and that it was, in fact, members of the elite who were most often found organizing major predatory voyages. In Chapter Five, I discuss the targets of maritime predation, and the various methods that were used to try and prevent predation. I analyze the locations where maritime predation frequently took place, and argue that local knowledge and the ongoing collection of intelligence by sea captains were both integral to keeping ships safe. I also explore some of the methods that the commune used to prevent the capture of Genoese ships, and argue that just as Genoa's elites were often responsible for organizing and engaging in predation, they were also obliged to provide for the protection of merchant vessels. I also show that it is virtually impossible to draw a line between where defensive patrolling ended and offensive predation began. In Chapter Six, I discuss the tactics utilized by maritime predators, themselves, which is a topic that has not been addressed for this period. I demonstrate that predators had a wide variety of tactics at their disposal, and that elaborate networks existed for relaying information about the movement of ships. I discuss the identification of ships at sea through the use of flags and other signals, and the dangers of false identifications. I finally discuss a number of less common forms of maritime predation, including the commandeering of ships and cargoes from ports, which were considered predatory by contemporaries. Throughout this chapter, I demonstrate that a vast array of actors, working on both land and sea, were involved in maritime predation, and that it was a highly collaborative activity that linked people together, even as it divided them. In Chapter Seven, I conclude my investigation with an epilogue that analyzes changes in maritime predation around the turn of the thirteenth century. I demonstrate that the advent of a new kind of armed sailing ship revolutionized both normal commerce and maritime predation, resulting in a kind of medieval arms race at sea. I argue that this kind of advance shows that, while many aspects of seafaring may have remained constant throughout the Age of Sail, maritime predation was a highly contextual phenomenon that varied greatly depending on the political, social, and technological context. This, maritime predation it is a subject that must be studied carefully, and in context.",Genoa,8.946256,44.4056499,1

History of Art and Architecture",History of Art and Architecture,Edward B. Robertson,"This dissertation explores the emergence of the suntanned white body in the United States between the World Wars and its dual significance to modernism and the eugenics movement. The suntan serves as a revealing lens for examining the nexus of health, class, gender, and race in early American modernist art and visual culture. Rather paradoxically, as Euro-Americans were trying to preserve certain racial boundaries through eugenics, they also experimented with their own skin color in unprecedented ways. Yet through the popular practice of suntanning, Euro-Americans often transgressed the very racial color lines they sought to maintain. Suntanning---a physical transformation whose most visceral form is the visual---has yet to be critically examined as a subject of History of Art and Architecture. This study considers the nineteenth-century medical origins of suntanning as heliotherapy, modern notions of the skin as surface in the consumer culture of the 1920s and '30s, and the primitivist impulse of early American modernist artists in their appropriation of Native American cultural references as well as skin tone. I examine a broad spectrum of visual material ranging from travel, fashion, and cosmetic advertisements to Alfred Stieglitz's photographic portraits of a suntanned Georgia O'Keeffe ""playing Indian.""

History of Art and Architecture",History of Art and Architecture,Edward B. Robertson,"This dissertation explores the emergence of the suntanned white body in the United States between the World Wars and its dual significance to modernism and the eugenics movement. The suntan serves as a revealing lens for examining the nexus of health, class, gender, and race in early American modernist art and visual culture. Rather paradoxically, as Euro-Americans were trying to preserve certain racial boundaries through eugenics, they also experimented with their own skin color in unprecedented ways. Yet through the popular practice of suntanning, Euro-Americans often transgressed the very racial color lines they sought to maintain. Suntanning---a physical transformation whose most visceral form is the visual---has yet to be critically examined as a subject of History of Art and Architecture. This study considers the nineteenth-century medical origins of suntanning as heliotherapy, modern notions of the skin as surface in the consumer culture of the 1920s and '30s, and the primitivist impulse of early American modernist artists in their appropriation of Native American cultural references as well as skin tone. I examine a broad spectrum of visual material ranging from travel, fashion, and cosmetic advertisements to Alfred Stieglitz's photographic portraits of a suntanned Georgia O'Keeffe ""playing Indian."" I also assert that suntanning is a visual phenomenon in and of itself, a performative process by which skin changes color and texture and becomes a natural canvas.

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Susannah M. Porter,"The study herein describes a new genus and species of orthothecid hyolith and numerous echinoderm ossicles. The internal mold of the hyolith bears an apical ridge and is of uniform width, distinguishing it from other known hyoliths. Biological significance of its internal apical structure is unclear, though hypotheses proposed include a streamlining effect and presence of a terminal spine on the original shell. Inclusion of the supposed Circotheca stylus depicted in Dzik (1980: fig. 7) into this species expands the newly described hyolith's geographic range to Baltica and extends its temporal occurrence into the Late Cambrian. Some of the ossicles resemble echinoderm taxa (e.g., stylophorans and eocrinoids), but many ossicle morphologies share little to no similarities to known Cambrian echinoderms. Several fragmented ossicles bear phosphatic casts around their pores similar to Cantabria labyrinthica remains. Such results suggest that C. labyrinthica may represent echinoderm ossicles, not lobopodian plates as originally proposed by Clausen and Alvaro (2006).",Georgina Basin,-113.6126337,37.1352573,4

History",History,Harold Marcuse,"During this post-1945 phase, the group that would become known as the Danube Swabians employed various terms to identify themselves, while also having a separate terminology applied to them by the government of West Germany. These expellees did not develop a unitary group consciousness until the 1960s, when they set aside their post-Trianon identities in order to establish institutions that would preserve their cultural heritage. The first of these, the Haus der Donauschwaben in Sindelfingen, along with events such as the ""Tag der Donauschwaben"" and international fundraising efforts that encouraged a greater sense of cooperation between the separate groups catalyzed the development of a common identity. This identity remains firmly established today as the Danube Swabians continue to transfer their heritage to subsequent generations through a number of institutions. In analyzing the development of this collective consciousness, my dissertation restores the importance of self-perception among smaller displaced ethnic subgroups. In several waves during the eighteenth century about 150,000 German peasants embarked down the Danube River from Swabia to reclaim marshland recently reconquered from the Ottoman Turks by the Habsburg Monarchy. Nearly two centuries later their descendants fled and were expelled back into Austria and Germany in the aftermath of the Nazi occupation of that same region from 1941 to 1944. When they first arrived in Germany they self-identified as Yugoslavian-, Hungarian- and Romanian-Germans, according to the national states formed by the 1920 Treaty of Trianon governing the breakup of the Austro-Hungarian Empire. By 1967, however, they had adopted a unitary identity as Danube Swabians in their homeland of West Germany. This dissertation explores the evolution of this identity through four phases in an effort to understand how this group consciousness formed. The first phase began in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries when ""Swabian"" settlers from various German principalities traveled down the Danube and settled in Habsburg lands as imperial subjects. The second phase occurred after the post-World War I collapse of Austria-Hungary when status as a national minority conferred political advantages in the successor states of Yugoslavia, Hungary and Romania during the interwar years. The third phase witnessed the widespread adoption of National Socialism and the interruption of this national development via the flight and expulsion of the ethnic German populations across eastern Europe as a result of the Second World War. The main focus of this study examines the fourth phase as these three post-Trianon ethnic German subgroups recovered from their reverse migration to the Federal Republic.",Germany,10.451526,51.165691,11

Political Science",Political Science,Cynthia Kaplan,"The formation of the European Union creates a political condition that requires political to parties consider two levels of political competition: domestic politics and EU-level politics. For most parties EU-level politics are a secondary concern for political parties. As a result, EU policies have received little attention in domestic political competition. However, with deepening European integration, EU-level politics have emerged as a potential issue in domestic political competition. As part of their efforts to win votes and seats, parties must decide whether to develop a position on EU-level politics, or to remain focused on their domestic political platform. While the salience of EU-level politics is low across most European states, its importance does vary from country to country. This dissertation project attempts to answer several questions concerning the relationship between EU-level politics and domestic political competition. First, how do debates about the European Union manifest in domestic politics? Second, how does nationalism influence how EU policies are discussed in domestic politics? In order to explore these questions this dissertation expands on our understanding of how fringe parties use nationalism to influence the salience of EU-level policies in domestic political competition. It argues that differences in nationalism influence the types of EU policies that fringe, anti-EU parties can argue as a threat to the national group in a way to increase their votes. In turn, the efforts of these fringe parties influence what EU policies become salient in domestic political competition and also influence the attitudes of political parties toward EU polices. In order to develop this argument this dissertation first develops a method for determining types of nationalism for EU states ranging from inclusionary civic nationalism to exclusionary ethnic nationalism. It then argues that considering the EU as multiple issue areas as opposed to a single issue allows for a stronger understanding of party positions toward EU-level policies. In order to determine the salience of EU policies for political parties as well as their attitudes toward those policies this project moves beyond party manifesto data by collecting party statements posted on official party webpages in campaign period before the 2014 European Parliamentary elections for parties in Sweden, Germany, Estonia, and Poland. It then codes the documents for any statements concerning EU political, economic, or social policies. The dissertation then uses a descriptive and statistical analysis at both the state-level and party-level of analysis in order to test the influence that different types of national have on variation in the salience of EU-level policies across Europe. The results demonstrate that nationalism does influence the discussion of EU-level politics in domestic political competition. They also support evidence that there is party cohesion among parties in European party families concerning party attitudes toward EU political, economic, and social policies.",Germany,10.451526,51.165691,11

Geography",Geography,Joel Michaelsen,"This dissertation research examines impacts of weather and climate on vegetation productivity in geographically diverse areas of east Africa and the semi-arid Sahel. The focus of this research is how surface energy and water budgets respond to variations in rainfall and temperature. It asks the following questions: Where will warmer temperature pose a hazard to rainfed agriculture in the Sahel in the next 20 years? What environment and weather conditions led to above average surface temperature during the recent decade in east Africa? How have declines in rainfall since the 1980s impacted vegetation productivity and hydrology in Tanzania? The research incorporates a variety of earth observation data, including historical records from in situ, model-derived, and satellite-observed sources and projections from global climate models. A major contribution is the identification of specific areas, mainly in semi-arid climate zones, where increases in temperature and decreases to rainfall have large negative impacts on vegetation productivity. The research also presents new methods for evaluating land-atmosphere interactions in the context of hazards to vegetation. According to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, climate change will exacerbate current climate and non-climate stressors on agricultural systems in sub-Saharan Africa. This will adversely impact food security and the wellbeing of communities. Small-scale farmers grow more than 90 percent of the food produced in the region and many households depend on productive local growing conditions to support for their families. A better understanding of recent and near future climate constraints is important for identifying future food security risks and locally-appropriate adaptation strategies.",Germany,10.451526,51.165691,11

History of Art and Architecture",History of Art and Architecture,Ann Bermingham,"Frederic Leighton is inextricably linked to the ""classical"" movement in late Victorian art. However, long before he was a classicist, Leighton's oeuvre was dominated by subjects from the late medieval/early Renaissance periods. The roots of Leighton's mature classicism are to be found in his so-called ""gothic"" works of this early period [c. 1846 (the date of his enrollment in the Stadelshes Kunstinstitut in Frankfurt, Germany) to 1864 (the date of his election as an Associate of the Royal Academy of Arts in London)], a period wherein he enjoyed a continued and direct exposure to the art of Italy, Germany, and France. A detailed accounting of Leighton's formative years and the profound effect exercised by his experience of the art of continental Europe is lacking. While art historians acknowledge that Leighton's work is much more complex than a simple reading might suggest, they invariably focus on his mature classicizing works. Leighton, however, viewed his works---be they from his ""gothic"" period or his ""classical"" period---as part of one continuum. Modern commentators routinely overlook this fact and divide his career into distinct periods. It is this compartmentalized view that this dissertation seeks to counter. Leighton's art is the product of a unique and highly selective process that would only have been conceivable in the context of his early cosmopolitan artistic experiences. An understanding of the circumstances that led to the formation of his early works elucidates the process whereby he developed a direct, transnational, and ultimately modern formulation of classicism centered on formal concerns. This dissertation examines Leighton's early career in the context of (1) his encounter with the art of the early Italian Renaissance and the art and artists of the German Nazarene movement; (2) the reception of his early works in Europe and America; (3) his encounter with French neoclassicism; and (4) its implications for his mature classicism.",Germany,10.451526,51.165691,11

Music",Music,Benjamin Brecher,"This study finds that early songs with recitative can and should be performed observing the rhythm of speech over written note values when the accompaniment allows. However, increasingly after 1820, Schubert's Lieder became rhythmically more exact, requiring disciplined rhythmic execution with sparing rubato. This evolution is an example of Schubert's expansion and eventual distillation of Lieder into a dynamic but precise expressive medium, which established the Lied as a genre of worth for ""serious"" composers. This requires that Schubert's Liedrezitativ first be defined as an interpretive tool, including its dramatic and structural applications as well as its technical construction. In the opening chapter, specific Schubert Lied passages are compared with his compositional models and influences from opera, song, and the secular cantata. The second chapter explores Schubert's development and transcendence of Liedrezitativ, beginning with a brief explanation of Joakim Kramarz's work, Das Rezitativ im Liedschaffen des Schuberts. Kramarz uses an exhaustive analysis of Schubert's recitative cadential figures to demonstrate Schubert's evolution away from the techniques of Salieri and Gluck, but Kramarz's work remains largely musicological. The work at hand aims to expand Kramarz's findings, through analysis of Schubert's revisions to his own works and the construction of his late Liedrezitativ, and to discuss the implications of Schubert's evolution of style for modern performers. The third chapter explores the most effective and appropriate performance of Schubert's Lieder in consultation with treatises from the turn of the nineteenth century, first-hand accounts, Schubert's own words, the legacy of performance tradition embodied in today's leading Schubert performers, and the compositions themselves. This work traces Schubert's use of recitative in Lieder from its inception in his first song D5 Hagars Klage , through his eventual incorporation and transcendence of recitative. It discusses the implications of this evolution both in performance and the development of the German Lied..",Germany,10.451526,51.165691,11

Music",Music,Helen Callus,"Since the viola attained soloist status in the early to mid 20 th Century, violists have been faced with the never-ending task of matching the performance standards of their more agile violin brethren. Much of the violinist's technical facility comes from their study of pre-twentieth century musical offerings; yet, the development of the viola student is handicapped by the lack of original viola repertoire from that time. More repertoire of this ilk needs to be made available as transcriptions to violists. Moreover, violists should be the ones creating these transcriptions because they know best the intricacies of the instrument. This may seem a daunting task since not all violists are experienced in composing or transcribing. Further, no standard transcribing process exists in print. The aim of this document is to purpose a set of general guidelines for transcribing music from the violin to the viola, while isolating the various problems that can occur during that process. The Two Sonatas for Violin and Piano, as well as the Three Solo Sonatas for Violin of German composer, August Halm (1869--1929), will serve as the case study from which to build this method. While Halm is admittedly a Modern era composer, his compositional style leans more heavily on Bach, Beethoven, and Bruckner than his contemporaries.

Weeks, David Lopez-Carr","Health in the developing world is becoming particularly complex due to disparate economic and environmental contexts residing in close spatial proximity, each paving the way for widely different environmental health hazards resulting in acute and chronic illness. In navigating this increasingly heterogeneous landscape, children in Accra, Ghana face multiple types of environmental health hazards as they travel from home, to school, to friends' houses, and to visit family. A child-in-home, or even child-in-neighborhood model of third world urban health hazards cannot account for the complexity of hazards and health threats faced by children on a daily basis. Yet children in Accra, particularly as they move out of their especially vulnerable early years, manage to navigate and mitigate health hazards. Little is known about how children perceive environmental health hazards: their spatially situated knowledge of hazards within daily environments may lead to a better understanding of how space and place drive human-environment health interactions. Furthermore, numerous studies have demonstrated that children in both the developed and developing world are acting with increased agency regarding health. This research proposes to advance the health geography, environmental health, and health education literature by working with children from three diverse contextual backgrounds in a developing third world city to examine verbal, visual, and spatial perceptions of health and environmental health hazards. The dissertation does this by establishing baseline differences of children and adult's perceptions of children's health, testing child-friendly visual methods of assessing health knowledge, and developing a novel method of assessing spatial patterns of health perceptions through GPS and photography. Results indicate that children in Accra have distinct, and often varying, perceptions of health when compared to adults and across socioeconomic groups. Photographic methods that contextualize health are good measures of health knowledge and perceptions. Furthermore, placing health perceptions in space as children move through the environment sheds light on spatial properties of health perceptions, such as health related landmarks, and regional categorization of spaces into healthy and unhealthy places.",Ghana,-1.023194,7.946527,5

Geography, Joint Program SDSU","Geography, Joint Program SDSU",John R. Weeks,"Intraurban differentials in safe drinking water in developing cities have been exacerbated by rapid population growth that exceeds expansion of local water infrastructure. In Accra, Ghana, municipal water is rationed to meet demand, and the gap in water services is increasingly being filled by private water vendors selling packaged ""sachet"" water. Private sector sale of sachet water has grown to fill an important gap in household water security, and consumption of sachet water has been on the rise in West Africa over the last decade. Sachets extend drinking water coverage deeper into low-income areas and alleviate the need for safe water storage. This potentially introduces a health benefit over stored tap water, but at an additional cost both financially and environmentally. The long-term implications of these changing consumption patterns remain unclear. This work begins by reviewing recent shifts in drinking water sources from recent Ghana Demographic and Health Surveys, as well as the history, economics, quality, and regulation of sachet water in Ghana's Accra-Tema Metropolitan Area. It proceeds to explore correlates of using sachets as the primary drinking water source for two large samples of women drawn from separate household surveys in Accra, and investigates links between sachet water and reported diarrhea episodes in a subset of children under five. Within Accra's slums, neighborhood water rationing and lower socioeconomic status tend to increase a household's likelihood of buying sachet water, and sachet customers tend to be the poorest of the poor. Sachet use is also associated with higher levels of self-reported overall health in women, and lower likelihood of diarrhea in children. More broadly, after controlling for all socioeconomic groups in Accra, sachet use is associated with younger age, lower overall health, and neighborhood water rationing. Sachet water consumption also seems to have transitioned from an initial luxury good of the rich to a widespread phenomenon of the urban poor between 2008 and 2010. Given the pros and cons of sachet water, a more holistic understanding of the drinking water landscape is necessary for municipal planning and sustainable drinking water provision.",Ghana,-1.023194,7.946527,5

Religious Studies",Religious Studies,Ines Talamantez,"The dissertation is an anthropological study utilizing oral narrative, archival history, and sociological methods to examine the question of how the Anlo-Ewe people experience the divine and how these perceived human-divine relations affect 1) formation of identity, 2) community relationships, and 3) vocational selection and decision-making processes. The secondary question of the study explores the effects of globalization, technological advancement, and Christianization on 'traditional' Anlo-Ewe practices and community dynamics in southeastern Ghana. How the Anlo-Ewe spirit world influences, engages, and interconnects its practitioners is determined through examining the functions and structure of the Anlo-Ewe cosmological order; identifying the religio-social role of artists, mediums, diviners, and priestesses as spirit messengers; and interpreting the process and outcome of practitioners experiencing vodu, or divinity, individually and communally. Research was compiled from: court records, colonial documents, first-hand narratives and secondary resources; experiential data gathered from interviews with Christian and Anlo-Ewe Vodu practitioners; attendance at private initiation and community rites, public ceremonies, religious services, and funerals; and living at family compounds in Klikor, Nogokpo and Denu and at a shrine for priestesses-in-training in Ghana's Ketu South District. Findings show that indigenous practices are decreasing as western forms of Christian-influenced education are becoming more readily prescribed and available to school-age children. Anlo-Ewe services, community rites, and priestly schedules are being amended to match increasing global material access, technological advancement, and community expectations of the shifting perspectives of time. Constructions of identity, vocational and marital selection, and community relationships are likewise struggling between models of intra-community, or extended familial responsibility, and models based on the nuclear family or self-interest as primary, often shifting from localized expectations of economic and social interrelationship to a more protracted conception of personhood involving individualization, accusations of witchcraft, and capitalist models of success. The Vodu pantheon has adapted and transformed to match social experience: times of community upheaval invite greater numbers of personalized spirits adopted for individual means above collective purposes. Experiential elements of bodily engagement with divinity (vodu), via dreams, divination, possession, community ceremony and initiation, remain vital to the stability of local community practices and perceptions of social cohesiveness.",Ghana,-1.023194,7.946527,5

Seafloor methane seep ecosystems might represent key sources for both ancient and modern biological diversification. The potential transfer of energy and genetic information among seep microbiota remains understudied and is the focus of this dissertation. Seep organisms that obtain energy via hydrocarbon oxidation establish a diverse benthic community where microbial assemblages exhibit myriad trophic interactions. At a shallow hydrocarbon seep, offshore Goleta, CA, benthic microbial mats grow in close proximity to actively venting gas. Bacterial methanotrophs and secondary consumers of methane-derived carbon were identified in the microbial mats using a combination of genetic assays and stable isotope tracking under both natural and enrichment conditions. Direct methane consumption was linked to the family Methylococcaceae, while secondary consumers and chemoautotrophic bacteria were inferred by taxonomic affiliations. Chemosynthetic microbial communities form the foundation for deep methane seep ecosystems in the Santa Monica Basin, offshore Los Angeles, CA. Here, diverse viral lifestyles from seafloor and pelagic environments were examined through a metagenomic lens. A bacteriophage genome from seep sediments was found to encode a mechanism for self-directed protein evolution, known as a diversity generating retroelement. Similar retroelement patterns of targeted mutagenesis were identified in public sequences from a coastal methane seep, offshore Norway and from an estuarine environment at the Galapagos Islands. Viral genomes were examined from seawater near a Santa Monica Basin cold seep. Pelagic viral genomes (ssDNA) were differentiated from assembled metagenomic sequences, including bacteriophage and eukaryotic viruses.

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Syee Weldeab,"Resolving abrupt Indian summer monsoon (ISM) changes in the past is critical to understanding major forces that modulate Indian summer monsoon variability. Mixed layer dwelling planktonic foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber (white) from core material retrieved from the northern Bay of Bengal, tropical Indian Ocean, were used to create a record of Ba/Ca, Mg/Ca, and delta 18O variations. Time-series of Ba/Ca-based sea surface salinity (SSS), delta 18O of sea water, and Mg/Ca-based sea surface temperature are used to investigate millennial-scale variability of the ISM and its relationship to Bay of Bengal sea surface temperature through the last glacial (95--25 kyr BP). The proxy records indicate that the ISM responded sensitively to rapid changes in oceanic and atmospheric perturbation. Intensification of ISM, as indicated by a decrease in runoff-induced SSS, corresponds to episodes of warm air temperature over Greenland, known as Dangaard-Oeschger (DO) interstadials. Concomitant to Heinrich events our record indicates an abrupt weakening of ISM. A weak correlation between Ba/Ca-based SSS and Mg/Ca-based sea surface temperature indicates a decoupling between SST and Indian summer monsoon precipitation during millennial-scale events. Divergences in the timing, pace, and magnitude of Ba/Ca-based SSS and delta18Olocal seawater (temperature and ice volumes components removed) reveals local delta 18O changes related to ISM variability are likely caused by many factors. Furthermore, the record of delta18Oresidual that has been established by removing the ice volume, temperature, and salinity components from foraminiferal delta18O, suggests that decline in monsoon strength was accompanied by an increase in the delta18 O of precipitation during northern high-latitude stadials. Dissimilarity between the Ba/Ca-based SSS and delta18Olocal seawater records as well as significant delta18Oresidual variability suggest the imprint of millennial-scale ISM changes on the delta18O record may be more complicated than previously thought. An enrichment of delta18Oresidual is present during Heinrich events. One possible explanation for this observation is that concomitant to the decline in monsoon precipitation the isotope composition of precipitation was significantly enriched, most likely suggesting changes in source and pathway of the moisture. Therefore, reconstruction of past ISM changes solely on basis of delta18O records may lead to inaccurate assessment of precipitation change. Overall, the record from the northern Bay of Bengal indicates that the ISM responds very sensitively to changes in millennial-scale northern high-latitude temperature and ice sheet instability.",Greenland,-42.604303,71.706936,1

French",French,Eric Prieto,"This work delineates the unique role theatre plays in the establishment of Martinican and Guadeloupian cultural and national identity independent from (although integrated with) the dominant French culture of their former colonizers. As French overseas departments, both Martinique's and Guadeloupe's public school system has been imported from France and thus imposes an alienating French emphasis on West Indian consciousness and identity. Yet theatre offers a new place for cultural education because it can instill pride, consciousness and identity in a localized form particular to Martinique and Guadeloupe. This important educational function is especially notable in the plays analyzed here, which are virtually absent from the critical literature on the French Caribbean, yet clearly merit a closer look. I examine a corpus of over twenty French West Indian plays. I consider these plays as cultural manifestations of what Martinicans and Guadeloupians value and disparage. I look at this theatre also as a national theatre wherein a narrative of the nation is fabricated and affirmed publically. I study Martinicans and Guadeloupians through their theatrical cultural manifestations which themselves focus on historical and contemporary events. Thus my analysis contributes cultural and historical depth to the rapidly evolving field of French Caribbean theatre criticism. My dissertation examines works, 1960-present, by Aime Cesaire, Edouard Glissant, Daniel Boukman, Ina Cesaire, Rene Louise and Patrick Chamoiseau, to name a few. One can discern in these works an independent cultural identity, which can be illuminated by the lens of ""auto-ethnography."" This term refers to Glissant and Chamoiseau's interest in studying and transcribing their own cultures with both the critical eye of an outside observer and the deep understanding of a native informant. Although the other authors did not self-identify as auto-ethnographers, I argue that one can apply this concept more broadly. The early 1960s were a crucial time when many colonies were fighting for and gaining independence. Although not directly engaged in anti-colonial struggles, Martinicans and Gaudeloupians nevertheless participated in independence movements and theatre was a significant arena for articulating these issues. Prior to this moment, imitation and reproduction of French theatre, culture, and society reigned; from the 1960s onward, playwrights focused on the expression and resuscitation of local history and culture. To facilitate this expression, many writers turned toward popular movements such as Negritude, Antillanite, and Creolite, enabling a cultural education and affirming an identity particular to both Martinique and Guadeloupe.",Guadeloupe,-61.551,16.265,1

Focusing on oral history interviews, literary analysis, and cemetery and grave markers as texts, the last chapter looks at AIDS and HIV, especially in the 1980s and nineties, and how its history is remembered and erased in the city. This project is a cartography of Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, Queer Latino/a Los Angeles, mapping alternative spaces-physical, ephemeral and performative- of queer Latina/o life in Los Angeles. This interdisciplinary project uses a feminist and queer of color approach to the analysis of Latina/o urban space, situating US Third World feminists and the narrators in my research as critical geographers and social semioticians. In the first chapter I argue that LGBTQ or ""queer"" brown LA, as a borderlands space, is a transnational site of gendered, raced and sexed processes and as such has experienced epistemological, curricular, representational and physical, omissions and erasures. Some of us have literally been removed. Stemming from legacies of colonialism, nationalisms and neo-liberalism, queer transnational Latina/o LA has been rendered invisible by homonationalist, racist, mainstream narratives that represent ""gay LA"" as white, middle class, and male.",Guatemala,-90.230759,15.783471,4

Geography",Geography,David L. Lopez-Carr,"This study investigates land cover change and land ownership turnover in an area that is a priority conservation zone, the Sierra del Lacandon National Park (SLNP), Peten, Guatemala. Migration to Peten since the 1950s has eliminated 60% of Peten's forests. Migration to the SLNP peaked in the 1990s and population growth continues. This study analyzes panel-data consisting of household interviews conducted with farmers living in the SLNP or its buffer zone in 1998 and 2009. I examined household survey data previously collected during interviews conducted in 1998 with 247 subsistence farmers in eight communities. In 2009 I reinterviewed the same households when present. Additionally, I interviewed the new owners of land that had belonged to the 1998 interviewees, and a cross-sectional sample of 213 randomly selected households. Surveys were primarily quantitative, with some open-ended qualitative questions. I ran continuous regressions examining changes in land cover for households who remained in the area between the two dates. I also ran logistic regressions examining which 1998 landholding households had sold their land by 2009. The overall trend is towards deintensification of agriculture. On average, households crop larger areas of higher value crops and less maize, but these changes have not kept pace with the expansion of pasture. The area is simultaneously experiencing farm parcel consolidation and splintering. Half of the landowning households in 1998 sold their land by 2009, some to large landholders. The most commonly cited reason for a household to sell its land is for payments related to a medical emergency or debt. Early adopters of cattle and higher value crops were less likely to have sold their land by 2009. As in much of the lowland tropics of Latin America, pasture dominates the landscape. These findings illustrate that in areas of weak grain and produce markets, many households with the means to produce beyond basic subsistence will turn to cattle. In conservation areas of Latin America, park administrators would be advised to invest in developing land use alternatives to cattle, such as non-timber forest products.",Guatemala,-90.230759,15.783471,4

Global and International Studies",Global and International Studies,Jan Nederveen Pieterse,"This project is about discovering how some groups are working to build participatory governance as an alternative to the established processes that produce their marginalization. Governance refers to the decision-making processes at work in a given aggregate of people or territory, along with the more material outcomes of those processes, and affects social, political, economic, and cultural spheres. Therefore, changing governance has the potential to create comprehensive, systemic changes within those aggregates of people or territory, particularly for those who have been excluded from the benefits or even protection of existing processes. With this in mind, this project seeks to explore participatory governance as one possible avenue for systemic change. The following questions guide this exploration: What is participatory governance? Can it be an effective way for marginalized peoples to create alternative systems and structures to the ones that currently oppress them? By considering two living cases of participatory governance, in Mexico and Venezuela, this paper argues that participatory governance processes better serve the immediate needs of marginalized peoples and also empower them to create alternative, emancipatory systems by changing the priorities of governance through collective decision making. These questions are explored through the writings of those who are directly impacted by the participatory processes investigated in this piece, from both Mexico and Venezuela, as well as those who may have a different kind of stake in this debate, as outside observers, and sometimes as activists in their own contexts. Following this more theoretical exploration are two in-depth case studies of living participatory governance processes: in Zapatista communities in Chiapas, a Mexican state on the border with Guatemala; and in Chavista-governed Venezuela, where twenty-first century socialism has become the official guiding governance policy. These chapters articulate the governance structures in each of the respective national contexts, and explore the products of these governance processes surrounding education, health, and equitable development, since our measure of effective governance is often tied to the collective goods it is able to provide rather than simple sets of rules and regulations. Exploring these reformulations will ideally provide insight into alternative approaches to global governance processes currently overrun by certain exclusive and unsustainable mechanisms and hegemonies. Seeking alternatives is important because we live on a planet with finite resources, a growing population with disparate levels of consumption, and a changing climate. Conflict over arable land, clean water, and other valuable resources only promises to increase in the future, as communities face desertification or soil collapse, sea level rise, and regional conflict. Decreased conflict and increased equitability seem unlikely within the current world structure, so seeking alternative forms of governance, ways of living together, and resource management, takes on a new urgency. We must not wait until it is too late.",Guatemala,-90.230759,15.783471,4

Sociology",Sociology,"William I. Robinson, Juan-Vicente Palerm","This dissertation examines the interplay between processes of globalization and transnational migration and their impact at the micro level in the understudied area of gendered household economic strategies in both sending and receiving communities. Drawing on a multi-sited ethnography study which employed a two-phase mixed methods approach, I analyzed migration histories, occupational mobility, migration dispersion in the U.S., and household economic strategies, in two transnational communities: 1) Acayahualco, Guerrero Mexico and Santa Barbara, CA and 2) Mayanalan, Guerrero Mexico and Wilmington, DE. To ascertain key socio-demographic features of the populations under study, I developed a 162-item survey that I administered to 90 households in the sending communities of Guerrero, Mexico. The survey results were both complemented and challenged by my multi-sited ethnographic research comprising 50 in-depth interviews, along with participant observation in the sending and receiving communities. This study offers two contributions to sociology: in the one hand it examines the ways in which globalization takes place at the local level, specifically in the social context of international migration. By undertaking this type of dialectic analysis of the global and the local, this study sheds light on the individual's response capabilities and, more importantly, on their agency power in the face of global processes. This proactive agency on the part of the transnational migrant families becomes evident as they are observed looking constantly for ways to ""stretch their limited resources"" to cover expenses by relying on their unlimited resourcefulness. In this context, international migration should not be viewed simply as a survival strategy for peasant families, but, as a mechanism of reaction and resistance against global capitalism barriers. On the other hand, I demonstrated throughout this work, the social phenomenon of international migration in these two communities, and within their domestic units, is the result of an accumulative and uninterrupted process that has been shaped by a vast number of learning experiences, social and cultural exchanges, and innovative and resourceful practices to cope with the challenges of becoming transnational. The transnational perspective allows us to underscore how, in spite of being physically separated by great distances, the development of household economic strategies by migrants and their families are deeply linked. This transnational linkage allows migrants and their families in their communities of origins to cope with the challenges of a globalized economy that has been detrimental to their living conditions. In this sense, the results of my study counter the view that sees migrants and their families in their communities of origin as puppets controlled by forces beyond their own control. Rather, this study emphasizes how migrants and their families with hard-working ethics look for opportunities to improve their socioeconomic circumstances and enhance their living conditions.",Guerrero Mexico,-99.5450974,17.4391926,1

Geography",Geography,Michael F. Goodchild,"Guinea worm (Dracunculiasis) is a two-host, nematode parasite that is currently the focus of an international eradication effort. The remaining few of these parasites live in sub-Saharan and Sahelian Africa in the countries of Chad, Ethiopia, Mali, and South Sudan. By the end of 2010 there were fewer than 1,800 cases of Guinea worm reported worldwide, an astonishing decrease from the estimated 3.5 million reported cases in 1980 when the international eradication effort began. There is no vaccine or preventative medicine to inoculate against the parasite and the eradication effort has focused on an educational program, teaching those at risk how to prevent infection. Through education and community programs to improve access to clean and safe drinking water, it is hoped that the parasite will have been eliminated from the waters worldwide in the near future. The goal of this research is to understand how Guinea worm has reemerged in regions where it had once been eliminated. A current hurdle to the eradication effort is to supervise the regions where Guinea worm once existed to ensure there is no reemergence. There have been several incidents of reemergence in the past and the work for this dissertation examines historical data on Guinea worm reemergence to better understand the process and identify the most suitable methods for locating regions at risk for reemergence. Results of this analysis show that specific transportation networks and medical facilities may play a role in determining the spread of Guinea worm as it reestablishes itself in a region. This work reiterates that both disease transmission and species abundance are fundamentally spatial processes and that the incorporation of spatial approaches provides new insights into the nature of Guinea worm reemergence.

Linguistics",Linguistics,Marianne Mithun,"In its traditional definition, switch-reference refers to systems where subject co-reference and disjoint reference across clause boundaries are marked. Found in a wide variety of languages, it is especially prevalent in languages of the Trans-New Guinea family. A closer look at switch-reference constructions in connected speech suggests that the traditional understanding of the primary function of switch-reference might not be accurate. In this study, I rely on data from four traditional Hua folk tales which total approximately thirty minutes. I focus on instances of unexpected switch-reference marking in order to elucidate what principles underlie the use of so-called aberrant forms. I discuss both the morphosyntactic and prosodic patterning in order to advance the claim that switch-reference is based on particular intraclausal relationships within coordinate clause chains. The morphosyntax of unexpected switch-reference marking involves the interaction between two sets of constructions inherent in the morphology of coordinate medial verbs. One set is used to signal either continuity between the subparts of a single coherent event, or discontinuity between different events. In the other set, a causal interpretation between the actions represented by two clauses is either ruled out or made explicit. The prosodic patterning of these constructions is equally important. Single clauses can occur in separate intonation units when the subparts of an event represent separate actions. Alternatively, both clauses in the construction can occur in a single intonation unit to reflect the cohesiveness of the actions in terms of eventhood. What emerges from these observations is that the primary function of the morphosyntax of switch-reference is to mark dependency relations between coordinate clauses. The prosody of switch-reference interacts with and sometimes reinforces the morphosyntactic coding by signaling different degrees of continuity and discontinuity at various levels in the event structure of discourse. The claim that Hua switch-reference is fundamentally based on the interplay between dependency relations and event structure has far-reaching consequences for our broader understanding of the typology of clause combining, and suggests a need for a closer look at the cross-linguistic interactions between the morphosyntax and prosody of switch-reference.",Guinea,-9.696645,9.945587,3

Sociology",Sociology,Kum-Kum Bhavnani,"My doctoral dissertation examines how rising seas and a recently renewed interest in the construction of seawalls illustrate a form of development that involves substantial labor, financing, and materials in addition to hidden social and environmental costs. More generally, the research looks at the moving borders of the sea driven by the complex dynamics of anthropogenic climate change in which twenty-five million to one billion people will be affected by the year 2050. I draw upon theoretical approaches that consider climate-related issues to be macro-social processes involving global and international relations as well as matters of lived experience involving people in contexts where material and cultural histories shape climate change resiliency. Using the methods of global ethnography, I address the problem of coastal vulnerability by focusing on the cultural and social dynamics of coastal development and sea change in Guyana, The Maldives, Venice and the Netherlands, highlighting issues that emerge in places where seawalls are already important fixtures in the landscape. Analysis across these sites reveals how the threat of rising seas involves multiple axes of inequality formed within the contexts of colonialism, development, and globalization over the past one hundred years. Seawalls and other coastal structures embody culturally ingrained meanings, physical demands, and financial investments that continue to shape the experiences of those who live behind them. Data was gathered from April 2012 to April 2014 in Venice, the Netherlands, Guyana and the Maldives, and included sixty-two semi-structured interviews and nine focus groups, touching upon the lived experiences of 120 people. Findings illustrate the tensions and contradictions that ground seawall development. In Guyana, sand bags and rip-rap structures line the coast in contrast to the state of the art concrete barriers found in Venice, the Netherlands, and the United States. Poor coastal villages have few options as they invest time and hope in the restoration of mangroves forests, a process that has been met with many obstacles and unexpected sacrifices. In the Maldives, one-third of the population lives on a walled island without beaches, while tourists enjoy holidays on over two hundred island resorts nearby. As seawalls become measures of last resort in the struggle to hold the line, the existing narratives of the ""sinking island"" and ""climate change refugee"" fail to capture the dynamic inequalities that exist within and between places. This study shows the need to offer different conceptualizations of rising seas in public discourses, based on an analysis of seawalls and what the people who live in and around them say as they speak out.",Guyana,-58.93018,4.860416,1

I also ask: How have US-based women of color feminist and queer of color theory impacted Filipino nationalist frameworks in the US? How do they also remain at odds with one another? I interviewed 21 NYC-based activists and organizers involved in anti-imperialist Filipino organizations the summer of 2012. I also used participant observation as an active member of study groups, educational workshops, and a town forum. My central framework explores conflict as contradiction using Mao Tse-tung's ""On Contradiction"" and the Haitian concepts of balans and konesans. In doing so, I examine how hard-lined leadership has impeded dialogue. I also interrogate how sexism, transphobia, masculinist organizing structures, and neoliberalism impact women, trans, queer, disabled, working class, and undocumented organizers---particularly those with overlapping identities of marginalization. ""The Movement's"" familial dynamic, combined with the value of utang na loob, creates hierarchies that cause some members to feel both silenced and guilty. I name these feelings as indicators of invisible emotional labor ""for the sake of the movement"" that lead many members to eventually leave their organizations. Their departures raise questions of sustainability. Lastly, I ask how the Fil-Am Left can draw strength from its familial dynamic but still address hierarchical issues that mirror societal hierarchies of oppression. Applying work by Patricia Hill Collins, Audre Lorde, and other women of color, along with feminist grounded theory and sociological movement theory, I highlight three strategies that New York City based Filipino organizations have taken within the past ten years. I argue that organizations have recognized problems with sustainability and are creating their own interventions as theory-producers. Organizers' relationships to the National Democratic movement in the Philippines shape both the creation of interventions and how they respond to new ideas.

Sociology",Sociology,William I. Robinson,"As a new epoch in the history of world capitalism, global capitalism is shaping every region of the planet. One of these regions is the Caribbean, among the first outside of Europe to be integrated into world capitalism through colonialism five centuries ago. In recent decades, as the Caribbean's population has become entwined with global networks of production and finance in extremely unequal ways, scholars have begun to document shifting social patterns. While Caribbean societies throughout their history have exhibited many differences and continuities, the sweeping changes characteristic of globalization compel us to examine the region's changing political economy. With much of the Caribbean's population based in the Greater Antilles island chain (containing Cuba, the Dominican Republic, Haiti, Jamaica, and Puerto Rico), this geographic area will be referred to most often in my research. As many studies have been done on contemporary Puerto Rico (as an associated part of the U.S.) and on socialist Cuba, the case studies of this dissertation will focus on Jamaica, Haiti, and the Dominican Republic. In looking at these three countries, case studies will examine how their national economies have fragmented and become penetrated by global chains of accumulation. I will look at this specifically through the context of major global industries (cruise ship tourism, mining, export processing, and the role of migration and reverse flow of remittances). My introductory chapter reviews, synthesizes, and interprets existing sources and accounts on the development of capitalism in the Caribbean. Especially useful are a number of scholarly studies on the shifting modes of production in the Caribbean, from slave labor to wage labor and from European colonial mercantilism up to industrializing monopoly capitalism and into capitalist globalization albeit with the U.S. as the major hegemonic power in the region. Such studies are useful in helping to understand the history of social formation in the region. I also have read reports and data gathered by key political and economic forums active in the Caribbean and specifically with regard to some of the major global industries. This information is central for gaining a detailed understanding of the shifting material and social relations taking place in the region. In addition to the archival research, this dissertation's research is backed up by a multi-sited case study of the Caribbean region through ethnographic observations and interviews. This dissertation has aimed more precisely to synthesis my theoretical approach with my research findings. Rather than be chained to a rigid social experiment, I have moved back and forth between the questions I formulated and the data I collected.

By drawing on theories of global capitalism, migration, transnationalism, and diaspora it explores how the experience of Haitian migrants living in the Miami community of Little Haiti offer insights as to whether transnational, diasporic communities are uniquely placed to become socially aware and political active within their diasporic communities . Most studies on Haitians in the United States focus on New York. However, those residing in the global city of Miami are a unique population of mostly working-class Haitians who, marginalized by U.S. politicians, the media, and migrant groups in Florida, are rendered precarious. Such experiences can push Haitian migrants to maintain transnational links and form diasporic communities in areas such as the ethnic enclave of Little Haiti. Through participant observation and semi-structured interviews with Haitian volunteers and employees at the Little Haiti Community Support Center (LHCSC), in July 2014 I explored the lived experiences of politically engaged Haitian migrants residing in this diasporic community. From the interviews emerged a hybrid, at times ambivalent, diasporic political and cultural consciousness maintained through transnational forms of solidarity. Political consciousness developed in community and in strategic collaborations with other Black diasporic groups. Cultural consciousness functioned as a tool of empowerment and a medium for critiques of U.S. policies, aspects of Haitian culture, and gender norms. Activism solidified communities and families and cultivated new practices to pass on to the next generation.

Music",Music,David C. Paul,"This dissertation explores how music came to be accepted in late-nineteenth-century American university curricula as an element of what historian Laurence Veysey has called the liberal culture reform movement. Proponents of liberal culture focused on advancing the classically derived studies of language, philosophy, literature, and the arts in order to nurture students' sense of refined culture. Using research processes from intellectual history, I place music in the constantly shifting discourse surrounding university arts curricula. I show how proponents for music in higher education borrowed not only rhetoric from the liberal culture reform movement, but from a number of competing reform movements in an effort to legitimize music as an academic subject. I use sociological theories of institutionalism to show how this discourse influenced the architects of prestigious music programs. Furthermore, I examine the importance of women and gender on the establishment of music in American universities. I argue that it was ultimately the collaboration between sympathetic administrators and composers-turned-professors that shaped the foundation of music in the modern American university. To this end, I use three case studies that chronicle the development of music programs at three influential American universities. The first of these is centered on Harvard professor John Knowles Paine, who worked closely with President Charles W. Eliot to build a program that emphasized the role of music in a cultural education within the new elective system. The second case study revolves around composer Horatio Parker. The Yale professor prioritized the study of music composition while establishing a School of Music that offered applied instruction and a number of general education opportunities. The final case study is a culminating moment in the acceptance of music as a university discipline. Composer and Columbia professor Edward MacDowell envisioned music as part of an interdisciplinary department of fine arts that would include literature, sculpture, painting, and architecture. After MacDowell's controversial resignation due to disagreements with President Nicholas Murray Butler, discourse about music in higher education was reinvigorated. This time, however, it figured in a larger debate concerning idealism and materialism in the university and reached beyond the confines of the humanities.",Harvard,-71.1167,42.377,1

Geography",Geography,Helen M. Couclelis,"The results indicate that higher levels of cultural amenity-related employment are indeed associated with higher median home prices, providing support for the consumer-city hypothesis. Furthermore, levels of amenity-related employment at one point in time can be strong predictors of median home prices several years later, although they proved less useful for predicting the percentage change in median home values over time. Amenity-related employment may therefore be a potentially useful indicator to consider when predicting median home values. These findings also open up avenues for future research into the applicability of the consumer-city hypothesis in other First World countries as well as the developing world. The rise of the modern service- and information-based economy has accompanied an increased concern for quality of life compared to earlier eras. The consumer city hypothesis argues that in a post-industrial society, people increasingly value the location-specific amenities a particular city has to offer when deciding where to live. This is in contrast to traditional wisdom, which holds that jobs are the sole or most important criterion in attracting people to a given place. While other studies have found an association between natural amenities and greater demand for places that have them, there is much less work focusing on whether cultural amenities have the same effect. This analysis aims to discover whether there is additional evidence to support the consumer city hypothesis by investigating the relationship between cultural amenity levels (as measured by employment in amenity-related fields) and demand for particular places (as measured by median home prices). This study examines 357 Metropolitan Statistical Areas in the United States (including those in Alaska and Hawaii). Data from the American Community Survey and the Bureau of Labor Statistics were used to measure amenity-related employment, median home prices, and other demographic variables. Four linear regressions were run to determine the relationship between these variables in the years 2012 and 2005, as well as to discover the predictive value of amenity-related employment for future median home prices and changes in median home prices over time.",Hawaii,-155.5827818,19.8967662,2

The term ""temporariness"" is used to conceptualize the structures of feeling that emerge alongside the growing phenomena of provisional labor and transitory migration that correspond with the increase of globalization and neoliberalism of the late 20th and early 21st centuries. These rapidly growing cities are icons of the opportunity and development offered by the promises of globalization and neoliberal economic policies, which have ushered in increased free trade, deregulation, and privatization since the 1980s. The dissertation argues that the opportunities and promises of prosperity are not equally available to all, and we can, instead, observe the rise of temporariness as a sign of these inequalities. The temporariness of life for workers in neoliberal networks of trade and governance can benefit some, while disenfranchising others, and the distribution of benefit is often divided along hemispheric, national, racial, and gendered lines.

History",History,Alice O'Connor,"Performing arts centers, museums, public parks, and wealthy socialites are not the typical subjects of postwar United States urban and policy histories. Yet, these subjects provide new opportunities to challenge our understanding of the processes that reshaped the nation's postwar urban landscape. This dissertation looks at cultural initiatives and spaces of leisure as a way to understand the larger social, economic, and political forces that shaped Los Angeles after World War II--specifically, the Hollywood Bowl, the L.A. Music Center, the L.A. County Museum of Art, and Elysian Park. The construction and revitalization of these public spaces offers new avenues for examining the role of urban planning and policy in remaking American cities in the postwar era. Each of these spaces would add to a modern urban identity being crafted by metropolitan leaders. On its own, each chapter tells a unique and captivating story of civic negotiation. Yet, these episodes collectively tell an even more important story about the broader postwar project to remake L.A., as each space was shaped by the same people, agencies, and policies within the short span of twenty-five years. Thus, my primary objective in this dissertation is to examine not only the significance of constructing cultural spaces in the project to remake L.A. into a national cultural epicenter, but also what that story reveals about postwar urban growth and urban renewal policy in Los Angeles. This dissertation invites readers to rethink the parameters of urban renewal by considering cultural and leisure spaces as a lens through which to understand the post-World War II project of city building. This research builds on the work of urban historians, cultural historians, and policy historians to frame a new set of questions about the ways in which cultural institution-building came to fruition through broader urban renewal initiatives. I argue that the construction and revival of cultural and leisure spaces in Los Angeles after World War II sparked the beginnings of a rapidly growing cultural infrastructure intended to displace New York as the nation's premier cultural metropolis. Further, civic leaders would increasingly rely on urban renewal policy to construct cultural spaces, and in the process come to discover that culture could function well as urban renewal. Yet, the success of these institutions was limited. This emerging concept of culture as urban renewal occurred within the context of a political realignment that saw an extended period of alliance between businessmen, county and city officials, and cultural philanthropists who came together to support pro-growth initiatives, many of which centered on downtown. By rethinking conventional narratives of urban renewal, this research shows how crucial leisure spaces were to remaking American cities after World War II.",Hollywood,-118.3286614,34.0928092,2

History",History,Salim Yaqub,"From the early 1940s to the mid-1950s, millions of uncensored commercial and government-sanctioned American comic books flooded North America, Europe, Asia, and Latin America. Like popular music, modern art, and Hollywood films, comic books worked to define, for both domestic and global audiences, what it meant to be American during the mid-twentieth century. Invested with this power, comic books simultaneously presented American policymakers with an opportunity and a challenge. Inexpensive, portable, and comprehensible to a diverse readership, comic books provided government agencies with an excellent delivery system for propaganda. At home and abroad, they enabled American officials to mobilize support for a full-scale war against fascism and for a subsequent struggle against international communism. But the comic book medium was not easily controlled. Until 1954, commercial American comic books were not subject to any formal censorship organization. Comic book creators, coarsened by the horrors of World War II, utilized this freedom to produce remarkably violent, racist, and sexual narratives. These unsanctioned, unfettered comic books sold in huge quantities to a global audience, often challenging rather than supporting the state-sanctioned image of the United States. To the dismay of officials, such materials generated powerful anti-American sentiment abroad, seemingly vindicating communist accusations of American depravity. The result was an international anti-comic book campaign, a transatlantic protest against American cultural hegemony. Over the decade following World War II the American government met this challenge through a combination of repression and co-optation. At the local, state, and national levels, policymakers supported an American anti-comic book campaign that unfolded in parallel with the transatlantic effort. In 1954 the domestic campaign succeeded in compelling publishers to accept a censorship code. At the same time, the American government engaged in a policy of co-optation, appropriating the comic book medium in support of Cold War objectives. Domestically, federal agencies used comic books to promote Civil Defense through local organizations and public schools. Internationally, the State Department and the United States Information Agency made extensive use of anti-communist comic book propaganda, particularly in the decolonizing world. These measures transformed comic books into a tamer and more consensual medium.",Hollywood,-118.3286614,34.0928092,2

Music",Music,David Paul,"In the early 1980s, arts professionals from the National Endowment for the Arts, the Rockefeller Foundation, and OPERA America expressed concern with the scarcity of new American operas and the stagnation of standard European repertory. Many believed the solution was to borrow from the vital world of American avant-garde music theater occurring outside of opera establishments, most successfully represented by Philip Glass. This dissertation uses the reception of Glass as a lens to examine the discussion transpiring among members of these arts organizations, showing how the various interlocutors were critical for a sudden flourishing of American opera. I focus on the role adventurous impresarios have played in American discourse about opera, promoting ideological orientations and controlling the resources that sustain artist reputations. I show how Harvey Lichtenstein at the Brooklyn Academy of Music, Robert Brustein at the American Repertory Theater, and David Gockley at the Houston Grand Opera challenged the role of opera in American culture, lauding Glass's synthesis of popular and high art. Drawing from interviews and archival materials, this narrative charts interactions between Glass and the network of patrons, institutions, directors, critics, and performers who supported and influenced his work. I examine the meanings these people ascribed to Glass's music as a cultural phenomenon, situating their discourse within the context of the broader issues that vexed American opera. Exploring the activities of arts administrators provides a new entree into the larger world of American experimental music that nuances the ""maverick"" label that has so often been attached to Glass. As I contend, the various aesthetic frameworks that sustained the agendas of Lichtenstein, Brustein, and Gockley were at least as important in shaping public perceptions about Glass as anything the composer has said about himself. Because of these impresarios, Glass's operas became a model for innovation, bringing in record box office receipts and revitalizing American opera.",Houston,-95.3698028,29.7604267,1

Communication",Communication,Scott Reid,"If costly signaling theory is correct, contributions to online information pools must contain signals of some kind, signaling should be more intense under conditions where signalers are potentially rewarded by receivers, and receivers should be able to reliably infer signal content from contributions. This thesis tested whether contributions to ostensible wiki-style encyclopedias signal intelligence, group commitment, introversion-extraversion, or conscientiousness. To induce motivation, participants made their wiki-style contributions under conditions where they believed themselves to be either identifiable to receivers (i.e., and motivated to signal) or not. Contribution quality increased with participant intelligence, and, consistent with costly signaling theory, this was true only when participants believed they were identifiable to receivers. Online information pools such as Wikipedia, Youtube, and Reddit, rely on contributions from members to succeed. These venues operate as public goods, being non-excludable and non-rival, and they typically do not compensate contributors. As such, contributions appear to be altruistic, and the enterprise subject to collective action problems, such as free riding. Despite this, the internet is replete with examples of successful information pools. A potential but un-tested explanation for altruism in this context is found in costly signaling theory. Costly signaling theory assumes that altruism is apparent rather than real; signals are in fact genetically self-interested acts that are compensated by receivers. Further, receivers reliably inferred contributor intelligence from judgments of contribution quality, but only in when participants were identifiable. There was no evidence for signaling of other qualities. The findings suggest that contributions to online information pools are not examples of altruism, but are in fact signals of intelligence that are reliably inferred by receivers from contribution quality.

History",History,Carol Lansing,"This dissertation is an analysis of how Europe responded to the Mongols in the thirteenth- and fourteenth-centuries. In only sixty years the Mongols created the largest land empire the world has ever seen. After Mongol attacks on Eastern Europe---specifically Russia, Poland, Hungary, and the Balkans---in the 1230s--1240s, Europeans were petrified of the terrifying and unfamiliar invaders. However, at times this initial anxiety waned and even turned to hope for a European alliance with the Mongols against Muslim powers like the Mamluks of Egypt. Using travel narratives of missionaries who traveled in Mongol territories, diplomatic correspondence between khans, popes, and kings, evidence of panni tartarici (Tartar silk) in Europe, theological treatises, and tombstones of Europeans who died in Yuan China, I challenge a secondary literature that tends to portray European-Mongol relations during this period as static. I show how European understandings of the Mongols varied greatly and depended on contemporary political events. I argue that medieval Europeans saw the Mongols as both threat and ally, as a sign of the Apocalypse and a partner in the fight against Islam. These sentiments were not mutually exclusive. This study contributes to studies of world history and understandings of pre-modern transnational relations. Its diverse sources illustrate the complexity of European attitudes towards the Mongols, and demonstrate how important an interdisciplinary approach is for the study of the Mongol Empire.",Hungary,19.5033041,47.162494,2

Environmental Science and Management",Environmental Science and Management,Jeff Dozier,"Snow water equivalent (SWE) and its heterogeneity are two essential variables in the hydrologic cycle of a mountain environment. The first chapter explores two different modeling approaches to quantify a basin's snow pack: (1) forward modeling with the snow energy balance model Isnobal, and (2) reconstruction based on potential melt from Isnobal combined with fractional snow covered area from MODIS imagery, carried on the Terra and Aqua satellites. Basin-wide SWE and its heterogeneity were modelled for four water years in the Marble Fork of the Kaweah River, a 152 km2 basin in the Sierra Nevada. Two components of the heterogeneity of SWE were examined: that owing to accumulation and that resulting from snowmelt. Heterogeneity caused by accumulation is represented by reconstructed SWE before the onset of melt. It is highest above the timberline, where wind causes redistribution and sublimation. Reconstruction accounts for the heterogeneity of wind-redistributed snow at the beginning of the melt season, even though it does not model the actual distribution processes. Thus it provides an independent method of measuring the spatial distribution of snow, which is useful to validate models of snow accumulation, either owing to redistribution or to precipitation itself. Heterogeneity caused by melt emerges from the calculations in Isnobal. Throughout spring it stays low above the timberline, while an increase occurs at the lowest snow-covered elevations as well as at the transition between forested and open areas. The spatial distribution of these trends persists in all four years of the study, but in the wettest year, 2006, the delayed onset of melt muted the heterogeneity. Forest cover is the dominating factor, with intermediate canopy cover causing the highest heterogeneity in melt. As input to the reconstruction model, fractional snow covered area from MODIS (fSCA) is corrected for missing data, periodic fluctuations caused by the satellite orbit, clouds, and vegetation cover. These uncertainties propagate into the reconstruction, and their effects on modeled SWE are treated in chapter 2. Two potential uncertainties are analyzed: a bias in fSCA that scales with vegetation cover and an offset in final melt-out date. While a positive bias in fSCA has little effect, a negative bias alters reconstructed SWE. Prolonging the melt season increases SWE more than shortening decreases it (4%-12% increase per day versus 3%-6% decrease per day). Chapter 3 presents an analysis of the spatial distribution of precipitation in the densely monitored Reynolds Creek Experimental watershed in Southwest Idaho. Elevation-detrended kriging yields interpolation surfaces similar to the PRISM precipitation model but is able to capture local anomalies such as rain shadow and topographic exposure. A comparison between summed hourly and daily precipitation surfaces illustrates the importance of interpolating precipitation at high temporal resolution in regions spanning the rain-snow transition. Otherwise, errors in the partitioning between rain and snow contaminate the daily interpolation results, when the elevation of phase transition varied frequently.",Idaho,-114.7420408,44.0682019,1

Economics",Economics,"Kelly Bedard, Peter Kuhn","This dissertation consists of three essays in applied microeconomics that address topics of human and social capital accumulation. The first essay addresses the topic of women and STEM (science, technology, engineering and math.) Women are substantially less likely than men to graduate college with a STEM degree. This paper investigates whether class composition can help explain why women are disproportionately more likely to fall out of the STEM ""pipeline''. Identification comes from a standardized enrollment process at a large public university that randomly assigns freshmen to different mandatory introductory chemistry lectures. Using administrative data, I find that women who are enrolled in a class with higher ability peers are less likely to graduate with a STEM degree, while men's persistence in STEM is unaffected by class composition. I also show that the decline for women is most pronounced for those in the bottom third of the ability distribution. I rule out the possibility that this is driven solely by grades because both men and women receive higher grades in classes with higher ability peers. Overall, these results suggest that class composition as an important factor in determining STEM persistence for women and provide a novel explanation for part of the STEM gender gap in post-secondary education. The second essay, co-authored with Daniel Argyle, examines the effect of the four-day school week in rural Colorado on juvenile crimes. Four-day school weeks are becoming more common nationwide especially in rural areas. Those affected by the policy spend the same number of hours in school each week as students on a typical five-day week, however the four-day week schedule essentially reallocates unstructured time into larger blocks creating a three-day weekend every weekend, since treated students for the most part have Fridays off. Our difference-in-difference estimates for rural Colorado indicate that switching all students in a county from a five-day week to a four-day week increases juvenile arrests for property crimes, in particular larceny, by about 80%. In the third essay, co-authored with Christiana Stoddard, we study the academic achievement of American Indians. The academic achievement of American Indians has not been extensively studied. Using NAEP supplements, we find that the average achievement relative to white students resembles other disadvantaged groups. However, there are several differences. Family characteristics explain two times as much of the raw gap as for blacks. School factors also account for a larger portion of the gap than for blacks or Hispanics. The distribution is also strikingly different: low performing American Indian students have a substantially larger gap than high performing students. Finally, racial self-identification is more strongly related to achievement, especially as American Indian students age.",India,78.96288,20.593684,33

Economics",Economics,Richard Startz,"Understanding social influences is vitally important to understanding human behavior; unfortunately, observing and measuring these effects is extremely difficult. This dissertation focuses on applying and developing techniques to measure social influences on individual decision making. The first chapter develops two techniques for estimating social influences using friendship networks, even when individuals differ on unobservable attributes. The second chapter uses social networks sampled from villages in India to demonstrate strong peer influences on an individual's decision to take a microfinance loan. The final chapter examines changes in juvenile criminal behavior in response to their schools changing to a four-day school week. An abstract for each chapter is provided below. Chapter 2 Abstract: I use friendship networks from villages in rural India to provide a careful examination of peer effects in decisions to take up microfinance. Using social networks resolves the traditional identification problems associated with peer effect estimation and allows each individual to have their own peer group. Since the networks in question are sampled and some friendship information is missing, I use an analytic correction to ensure unbiased estimates as well as a technique known as graphical reconstruction to provide bounds on estimators accounting for possible configurations of the unobserved links in the data. In addition to including a variety of individual covariates, I control for observable characteristics of an individual's peers, examine different ways of specifying network links, and account for the probability of being informed about the program. Across these specifications I find positive and significant peer effects; an additional friend participating in microfinance increases the probability that an individual participates in microfinance by 6%-10%. Chapter 3 Abstract: There has been a recent trend to implement four-day school weeks, especially in rural areas. We show that changing to a four-day school week influences youth criminal activity in jurisdictions where these policies take effect, especially impacting property crime. Focusing on Colorado, where four-day school weeks are especially prevalent, we show that switching all students in a county to a four-day week leads to 0.75 additional juvenile arrests for larceny per 1,000 residents. Effects on other types of crime are inconclusive; estimated signs on drug and violent crimes are negative, although neither attains statistical significance. Chapter 1 Abstract: Existing methods for identifying peer effects in social networks require the assumption that there are no unobserved factors that determine both network links and the outcome of interest. Since this assumption is likely to be violated in most networks, I provide two distinct methods for estimating peer effects in the presence of individual heterogeneity. First, I show that if repeated observations on individuals are available, accounting for time-invariant individual attributes can restore identification. Second, I suggest a semi-parametric Bayesian instrumental variables technique that can be used to estimate peer effects models when panel data is not available or if fixed effects assumptions are undesirable. I demonstrate the properties of both strategies using simulated network data and provide evidence that both are able to estimate peer effects, even when networks exhibit sorting on observable and unobservable attributes. Additionally, I apply both techniques to estimate peer effects in the United States Congress using cosponsorship networks and voting outcomes.",India,78.96288,20.593684,33

Education",Education,Mian Wang,"The American disability service system is predicated on underlying assumptions and beliefs which are dominant in the majority culture. Consequently, minority families, such as families from India, living in America sometimes experience dissonance with respect to the services provided to their family due to their varying cultural values. As such, it is imperative that professionals are able to provide culturally responsive services which respect the customs and values of each family. It is also necessary that service providers are able to evaluate these families' satisfaction with the services they are receiving. Service Adequacy, Family Professional Partnership, and Family Quality of Life have been found to be valuable service outcomes within families in the majority culture in America. Studies examining whether these constructs are similar with families of Asian Indian descent are necessary in order to assess satisfaction and cultural fit of disability-related services, and to provide the most appropriate support to these families. The purpose of the current study was to examine factors that influenced family satisfaction with service adequacy, family professional partnership, and family quality of life as well as how these variables are interrelated particularly for families of Asian Indian descent living in America. Additionally, this mixed methods study aimed to gain information on which specific features of the disability system are considered to be most valuable or most hindering to families of Asian Indian descent as well as what the perceived barriers are to achieving positive family quality of life. These questions were examined through quantitative and qualitative data collected in two phases. Twenty-five participants responded to a survey providing information on their perspectives relating to special education and disability-related services and ten parents of children who have received special education and/or disability-related services participated in semi-structured interviews in which they were asked to share their experiences and beliefs relating to the services provided and the disability service system in America. Participant interviews were audio recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using methods informed by content analysis. Results of the quantitative analysis revealed that Asian Indian families had generally positive ratings of SA, FPP, and FQOL, with the most satisfaction reported with FPP. Results of multiple regression analyses indicated that child and family-level demographic variables were not predictive of SA, FPP, and FQOL. Among SA, FPP, and FQOL, FPP was found to be a significant predictor of FQOL; however SA was not found as a significant predictor of FQOL. Analysis of the ten parent/caregiver interviews revealed two major themes contributing to the discussion of the most valuable and most hindering aspects of the American disability service system: (a) Parental Involvement, or parental participation in services, parental knowledge and expertise, parents as advocates, and parent education; and (b) Service Provisions, or barriers to and methods of accessing diagnoses and effective services, agency and organizational factors, and navigating the service system. In regards to the perceived barriers to achieving a positive family quality of life, three major themes emerged from analysis of the interview data: (a) Impact on Family, or impact on family members and family life; (b) Cultural Norms, or the impact of culture, acceptance of disability, and access to supports; and (c) Community Resources, or the ways in which parents obtained support. Finally, the appropriateness of FQOL, SA, and FPP in measuring family outcomes with the Asian Indian population was established. Overall, results of the present study provide a significant contribution to the literature as this study represents one of the first attempts at researching Asian Indian family perceptions with the American disability service system. Further, the present research highlights the importance of culturally competent services, and in particular, an understanding of cultural beliefs in regards to the roles of parents in the parent-professional partnership. This study also underscores the need for professionals to act as advocates for both children with special needs and their parents by connecting them to supports and assisting them with making accommodations and adaptations to their family life. Finally, methodological issues with respect to conducting research with the Asian Indian population are discussed.",India,78.96288,20.593684,33

This is especially true for mathematics since narratives also position math as the ultimate sign of intelligence and academic superiority. This narrative inquiry implicates such socio-historical, cultural, political narratives and their associated binaries in the (re)production of inequities in mathematics and with Walkerdine (1990) contends that ""the issue was never about `real' performances, but the stories we tell about them, the discourses in which they are inscribed and the positions these make available to the learner"" (p. 135). To this end, this project explored the stories 44 high school students told about mathematics, the narratives their stories were situated in and the positions these made available to the students as learners. Through competing & contradictory narratives, the homes students built were tied to complex multiple identities, including race, ethnicity, nation, gender, sexuality, class, athlete, and often included tensions, constraints & oppositions. Students negotiated their relationships to mathematics through two particular competing meta-narratives -- the Intellectual Development Discourse and the Schooling Discourse. Some students negotiated relationships with mathematics that were central (Central Street homes), some students negotiated relationships with mathematics via an Alpha phenomenon (Alpha Way homes) and some students negotiated relationships that were peripheral to mathematics (Peripheral Circle homes). Students whose identities were aligned with the higher status side of narrative binaries worked within the associated Discourses had the least tensions and were more likely to develop a relationship with mathematics where they could locate themselves as ""good at math."" This is because their experiences and lived realities worked to produce the pattern of binaries and their performance as ""natural."".",India,78.96288,20.593684,33

English",English,Janis Caldwell,"In 1822, just before Christmas, London publisher Rudolph Ackermann produced a beautiful volume called Forget-Me-Not: A Christmas and New Year's Present for 1823. Filled with pictures accompanied by poetry, the Forget-Me-Not inspired myriad imitators, known collectively as literary annuals. By the early 1830s, the Forget-Me-Not and its roughly one hundred competitors---each selling edition sizes in the thousands if not tens of thousands---were given by their purchasers as holiday gifts to friends or family. Despite literary annuals' popularity, which lasted into the 1850s, their peculiar media conventions and contributions to contemporary cultural discourse have not been well understood. This dissertation recovers literary annuals' significance through the relationship between texts and images in their pages. Typically, annuals' editors began with pictures (usually steel-plate engravings), and then hired contributing authors to write poetry or prose to accompany each one. I examine annuals' use of ekphrasis---or in the annuals' terms, ""poetical illustration""---as it is understood in neuroscientific and psychoanalytic studies: as an artistic display of proprioceptive or cross-modal thinking, processes that are central to one's ability to differentiate oneself from others, and which allow for inter-subjective experience as well. I also incorporate analyses of ekphrasis that compare the text's approach to the image with the self's approach to otherness, as well as accounts that emphasize the importance of affect in the interpretation of images. From this standpoint I consider in detail annuals' contributions to two overlapping discourses in early 19th-century Britain: the development of a national historiography that comprehended the increasingly politically-empowered middle class (annuals' primary audience), and the development of British imperialism in Asia, particularly India and China. By looking at topical trends in several of the longest-running literary annuals over time, including the Oriental Annual, Finden's Tableaux, Fisher's Drawing Room Scrapbook, and The Keepsake, I show how the multimedia practice of ""poetical illustration"" facilitated improvisational engagements with historiographic and imperialist discourses. By closely reading several annuals, I demonstrate their social contribution beyond their circulation as gifts. In their unique employment of ekphrasis, they characterized the production of Britain's self-image as contingent, improvisational, and constantly negotiable.",India,78.96288,20.593684,33

English",English,Stephanie LeMenager,"Smart Reading contributes to the field of American Studies by investigating how the advent of a science of intelligence---beginning with IQ tests---influenced American writers after the turn of the twentieth century. Historically speaking, such a science marked a shift in our understanding of intelligence because it was no longer a reflection of one's education, social class, or biography. It came to be a fixed biological fact. Drawing on theory in disciplines as diverse as cognitive science, literary studies, geography, philosophy and sociology, this project argues that the language of intelligence therefore depends on the science (and pseudoscience) of race. Whereas the concept of intelligence has been deployed to restrict access of racial Others to American institutions, the nation has depended on those racial Others to define the terms of intelligence. Furthermore, the American experience of different ethnic groups has helped to congeal a phenomenological theory of intelligence that takes into account the relationship between a subject and her lived space. Specifically, this dissertation focuses on the ethnic groups of Jews, African Americans and American Indians.

Film and Media Studies",Film and Media Studies,Bhaskar Sarkar,"This project investigates media's role in technoscience controversies by focusing on four case studies from India: issues of chronic toxicity in the continuing aftermath of the Bhopal gas disaster; disputes over regulating emission of potentially carcinogenic electromagnetic radiation by mobile towers; battles over building atomic power plants between nuclear nationalists on one hand and anti-nuclear pacifists and affected local communities on the other; public deliberations leading to a moratorium on genetically modified eggplants. I do not suggest that each technology determines its own particular discourse. Rather, I focus on how science as culture interacts with media discourses and cultural values: newsworthiness, nationalism, security, framing, globalization, and democracy. The debates I explore are not restricted to ""objective"" scientific processes, but are instead marked by incommensurable values, competing expertise, and radical uncertainties. These controversies spiral out in the public domain, where the expressive and persuasive characteristics of media prove crucial. A technoscience public consisting of--scientists, activists, policy-makers, and affected patients--that gathers around a disruptive technology, such as a nuclear reactor or cell tower antennae, cannot be materialized or imagined without the circulation of discourses through the process of mediation. Thus, technoscience publics and media publics intersect and reconfigure each other, and in each chapter, I trace the different unfolding debates by tracking the dynamic reconfigurations of the ""mediated technoscience publics."" Through an elaboration of the concept ""mediated technoscience publics"" my dissertation provides both a theoretical vocabulary and a methodological approach to study media and technoscience/environmental debates together. I emerge with notions of media that at once retain the specificity of a particular media format like a talk show or a media object like a cell phone, and yet are not tied to any one of them. I conceptualize media landscapes as circulatory systems of signs and signals, discourses and matter, representations and resonances. My approach emphasizes close examination of media practices (Ursula Rao, Brian Larkin) and performative mediation (Sarah Kember and Joanna Zylinska) to theorize the materiality of scientific knowledge production and publics (Karen Barad, Alexander Kluge, Jane Bennett).",India,78.96288,20.593684,33

French",French,Eric Prieto,"This work delineates the unique role theatre plays in the establishment of Martinican and Guadeloupian cultural and national identity independent from (although integrated with) the dominant French culture of their former colonizers. As French overseas departments, both Martinique's and Guadeloupe's public school system has been imported from France and thus imposes an alienating French emphasis on West Indian consciousness and identity. Yet theatre offers a new place for cultural education because it can instill pride, consciousness and identity in a localized form particular to Martinique and Guadeloupe. This important educational function is especially notable in the plays analyzed here, which are virtually absent from the critical literature on the French Caribbean, yet clearly merit a closer look. I examine a corpus of over twenty French West Indian plays. I consider these plays as cultural manifestations of what Martinicans and Guadeloupians value and disparage. I look at this theatre also as a national theatre wherein a narrative of the nation is fabricated and affirmed publically. I study Martinicans and Guadeloupians through their theatrical cultural manifestations which themselves focus on historical and contemporary events. Thus my analysis contributes cultural and historical depth to the rapidly evolving field of French Caribbean theatre criticism. My dissertation examines works, 1960-present, by Aime Cesaire, Edouard Glissant, Daniel Boukman, Ina Cesaire, Rene Louise and Patrick Chamoiseau, to name a few. One can discern in these works an independent cultural identity, which can be illuminated by the lens of ""auto-ethnography."" This term refers to Glissant and Chamoiseau's interest in studying and transcribing their own cultures with both the critical eye of an outside observer and the deep understanding of a native informant. Although the other authors did not self-identify as auto-ethnographers, I argue that one can apply this concept more broadly. The early 1960s were a crucial time when many colonies were fighting for and gaining independence. Although not directly engaged in anti-colonial struggles, Martinicans and Gaudeloupians nevertheless participated in independence movements and theatre was a significant arena for articulating these issues. Prior to this moment, imitation and reproduction of French theatre, culture, and society reigned; from the 1960s onward, playwrights focused on the expression and resuscitation of local history and culture. To facilitate this expression, many writers turned toward popular movements such as Negritude, Antillanite, and Creolite, enabling a cultural education and affirming an identity particular to both Martinique and Guadeloupe.",India,78.96288,20.593684,33

Numerical models based on chronologic and thermal constraints across southern Madagascar indicate that radioactive decay of thorium was the principal heat source responsible for regional metamorphism at temperatures >900 C in the middle to lower crust. (I) Geochronology, thermochronology, and structural observations across Gianbul gneiss dome provide insight about the exhumation of middle crust in the India-Asia collision zone: Doming (1) initiated during the early stages of extension; (2) was driven by a positive feedback among dehydration melting, buoyancy, and decompression; and (3) culminated with the injection of anatectic melts into the upper levels of the dome. The dome was subsequently exhumed as part of a footwall block beneath a brittle normal fault. (III) The Neoproterozoic era was punctuated by profound tectonic, evolutionary, and environmental change. Biologic and climatic conditions may have been especially sensitive to fluxes of phosphorus (P) from the weathering of continental crust. Large igneous provinces-containing abundant P and highly susceptible to chemical weathering-occurred regularly during the breakup of the Rodinia supercontinent. An estimated bioavailable P flux to the ocean from the weathering of basalt peaked at _720 Ma, immediately prior to rapid biologic diversification and the Sturtian glaciation; I postulate that the burial of organic carbon that resulted from this unprecedented P flux helped facilitate glaciation and triggered the oxidation of the ocean-atmosphere system.",India,78.96288,20.593684,33

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Douglas W. Burbank,"The Himalayas are a surface manifestation of the ongoing collision of the Indian and Asian plates. As stress accumulates along the collision zone, it is released during large earthquakes that pose an enormous threat to the growing populations in the region. The destructive power of these earthquakes was demonstrated most recently by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in central Nepal, which caused over ten thousand casualties. Most large Himalayan earthquakes occur along the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT), which is the active plate boundary beneath the range. In addition to generating large earthquakes, tectonic movement along the MHT results in mountain building. Recent theoretical and technical advances have led to the realization that rates of rock uplift, which reflect the structure of the faults in the subsurface, are, to a degree, encoded into the landscape form (i.e., tectonics can be read from topography). Analysis of Himalayan topography reveals that the mountain front in western Nepal is characterized by two steps, as opposed to the rest of the central Himalaya, which features a single, dramatic mountain front. This distinction is likely related to a previously unknown along-strike change in the geometry and history of tectonic structures beneath the range. Specifically, it is hypothesized that mid-crustal deformation has recently shifted from the northern topographic step to the southern, raising a broad area between them that is now preserved as a high-elevation, low-relief landscape. In order to test the hypothesis that the study area in western Nepal is undergoing transient incision due to recent uplift of the low-relief landscape between the two mountain fronts, modern erosion rates are estimated in twelve watersheds that drain the two topographic steps and the high-elevation, low-relief landscape between them. Erosion rates vary by an order of magnitude and appear to be a function of watershed morphology, which is in turn a function of the watershed's position with respect to an upstream-migrating wave of incision that appears to be related to the hypothesized rejuvenated uplift along the southern mountain front. In a parallel study aimed at constraining the longer-term history of deformation in the study area, low-temperature thermochronology is employed to estimate rock-uplift rates from bedrock cooling ages. Inversion of these data using a thermo-kinematic model yields best-fit rock-uplift rates, which are compared to predictions from the hypothesis presented above. Results show that the main zone of rock uplift in well-studied central Nepal makes a sharp turn to follow the northern mountain front in western Nepal, away from the trend of the rest of the range, which would otherwise follow the southern mountain front. In contrast, rock uplift has been slow since ~10 Ma along the southern mountain front, and the hypothesized recent uplift there can be no older than 4 Ma. In summary, the recent tectonic history in western Nepal differs significantly from the trend exhibited in adjacent segments of the range. This distinction has important implications for the possible locations of future seismic activity, the paleoseismic record in western Nepal, and the ongoing evolution of the range.",India,78.96288,20.593684,33

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Syee Weldeab,"Most of our knowledge about the history of Indian and Asian monsoons has relied on delta18O records extracted from cave deposits in India and China. While these records are highly resolved and have the most robust age models, the reliance on a single proxy, delta18O, as an indicator of changes in precipitation amount harbors significant uncertainty. This is due to the difficulty in separating the various components influencing calcareous delta18O records. Here we present an independent and spatially integrated measure of past Indian summer monsoon precipitation extracted from a sediment sequence recovered from the northern Bay of Bengal, an area within a runoff-induced low salinity plume. The focus is on the time window spanning Termination II and Marine Isotope Stage 5 (145-70 kyr BP). We use delta18O, Ba/Ca, and Mg/Ca analyzed in tests of the surface-dwelling planktonic foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber (white). Comparison of the temperature and ice volume corrected delta 18Osw record with the Ba/Ca record, a proxy for runoff, shows important differences. Consistent with the Kutzbach's hypothesis (Kutzbach, 1981), the Ba/Ca record indicates that strong monsoon intensities correspond with strong northern hemisphere summer insolation with a decreasing trend from strongest monsoon during MIS 5e (~130 kyr BP) and weakest during MIS 5a (80 kyr BP). In contrast, delta18Osw shows monsoon runoff to be comparable or stronger during MIS 5c and 5a relative to 5e. The delta18O-based observation shares some commonality with the results of East Asian and West African monsoon reconstructions. We removed the delta18Osw component related to runoff amount from the delta18Osw record and obtained delta 18Oresidual, which due to the setting we primarily interpret to reflect changes in the delta18O of precipitation (delta 18Oprecipitation). delta18Oprecipitation is significantly depleted during MIS 5a and 5c relative to 5e and enriched during Termination II. Variations in the delta18O of precipitation in the Indian and East Asian domains, likely result from changes in moisture source, pathway, and the seasonality of precipitation. The major result of this study lies in revealing a large-scale imprint in calcareous delta 18O archives unrelated to the amount of precipitation and establishing an independent record of ISM precipitation during the last interglacial.",India,78.96288,20.593684,33

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Lorraine Lisiecki,"The development of high quality age models for paleoclimate records is critical for constraining leads, lags, and rates of change within the climate system, which helps to elucidate the mechanisms of past climate changes. For example, improvements to age models for paleoclimate records from marine sediment cores were central to proving Milankovitch theory. In this dissertation, I compiled a quality-controlled database of almost 300 previously published benthic foraminiferal oxygen isotope (delta 18O) records from globally distributed sites. The only way to directly date marine sediments is by radiocarbon dating, but this technique can only be used back to about 40,000 years ago and is subject to uncertainties about past surface reservoir age changes. Chapter 2 presents an averaged high-latitude North Atlantic reservoir age reconstruction based on aligning 33 deep North Atlantic benthic delta18O records and comparing high- and low-latitude planktonic foraminiferal radiocarbon dates. This reconstruction shows increased reservoir ages during the beginning of the last deglaciation and the Younger Dryas, which suggests that previous chronologies based on the assumption of constant reservoir age need to be revised by up to about 1,000 years. North Atlantic reservoir ages are also a proxy for Atlantic meridional overturning circulation strength, so deglacial reservoir age excursions provide insight into the timing and role of ocean circulation changes during the deglaciation. Regional benthic delta18O stacks and chronologies fill an important niche between global stacks and studies comparing a few well-dated records. Chapter 3 presents seven different regional benthic delta 18O stacks with independent planktonic 14C-based age models for 0-40,000 years ago. The stacks show regional differences in the timing of benthic delta18O change of up to 4,000 years during the last deglaciation. In Chapters 4 and 5, the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian benthic delta18O stacks are extended beyond the limits of radiocarbon to 145,000 years ago and combined into a single volume-weighted global stack. The regional stacks aligned to proxy data with well-constrained absolute age estimates provide improved chronostratigraphic constraints for the last glacial cycle. The volume-weighted global stack demonstrates errors of up to 4,000 years in the currently accepted global benthic delta 18O stack.",India,78.96288,20.593684,33

Mixed layer dwelling planktonic foraminifer Globigerinoides ruber (white) from core material retrieved from the northern Bay of Bengal, tropical Indian Ocean, were used to create a record of Ba/Ca, Mg/Ca, and delta 18O variations. Time-series of Ba/Ca-based sea surface salinity (SSS), delta 18O of sea water, and Mg/Ca-based sea surface temperature are used to investigate millennial-scale variability of the ISM and its relationship to Bay of Bengal sea surface temperature through the last glacial (95--25 kyr BP). The proxy records indicate that the ISM responded sensitively to rapid changes in oceanic and atmospheric perturbation. Intensification of ISM, as indicated by a decrease in runoff-induced SSS, corresponds to episodes of warm air temperature over Greenland, known as Dangaard-Oeschger (DO) interstadials. Concomitant to Heinrich events our record indicates an abrupt weakening of ISM. A weak correlation between Ba/Ca-based SSS and Mg/Ca-based sea surface temperature indicates a decoupling between SST and Indian summer monsoon precipitation during millennial-scale events. Divergences in the timing, pace, and magnitude of Ba/Ca-based SSS and delta18Olocal seawater (temperature and ice volumes components removed) reveals local delta 18O changes related to ISM variability are likely caused by many factors. Furthermore, the record of delta18Oresidual that has been established by removing the ice volume, temperature, and salinity components from foraminiferal delta18O, suggests that decline in monsoon strength was accompanied by an increase in the delta18 O of precipitation during northern high-latitude stadials. Dissimilarity between the Ba/Ca-based SSS and delta18Olocal seawater records as well as significant delta18Oresidual variability suggest the imprint of millennial-scale ISM changes on the delta18O record may be more complicated than previously thought. An enrichment of delta18Oresidual is present during Heinrich events. One possible explanation for this observation is that concomitant to the decline in monsoon precipitation the isotope composition of precipitation was significantly enriched, most likely suggesting changes in source and pathway of the moisture. Therefore, reconstruction of past ISM changes solely on basis of delta18O records may lead to inaccurate assessment of precipitation change. Overall, the record from the northern Bay of Bengal indicates that the ISM responds very sensitively to changes in millennial-scale northern high-latitude temperature and ice sheet instability.",India,78.96288,20.593684,33

Global and International Studies",Global and International Studies,"Raymond Clemencon, Richard Appelbaum","This study looks at the potential of integrated food systems to meet sustainable development goals. Drawing on relevant literature and field research, it first explains the rationale behind integrated food systems for development, discussing the functionality, thinking and theory behind food system integration. It then looks at the cultural and historical context of the current food system in the chosen research sites of Central and Northern India. Turning next to policy, this work discusses how contemporary food systems in India, and in general, are shaped by agricultural policy, and how policy frameworks may be re-configured to better incentivize integrated food systems. This is followed by a general discussion of several issues related to integrated food systems for development: consumption, gender, participatory approaches and spatial and temporal scales. This paper argues that food system integration can help to achieve specific Millennium Development Goals, most notably reductions in poverty and hunger and environmental sustainability. The researcher concludes that if properly supported by favorable policy measures, funding, and public perception, integrated food systems have the ability to contribute to the achievement of sustainable development goals. Finally this paper concludes by identifying areas where further research is needed and recommending specific policy measures which could be utilized to incentivize the wider adoption of integrated food systems.",India,78.96288,20.593684,33

Global and International Studies",Global and International Studies,"Aashish Mehta, David Lopez-Carr","Through the context of the Punjabi agricultural development experience, this thesis examines the social, political, and economic implications of reforming India's current input subsidization strategy for agricultural developments. I conclude that changes are needed to allow for diversification in Punjab's agricultural sector and larger economy. Environmental, social and economic sustainability were not prioritized at the onset of the green revolution in Punjab and the adverse effects of input subsidies on the state exemplify this fact. Environmental degradation, human health complications, and fiscal deficits are visible in Punjab. Punjab has been the beneficiary of significant public investment funds for agriculture, allowing the state to become a cereal production powerhouse. Recently, however, the economic and agricultural growth enjoyed in Punjab has begun to stagnate, and may potentially be in decline, as continued input subsidization limits incentive for diversification. The prioritization of the agricultural sector of the economy has led to limited growth in the secondary and tertiary sectors where further diversification could allow for more non-farm employment opportunities. Changes to the state agricultural support structure were limited during the reform period of the 1990's, but a reduction in input subsidies could allow more holistic and equitable rural development in India by shifting government funds toward investment in education, infrastructure, and agricultural research and development. Ultimately, a gradual reduction of input subsidies, coupled with the utilization and enforcement of minimum support prices, could lead to more diversification within the agricultural sector. Agricultural extension services through the Punjab Agricultural University need to be highly engaged in the transitional period to inform farmers of their options for diversification. The fiscal savings realized through a reduction in input subsidies could allow for government investment in long term growth, improving urban and rural Punjabi livelihoods and could serve as a case study for burgeoning African nations to follow.",India,78.96288,20.593684,33

Many of these people are unable to afford the devices they need and current makeshift solutions are unsuitable for a variety of reasons. I am a volunteer for Intelligent Mobility International (IMI), a non-profit that seeks to address this situation by producing and distributing durable, inexpensive wheelchairs in the developing world. This thesis designs a study to gauge the impacts receiving an IMI wheelchair has on the lives of people with disabilities and their families. This measure can then be used in the future when Intelligent Mobility evaluates different program options and demonstrates to funders the positive impacts of their donations. The study involves a randomized field trial in Tamil Nadu, India. Candidates for the trial will be identified by a local grass roots organization and verified by IMI to be appropriate candidates for the wheelchair. A total of six hundred candidates will be chosen to represent a good mixture of gender, education, household size and age of the target population, and then randomly assigned to either the treatment or control group. Participants in the treatment group will receive a wheelchair at the start of the year and those in the control at the end of the year. The two groups will then be surveyed on many dimensions of their lives using both open-ended ethnographic interviews and a numerical categorical survey both at the start of the year and the end of the year to estimate the impacts of the wheelchair. The ethnographic interviews will help ensure that the participants' views are captured accurately and will permit a more realistic interpretation of the study's qualitative results.

History",History,R. Stephen Humphreys,"Outside of Iran, Muslims denigrated Zoroastrians through unflattering comparisons. They likened Zoroastrians to Vikings, Qadarites, and other groups perceived as unfamiliar, pagan, or heretical. Such comparisons, made by Muslims who had little experience with actual Zoroastrians, were highly rhetorical and intended for internal consumption. Like tales of fire temple desecration, they ultimately facilitated the construction of the Muslims' own communal identity. Therefore, not even the harsh Islamic discourse validates the lachrymose narrative of Zoroastrian history. Rather, the existence of competing Muslim discourses about Zoroastrians reveals the contested, contingent, and contextual nature of Muslim-Zoroastrian relations in early Islamic history. This dissertation treats Muslim-Zoroastrian relations between the seventh and eleventh centuries. It challenges the lachrymose narrative of Zoroastrian history, which overemphasizes the role of religious violence in precipitating the decline of Zoroastrianism after the Islamic conquest of Iran. This gloomy narrative is a product of Orientalist tropes, polemical historiographies about the treatment of dhimmis and the effect of the Islamic conquest, the apocalyptic tenor of medieval Zoroastrian sources, and concerns about the status of Zoroastrians in modern Iran and India. Scholars of Zoroastrianism and Iranian languages have written most of the secondary literature on this topic, despite the fact that most of the primary sources were written by Muslims in Arabic. Since few Islamicists have studied Muslim-Zoroastrian relations, the lachrymose narrative persists. However, there was a harsh Islamic discourse about Zoroastrians. Local histories of Iranian cities are replete with tales of fire temple desecration. Medieval Muslim historians in South Asia often invented tales of Hindu temple desecration as part of a triumphal narrative of religious supersession. Iranian historians did likewise. Although there are a few credible accounts of temple desecration, the secondary literature too often fails to properly contextualize them. These attacks, when considered in context, do not seem to have been motivated primarily by religious animus. The scale and religious significance of fire temple desecration has been exaggerated. There are two competing discourses about Zoroastrians in the early Islamic sources---one accommodating, the other harsh. The accommodating discourse, embedded in reports about the conduct of the Prophet Muhammad, urged Muslims to tax Zoroastrians and, later, to treat them like People of the Book. Abbasid scribes attempted to relieve Zoroastrians of particular legal disabilities by forging the 'ahd-nama, a charter of religious freedom that the Prophet Muhammad supposedly issued to the descendants of Salman al-Farisi. This charter, which belongs to several genres of Islamic literature, probably had a Muslim author. It indicates that there were hybrid religious sympathies in early Islamic Iran, which challenges the lachrymose narrative of Zoroastrian history.",India,78.96288,20.593684,33

History",History,Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval,"This study uncovers the roots of racism in the Southwest during the first half of the twentieth century and explores how racism affected people of color. It does so by examining connections between racism during the twentieth century and the historical and ideological legacy of Westward expansion. Frontier mores, such as violence, individualism, masculinity, and landownership, that justified Indian removal in the United States during the nineteenth century continued to inform racial prejudice in the Southwest well into the twentieth century. In the context of racial prejudice, this dissertation examines the experiences of people of color who lived, worked, and farmed in Imperial Valley, California. It delves into the complexities of race relations and racial prejudices within a multiplicity of racial groups in the Valley. In doing so, this study goes beyond the Black-white and Mexican-white binaries and investigates racism in the context of a pattern of ethnic and racial succession that included Yuma Indians, Japanese, Punjabis, Mexicans, Filipinos, and white Dust Bowl migrants. Within this multiethnic approach, it emphasizes the contributions of Yuma Indians during the beginnings of industrialized agriculture in the Valley and examines their experiences alongside those of Mexicans and whites. Moreover, this dissertation develops a new perspective on race relations by addressing the conflicts people of color experiences within their own ethnic and/or racial group, in particular, the turmoil that existed within the Japanese and Punjabi communities. They confronted racial prejudice in the larger white community while grappling with dysfunction within their respective racial and/or ethnic group. This study probes the strikes that swept the Valley during the Great Depression and asks how the values which emerged during the expansion of the West informed the violent practices and rhetoric large growers employed. Finally, this work addresses how frontierism promoted white supremacy during World War II as white citizens blamed interethnic violence, racial tensions, and poor moral values on the proximity of the U.S.-Mexico border. The border took on a deeply racialized meaning in the Valley as whites upheld the hierarchal and unequal power dynamic which harkened back to the arrival of the first colonists.",India,78.96288,20.593684,33

History of Art and Architecture",History of Art and Architecture,Edward B. Robertson,"This dissertation explores the emergence of the suntanned white body in the United States between the World Wars and its dual significance to modernism and the eugenics movement. The suntan serves as a revealing lens for examining the nexus of health, class, gender, and race in early American modernist art and visual culture. Rather paradoxically, as Euro-Americans were trying to preserve certain racial boundaries through eugenics, they also experimented with their own skin color in unprecedented ways. Yet through the popular practice of suntanning, Euro-Americans often transgressed the very racial color lines they sought to maintain. Suntanning---a physical transformation whose most visceral form is the visual---has yet to be critically examined as a subject of History of Art and Architecture. This study considers the nineteenth-century medical origins of suntanning as heliotherapy, modern notions of the skin as surface in the consumer culture of the 1920s and '30s, and the primitivist impulse of early American modernist artists in their appropriation of Native American cultural references as well as skin tone. I examine a broad spectrum of visual material ranging from travel, fashion, and cosmetic advertisements to Alfred Stieglitz's photographic portraits of a suntanned Georgia O'Keeffe ""playing Indian."" I also assert that suntanning is a visual phenomenon in and of itself, a performative process by which skin changes color and texture and becomes a natural canvas. The tanned white body, therefore, serves as a floating signifier suggesting everything from eugenic health to primitivist desire.

History of Art and Architecture",History of Art and Architecture,Swati Chattopadhyay,"Prison construction was among the most important infrastructural changes brought about by British rule in nineteenth-century India. It introduced India to a radically new system of punishment based on long-term incarceration. These prisons were designed to respond to the demand for a more rigorous mode of convict discipline by implementing a strict penal system based on remunerative labor. At the same time, these controlled spaces provided the British an opportunity to study and explore the bodies of Indian convicts from medical, labor, and anthropological perspectives. Visual representations of prisons and prisoners helped to codify British colonial opinions about the particular characteristics of the Indian convict, as well as the need for the prison institution in India. My dissertation studies these processes of representation through an examination of prison architecture and the spatial formations of prisons in colonial Bengal, between, 1858 and 1911, a period that witnessed critical transformations of the penal landscape. Changes included the construction of numerous central and district jails, medical management that aimed to reduce prisoner mortality, and the implementation of a streamlined program of prison labor. By analyzing the visual and architectural archive of these prisons, I propose a new spatial model for understanding how the prison both exemplifies and challenges the claims of British colonial rule.

Music",Music,Scott L. Marcus,"This dissertation challenges two key assumptions that structure nearly all historical accounts of modern North Indian classical music: (1) that Muslim musicians imposed a ""secretive"" and ""jealously guarded"" monopoly over the field from the seventeenth to the twentieth centuries and (2) that upper-caste Hindus eventually penetrated this monopoly only by the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries under the protective umbrella of a nationalist musical reform movement. Both assumptions attempt to explain a demographic shift among musicians from a Muslim to a Hindu majority over the twentieth century. Though recent scholarship has begun to suggest a more complex reality, most accounts still presume a neat sequence of two consecutive ""dominances"" characterized by intrinsic cultural essences: the first, (intransigent, insular and pre-modern) Muslim; and the second, (nationalistic, communalistic and modern) Hindu. Nearly all of this research, moreover, is based on a limited set of data generally dated no earlier than the 1870s and thus within the nationalist period of musical reform. My research, reaching a full century earlier to a period that set the stage for a later Hindu-led reform, reveals a rather different picture. Specifically, I highlight the role of several overlooked factors that led Brahmans to take up music much earlier than is commonly recognized during the late eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries and that may have continued to inform Brahman participation well into the twentieth. These include: the British colonial policy of indirect rule (Chapter One); the legacy of pre-colonial traditions of Mughal patronage (Chapter Two); the persistence of the claim to continuities within the musical theoretical treatise tradition (Chapter Three); and---contrary to the stereotype---the pedagogical generosity of Muslim musicians (Chapters, Four, Five and Six). All of these factors are illustrated by a historical study of a prominent Brahman family from the central Indian city of Ujjain, the Ashtewales, who first entered music as patrons and apprentices of Muslim hereditary professionals in the early nineteenth century, but who eventually became hereditary professionals themselves in the mid-twentieth century. Their example suggests a need to reconfigure commonly held understandings of the roots of contemporary communal realities in music.",India,78.96288,20.593684,33

Political Science",Political Science,Paige Digeser,"This dissertation establishes a new analytic approach to understanding fundamental political ideas of other cultures and time periods and applies it to a study of ancient Greek and Indian conceptions of ruling. What I call a historical-comparative approach builds on continuing debates over how best to develop a cross-cultural perspective in political philosophy. Accordingly, I show how this approach enhances analytic rigor for both the history of political ideas and normative political philosophy while preventing culturally reductionist comparisons. Examining ancient Greek and Indian political thought ca. 1500--650 BCE provides an important test of this approach because ruling questions were central to both Greek and Indian cultures. This study focuses on Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Hesiod's Theogony and Works and Days, and the Vedic Sam&dotbelow;hit as and Brahman&dotbelow;as. Ruling proves to be the most important political concept in each tradition, although each one develops a very different understanding of what it means to rule. I elucidate the earliest tradition of Indian political thought as one of stewardship and the Greek tradition as one of distinction. Using the Indian tradition as a cross-cultural vantage point provides critical leverage to better understand the emergence of self-possessed individuality in the Western tradition, further uncovering the earliest move towards a democratic way of thinking. Finally, I make a critical-normative move and draw upon the Indian understanding to challenge ancient and contemporary Western beliefs about ruling. I then formulate an alternative understanding of ruling predicated on an outwardly porous, polycentric conception of individuality that addresses contemporary issues of human-centrism, individualism, and communal interconnectedness.",India,78.96288,20.593684,33

Religious Studies",Religious Studies,Barbara A. Holdrege,"In part II of my study, I consider the samadhi shrine as an expression of sacred space, which contributes to our knowledge of a prevalent and significant form of sacred space in the Indian religious milieu that has received relatively little attention. The study specifically concerns the samadhi shrine compound of Jnaneshvar Maharaj (thirteenth century C.E.), the founding guru of the Varkari tradition, and to a certain extent, the broader network of samadhi shrines associated with the this Maharashtrian bhakti movement. I argue that the Varkari tradition's understanding of the perfected body of the realized saint, as expressed by Jnaneshvar himself, allows for the saint's body to be revered as a murti and the space of the surrounding samadhi shrine to function as a particular kind of temple. Moreover, I show that, as in the case of the Minak_hi-Sundareshvara and Vi____hal temples discussed in Part I, this understanding of the samadhi shrine as a ""living space"" dictates the manner in which the space is engaged with by its devotees over time, generating a particularized mythico-historical personality of place. In extension, I posit that the samadhi shrines of the Varkari tradition form a dynamic network of sacred sites that is anchored at its hub by the Vi____hal Temple in Pa_harpur and constitute a complex sacred geography that traverses the entire landscape of Maharashtra. ""Lord in the Temple, Lord in the Tomb"" is a sustained analysis of Hindu samadhi shrine burial practice and its relation to broader Hindu temple traditions. The study is structured as a two-part exploration of Hindu sacred space. Part I is an extended study of the development of Hindu temple traditions, from their roots in Vedic ritual structures to their full flowering in the ideology of temple design delineated in the Vastu-Shastras and Shilpa-Shastras. Central to the development of the Hindu temple is the understanding of the space as pervaded by the living presence of the deity who is housed within in the form of a murti (sculpted image). I provide a sustained analysis of two particular temple traditions, one Shaiva and one Vai_h_ava---the Minak_hi-Sundareshvara temple complex in Madurai and the Vi____hal temple compound in Pa_harpur---to illustrate how the understanding of the temple as a ""living space"" dictates the manner in which the space is interacted with over time, leading to what I call a mythico-historical personality of place. I highlight the process by which the temple space is continually re-inscribed with new layers of meaning through the devotees' repeated encounters with that space over time.",India,78.96288,20.593684,33

Religious Studies",Religious Studies,Ines Talamantez,"In addition, I interrogate categories of analysis in popular use, such as ""Indian"" and ""Indigenous Religion"", in order to arrive at a more nuanced understanding of the competing claims of biological race, cultural hybridity, and a history of forced assimilation upon native identifications. In order to more fully explore the meanings of pan-Indian and trans-Indigenous exchange, I turn to the field of Religion and Healing in Native America. The openness and welcoming of non-natives into native-controlled ceremonial spaces can be explained through an analytic of healing. Accordingly, I argue that native people have identified colonization as a pathology, both mentally and socially, from which both colonizing and colonized populations must recover. The sacred space invoked by Native American spirituality creates decolonizing spaces for the diverse multi-racial participants in that they seek to reinforce an indigenous model of knowledge and practice that resists assimilation. Community ceremonies, such as sweat lodges, function as a hub for the exchange of knowledge and for the healing of individuals and for the group as a whole. Finally, I explore the logics of contestation to change and adaptation within the ceremonies themselves. Tension inevitably arises between fidelity to a sacred tradition and adaptations deemed necessary by the change in context from reservation to diverse city. In these cases, racial identity determines religious authority, where those with a greater degree of perceived ""Indianness"" express more freedom to improvise and adapt in challenging conditions. Whereas among those without biological claim to an indigenous identity, emphasis is centered around performing and interpreting the traditional protocol in a strict manner. This case study in an American Indian urban diaspora community proposes a new model of indigeneity incorporating outsiders, extending the religious boundary, and circulating knowledge without losing an authentic connection to tradition and homeland. In 2014, more than 70% of American Indians live in urban areas away from reservations. This dissertation employs theoretical work on diaspora religion to interpret the effects on spiritual practices of the displacement of Native Americans to cities since the mid-20th century. Using the framework of an urban diaspora, I argue that the split geographical situation results in a center-satellite formation of pan-Indian religion in which Lakota practices are dominant. Employing ethnographic fieldwork among a diverse group practicing Native American spirituality in Ventura County, California, I argue that such urban spiritual networks balance competing forces of indigenizing versus extending within the larger pan-Indian religious community. That is, as Lakota spiritual practices were gradually opened to non-Lakota, and even non-Indian, outsiders, the traditional protocols that govern the ceremonial structure have become more important in ensuring the continuance of an authorized, traditional religion. I trace the logic of assimilation through the relevant history of Native American forced dislocations and urbanization---from 19th century removal policies, prisoner-of- war camps, to compulsory boarding schools for Indian youth, to the Termination and ix Relocation policies of the United States government in the decades after World War II. These migrations and policies of de-culturization contribute to the historical context for a study of mixed-blood natives and non-natives practicing intertribal, Lakota-based spirituality in coastal California from the 1970's to the present.",India,78.96288,20.593684,33

Religious Studies",Religious Studies,Vesna A. Wallace,"In this dissertation, I explore the way in which early Buddhists formed their own self-identity vis-a-vis Vedic Brahmans. Interestingly, while today we understand Buddhism and Hinduism as separate religions, and Brahmans as belonging to the latter religion, early Buddhist texts frequently refer to the Buddha, his enlightened disciples, or just the ""ideal person"" in the abstract as Brahmans. Many previous scholars have argued or assumed that the category ""Brahman"" was a term that belonged properly to the ""Brahmanical tradition,"" whose roots long pre-date Buddhism, and thus concluded that early Buddhist uses of the word Brahman (brahman&dotbelow;a) should be interpreted as ""borrowings"" from the Brahmanical tradition, made for the purpose of polemic. I, however, argue that the word Brahman was a contested category that was not ""owned"" by a monolithic Brahmanical tradition and then borrowed by Buddhists to use polemically, but that it was a common honorific term that was actively contested by both Buddhists and (Vedic) Brahmans and only with time ceded by the former to the latter. In making this argument, I make use of a wide variety of early South Asian sources, including Brahmanical texts, inscriptions, and early Buddhist texts preserved in Pali, Sanskrit, Chinese, and Tibetan. In the first part of my dissertation, I show that while there was a common vocabulary for describing religious practitioners in ancient India, Buddhist and Brahmanical texts deployed them differently in an effort to construct a unique and superior identity for their own respective ideals. Then, in the second part, I argue that the earliest Buddhist literature makes use of the word brahman&dotbelow;a (""Brahman"") simply as an honorific for the ideal person, while later elaborations on this usage convert this simple honorific into a polemic against the Vedic Brahmans, who are depicted as unworthy of the name by which they call themselves. Finally, in the third part of my dissertation, I examine texts that I refer to as ""encounter dialogs""---texts in which the Buddha encounters an interlocutor who is identified as a Brahman, and argue that through the implicit narrative structure of these texts, Buddhists effectively ceded the category ""Brahman.""",India,78.96288,20.593684,33

Religious Studies",Religious Studies,Barbara A. Holdrege,"This dissertation examines interactions and exchanges between Khrist Bhaktas, Catholics, and Hindus in the Banaras region of eastern Uttar Pradesh, in a study that is ethnographic, historical, and comparative. At the center of the study are the religious adherents known as Khrist Bhaktas, or devotees of Christ. The community, constituted by Dalits and Other Backward Classes (OBCs), are eighty-five percent women and are found mostly in the villages of the Banaras region. Matr&dotbelow; Dham asram (Abode of the Mother) is the movement's geographical locus, situated six kilometers from the Varan&dotbelow;asi Cantonment. Operating under the auspices of the indigenous Catholic Indian Missionary Society (IMS), since the 1970s the asram has been a center of indigenizing Indian Catholicism, and more recently, has served as an influential node in the charismatic Catholic movement in north India, which arrived in Banaras in the early 1990s. It is argued that the Khrist Bhaktas arise out of the historic encounters between Hindus and Christians in South Asia over the last two millennia. As such, their connection to that broader history is examined. It is further argued that the Khrist Bhaktas are most fruitfully interpreted as a hybrid community constituted by the coalescing of Hindu bhakti (devotion), popular or vernacular Hinduism, and charismatic Catholicism. Each of these religious modes are explored in detail, by recourse to religious history, Hindu and Christian scriptures and theology, and social theory. Because the Khrist Bhaktas embody the community's status as ""in-between"" Catholics and Hindus, their examination allows us to interrogate fixed notions of religious identities. For reasons both theological and political, the Khrist Bhaktas have yet to be baptized into full communion with the Catholic Church, thus they remain outside its traditional sacramental life and the so-called ""means of grace."" This has not stopped the communities in question from negotiating other means of encounter with Jesus, the Virgin Mary, and the saints. Negotiation, we find, is the through line for this study, but it is far from certain how or if these negotiations will continue.

Theater Studies",Theater Studies,Christina McMahon,"Between 1997 and 2001, Shakespeare's Globe Theatre invited troupes from South Africa, Cuba, India, Brazil, and Japan to present translations of Shakespearean plays on its London stage. Known as the ""Globe to Globe"" series, this set of productions received ambivalent and sometimes condescending reviews from British critics who did not understand the translation languages or performance conventions. Taking these reviews to encapsulate the productions' reception, scholars have agreed that the series reinforced hegemonic hierarchies between spectators and performers. They argue that the displacement to London rendered the performances' original meanings unintelligible; further, that this dislocation stimulated national superiority in British spectators who measured the performances against their expectations of Shakespeare and their tourist-like desires to witness an exotic Other. However, this perspective obscures both the agency of the performers as participants in the encounter and the diversity of audience response, presenting a fatalistic view of touring performance. I argue that that in a performance across language and culture, failures in understanding do not indicate the failure of the event; rather, they can provoke spectators to suspend their preconceptions and negotiate new relationships. Reading professional reviews against the grain and placing them in conversation with video records and other documentation of the mass audiences' reactions, I suggest that the productions subverted the tourist gaze by resisting easy comprehension. As translation and 'foreign' performance conventions reshaped famous texts, the productions undermined audiences' expectations of both Shakespeare and the culture onstage. Confronted with the limits of their knowledge, spectators improvised new strategies of viewing, learning habits of listening and questioning that challenged cultural hierarchies. These events further undermined dominant power dynamics by attracting audiences from London's diasporic communities and privileging their knowledge and reactions over those of the normative British spectator. This trend intensified in 2012, when the Globe to Globe concept was revived as a massive festival for audiences containing many translation-language speakers. Through spectator surveys, I show that the 2012 performances contributed to a shift in the norms of mainstream London theatre, challenging the centrality of English as the standard for both Shakespearean performance and the source of audience privilege.",India,78.96288,20.593684,33

Economics",Economics,Peter Kuhn,"This dissertation consists of three essays in development economics in three different national contexts. The first essay explores the productivity differential between return migrants (""Sea Turtles"") and non-migrants through a case study of China's venture capital (VC) industry. I find that even after correcting for selection bias, return venture capitalists are less productive than comparable non-migrants in targeting promising projects and/or providing value-added services. Given that the VC industry is a useful laboratory in which to look at the performance of return migrants and China's economic development, I discuss why the presumably better human capital accumulated overseas does not translate into productivity in the Chinese market, and how related policies could reverse this situation in the long run. The second essay exploits panel data and large, abrupt, and unusual dislocations of Indonesian workers in the wake of the Asian Financial Crisis to investigate the robustness and persistence of inter-industry wage differentials (IWDs). Unobserved worker characteristics explain 36% of IWDs. IWDs persist through the post-crisis decade, although, consistent with a rent-sharing explanation, they shift alongside sectors' terms of trade in the wake of the crisis. Agriculture pays a wage penalty, and manufacturing sector a statistically significant but small premium. Most IWDs do not seem to be driven by minimum wage laws, worker monitoring costs, the disagreeability of the work, job-specific skills, industry-specific human capital, non-wage benefits or contracting terms. In the third essay, the author examines the reduced-form relationship between the venture capital (VC) penetration and the embodied technological change (through the growth of capital services) and the disembodied technological change (through the growth of the total factor productivity (TFP)) at the sectoral level in the US. Combining various datasets from EU-KLEMS, PwC MoneyTree Report and STAN and applying various econometric strategies suitable for dynamic panel data, the author finds that the VC accessibility is positively associated with the capital service/TFP growth contemporarily, but that it is negatively correlated with them in the following years.",Indonesia,113.921327,-0.789275,3

However, during the 20th and 21st centuries, as international development processes and hegemonic global norms have been increasingly disseminated through the processes of globalization, the Western medical model for birthing has spread around the globe (Davis-Floyd, 1997; Jordan, 1978). This thesis asks what the global potentials are for humanized birth as a means to reduce maternal mortality in a women-centered way. Through the collection of birth stories from 13 women who birthed at the Yayasan Bumi Sehat Birth Clinic in Bali, Indonesia at the end 2011, the value of the humanized birth model is explored as it contrasts the Western, technocratic, medical model of birth (Bumi Sehat Foundation, 2012; Davis- Floyd, 200; Umenai et al. 2001; Wagner, 2001). In this thesis, women's stories are valued as research evidence with particular relevance to policy guidance in support of the humanized birthing method (Carolan, 2006; VandeVusse, 1999).",Indonesia,113.921327,-0.789275,3

Political Science",Political Science,Benjamin J. Cohen,"This dissertation examines the negotiation processes of financial and monetary cooperation in East Asia since the 1997--1998 Asian financial crisis, which have been understudied. The purpose of this study is to explore the various strategies and tactics that helped to shape particular agreement details, in order to provide more insight to our understanding of the dynamics of international economic negotiations. Since the conventional three levels of analysis of International Relations cannot tell which specific outcome may be selected, a problem of multiple equilibria results. I contend that negotiators' bargaining strategies and tactics can solve a multiple equilibria problem as they help explain the specific details of outcomes. This research uses the recent agreement to multilateralize the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMIM), with particular emphasis on the issues of members' financial contributions and vote shares, to analyze negotiation processes. Due to data inaccessibility problems and financial constraints, I chose to focus on five of the most influential players in the CMIM negotiations---Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. It should be noted that China, though it was an important actor in the CMIM negotiations, is not included in my analysis due to a lack of direct access to Chinese sources. Extensive archival research and in-depth interviews were employed to collect data. Process tracing was a method of analysis. My investigation of the CMIM negotiations reveals that the member states employed several bargaining elements to alter final outcome. States with a lower discount rate (a lower sense of urgency) and a more attractive best alternative to no agreement (batna) were able to walk away with more favorable terms than those with a higher discount rate and less attractive batna. Also, possessing knowledge about other actors' preferences or about issues being discussed (expertise) enhanced states' relative bargaining leverage. Countries took advantage of being a co-chair of the negotiation to turn the agreement terms in their favor. In some circumstances, countries strategically linked issues under negotiation to reap concessions from the others. Additionally, forming a coalition or preventing a coalition of other states from forming sometimes helped states achieve their objectives.",Indonesia,113.921327,-0.789275,3

I examine four sets of love stories that &grave;Attar used in his writings to comment on issues of law, transgression, human diversity and inclusiveness. From literature to modern theory, this dissertation explores the reasons for &grave;Attar's inclusion of peripheral individuals in his works, and it integrates literary theory and a comparative medieval European perspective. Applying modern theoretical notions to medieval society, which produced its own perspectives on life, religion, society, and culture, might appear anachronistic; however, it is essential to inquire whether modern insights about these notions can help us better understand medieval works, or whether these ideas are exclusive to early modern and modern relations. Without such an analysis, we are left with an inadequate understanding of medieval culture and literature. Previous scholarship has investigated similar comparative notions in works such as Ibn al- &grave;Arabi's and Rumi's. However, research on &grave;Attar's works from a modern theoretical perspective in a comparative context has been limited. My study remedies this gap in the literature by examining the ways through which &grave;Attar engages with these modern notions. It shows that whereas members of minority populations are not fully integrated in modern Iranian society, inclusiveness was thinkable in the medieval period by extraordinary Sufi writers such as &grave;Attar. Throughout, I argue that &grave;Attar portrays his submission to the divine by accepting and embracing human diversity through Sufism and love of the divine. His works, Tadhkirat al-Awliya, Ilahi-nama, Musibat-nama and Mantiq al-Tayr, are precious for they show that inclusiveness was thinkable in the medieval period. This project illustrates that &grave;Attar's explorations of medieval inter-subjectivity are significant for our understanding of subjectivity in a modern world. It introduces new readings of &grave;Attar's works and encourages explorations of new possibilities, which can dismantle established narratives of our present experience and (mis)perceptions about human diversity and minorities.",Iran,53.688046,32.427908,5

History",History,R. Stephen Humphreys,"Outside of Iran, Muslims denigrated Zoroastrians through unflattering comparisons. They likened Zoroastrians to Vikings, Qadarites, and other groups perceived as unfamiliar, pagan, or heretical. Such comparisons, made by Muslims who had little experience with actual Zoroastrians, were highly rhetorical and intended for internal consumption. Like tales of fire temple desecration, they ultimately facilitated the construction of the Muslims' own communal identity. Therefore, not even the harsh Islamic discourse validates the lachrymose narrative of Zoroastrian history. Rather, the existence of competing Muslim discourses about Zoroastrians reveals the contested, contingent, and contextual nature of Muslim-Zoroastrian relations in early Islamic history. This dissertation treats Muslim-Zoroastrian relations between the seventh and eleventh centuries. It challenges the lachrymose narrative of Zoroastrian history, which overemphasizes the role of religious violence in precipitating the decline of Zoroastrianism after the Islamic conquest of Iran. This gloomy narrative is a product of Orientalist tropes, polemical historiographies about the treatment of dhimmis and the effect of the Islamic conquest, the apocalyptic tenor of medieval Zoroastrian sources, and concerns about the status of Zoroastrians in modern Iran and India. Scholars of Zoroastrianism and Iranian languages have written most of the secondary literature on this topic, despite the fact that most of the primary sources were written by Muslims in Arabic. Since few Islamicists have studied Muslim-Zoroastrian relations, the lachrymose narrative persists. However, there was a harsh Islamic discourse about Zoroastrians. Local histories of Iranian cities are replete with tales of fire temple desecration. Medieval Muslim historians in South Asia often invented tales of Hindu temple desecration as part of a triumphal narrative of religious supersession. Iranian historians did likewise. Although there are a few credible accounts of temple desecration, the secondary literature too often fails to properly contextualize them. These attacks, when considered in context, do not seem to have been motivated primarily by religious animus. The scale and religious significance of fire temple desecration has been exaggerated. There are two competing discourses about Zoroastrians in the early Islamic sources---one accommodating, the other harsh. The accommodating discourse, embedded in reports about the conduct of the Prophet Muhammad, urged Muslims to tax Zoroastrians and, later, to treat them like People of the Book. Abbasid scribes attempted to relieve Zoroastrians of particular legal disabilities by forging the 'ahd-nama, a charter of religious freedom that the Prophet Muhammad supposedly issued to the descendants of Salman al-Farisi. This charter, which belongs to several genres of Islamic literature, probably had a Muslim author. It indicates that there were hybrid religious sympathies in early Islamic Iran, which challenges the lachrymose narrative of Zoroastrian history.",Iran,53.688046,32.427908,5

This project further explores the degree to which female activists draw on Shi'i jurisprudence and the Iranian Constitution to authenticate their arguments on gender justice. In an effort to come to a better understanding of contemporary women's activism in Iran, I conducted a case study of a prominent Muslim women's coalition named E'telaf-I Islamiyyih Zanan (Women's Islamic Coalition). This organization promotes women's empowerment, gender justice, and policy reform through faith-based jurisprudence. By using a multidisciplinary approach, the dissertation explores the evolving roles of women as religious authorities and producers of religious knowledge, addressing how their scholarship challenges patriarchal interpretations of Islamic scriptures. Through this case study, much of the juristic debates and the gridlocks of modernity and modern states' struggle with traditional family organization are brought to light, and the questions of how women are negotiating tradition with modernity become more conspicuous. More broadly, this dissertation provides a nuanced analysis of the ways in which women's religious activism and authority impacts policy reform and women's empowerment.

Political Science",Political Science,Bruce Bimber,"These results reveal the small window of opportunity protesters have to attract public support before news attention wanes and underscore the importance of protester tactics in shaping the narratives of coverage. Protesters have to strategically weigh the costs of confrontational tactics because such tactics can elicit more news attention to the protest, but these tactics might overshadow the core message of the protest itself. To identify the frame-changing dynamic occurring over time, I conducted a content analysis of the news coverage of Occupy Wall Street and the G20 protests in London, Pittsburgh and Toronto. The study identifies longitudinal changes in news frames about the substantive issues of a protest and the conflict that ensues between protesters and city officials during a protest. Findings suggest that conflict has a significant impact on the number of news stories about protests. Further, the results demonstrate how news framing opportunities change as a movement reaches different stages of the news attention cycle. The cases studied here illustrate that when the protests grew, journalists focused on the protesters' grievances, including economic inequality, bank bailouts, ending the Iraq War, and climate change. As the movements peaked, news attention shifted to the intensifying conflict between city officials and protesters. Ultimately, prolonged conflict is typically followed by a decline in protest news interest. When protests are successful, they force us to realize another world is possible. To be successful they have to communicate their message effectively and be persuasive. News coverage can often determine whether a protest will be successful or unsuccessful at amplifying its message and persuading audiences. This dissertation examines the relationship of news organizations and protest movements. It asks three primary research questions. First, how does news attention to a protest rise and fall over time? Second, do news organizations pay attention to the causes and grievances of protesters? Third, how does news framing of a protest change over time? To answer these questions, I develop a theoretical model, the protest news framing cycle, and present the results of a longitudinal analysis of news attention and framing of protest movements.",Iraq,43.6793,33.2232,2

Combined with the sectarian polices of the occupation, these factors fueled sectarian conflict in Iraq. This study posits that one of the central goals of invading Iraq was to integrate the country into the global economy. The radical neoliberal policies and the light-speed at which the occupation administration implemented these policies are evidence of the centrality of this goal to U.S. objectives. The American occupation of Iraq built a neoliberal state whose aim was its full integration within transnational circuits of capital accumulation. This inverted the state-capitalist class relations by subordinating the Iraqi state to the interests of the transnational capitalist class and the emerging local faction of that class. Global Capitalism and Political Control: Investigating the Invasion and Occupation of Iraq explores state and elite formation within the current structures of global capitalism through a rigorous study of Iraq in the period between the 2003 U.S. invasion and 2012. Based on fieldwork conducted in 2005 and 2009, it traces the intent and strategies of the U.S. administration in Iraq by examining laws implemented, agreements signed with and on behalf of the Iraqi government, contracts awarded, and policies that were favored and lobbied for in Iraq. It also examines extensive reports published by the Iraqi government, the U.S. government, international financial institutions, and various other international governing institutions and non-governmental organizations.",Iraq,43.6793,33.2232,2

The coterie of poets I study are termed the Soundeye poets after their regular attendance at the annual Cork-based Soundeye Poetry Festival; the poets are Billy Mills, Catherine Walsh, Maurice Scully, Randolph Healy, and Trevor Joyce, all of whom draw inspiration from the radical forces of international Modernism and the historical avant-garde in their formal choices and in their attempts to revamp poetry to reflect the globalized Ireland in which they live. In the last half of the twentieth century, the Republic of Ireland turned away from isolationist policies and an agrarian economy to embrace the European community and the global market, which led to the economic boom of the late 1990s and early 2000s termed the ""Celtic Tiger."" My dissertation argues that the Soundeye poets reveal and critique, not only in content, but also in poetic form, the societal consequences of privatization and basement-level corporate taxes.

Music",Music,Scott L. Marcus,"Milwaukee, Wisconsin, boasts a vibrant Irish traditional music and dance community. Spurred on by a strong dance scene, numerous pub sessions, the cultural and educational influence of Milwaukee Irish Fest and its Summer School, and the transnational circulation of performers and audio recordings, local traditional musicians have developed considerable skills, as well as strong personal and collective styles. In a number of cases, musicians associate themselves, through the style and repertoire of their playing, with specific regional styles of traditional music in Ireland, such as those of County Donegal or Sliabh Luachra (Counties Cork and Kerry). It is remarkable, however, that with perhaps only a single exception, these musicians are not from the areas with which they stylistically associate themselves or even from Ireland itself. Rather, they are for the most part natives of Southeastern Wisconsin who have been introduced to Irish traditional music in the context of late 20 th century revival movements. How then have they come to associate themselves with localized performance styles from Ireland? This thesis analyzes these stylistic associations in terms of the repertory requirements of local dancing, opportunities to hear and be educated in regional styles by visiting musicians, and the availability of stylistically diverse audio recordings. This paper speaks to the ways in which local musics are globalized, but then socially re-localized through affinity-based musical practices, and is based on my extended local involvement as a musician from 2004 onwards, as well as ethnographic fieldwork from 2009 to 2010.",Ireland,-7.6920536,53.1423672,4

Drawing upon the work of Eric Hobsbawm and Roland Barthes, I argue that murals played a key role in the invention of traditions, a process of crafting a communal self-identification and legitimizing central narrative, which was of crucial concern to groups on both sides. In this regard, murals functioned as a form of mythic speech, attempting to depoliticize and make natural the rhetoric used by the competing groups. Murals served as a highly visible form of both internal and external propaganda, articulating one side's rhetoric while challenging the other's. The grassroots nature of the mural traditions is particularly telling, exposing the deep-seated insecurity of both sides. This insecurity was further reflected by, and a served as a catalyst for, the paramilitary violence that has been a defining characteristic of Northern Ireland for so long.",Ireland,-7.6920536,53.1423672,4

There is a belief, backed by some research coming out of public mental health facilities in Jerusalem, that the religious community underutilizes traditional mental health resources (Rosen, Greenberg, Schmeidler & Shefler, 2008). The conclusion of the research proposes that the underutilization is likely due to stigma within the community. This study addresses the question: What is the process that Orthodox Jewish English-speaking immigrants in the Jerusalem community use to seek help in times of emotional stress? The study addresses both barriers and facilitators to resources for this community. A qualitative, constructivist grounded theory approach was used in the collection and analysis of 26 interviews. Standards of trustworthiness as outlined by Morrow (2005) were used to ensure the rigor of the study. The result is an attachment theory-informed, nine-stage cyclical model of help-seeking as well as in-depth descriptive information about individuals' unique and culturally specific experience of the nine stages. Factors such as individuals' help-seeking filters, structural barriers (mainly transportation and cost) as well as community emphasis on privacy and therapist value-match are some of the barriers identified by participants as important in their help-seeking processes; these findings indicate a more complex explanation and understanding of why this population may not use government-funded resources.

Film and Media Studies",Film and Media Studies,Michael Curtin,"How does hope emerge amidst a hopeless situation, freedom amidst apartheid, equality amidst inequality? In the context of Palestine, where is utopian located? A possible answer to these enigmas presented itself in a Freedom March organized by a group of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron in March 2013. Carrying Palestinian flags, they crossed into a forbidden zone, boldly walking into the section of the street designated for Jewish settlers only. On their faces were masks of Martin Luther King, Jr., in their hands were portraits of Rosa Parks, and on their shirts were four English words: ""I have a dream"". By resurrecting the imagery and iconography of the US Black Freedom Movement, these Palestinians were drawing new, imaginative constellations of counterhegemonic protest and forging transnational links of solidarity across time and space. The demonstrators thus staged a disruption. They temporarily interrupted the status quo and transgressed the rules and regulations of the hegemonic order. As a result, they were swiftly apprehended by uniformed members of the Israeli Defense Forces. As if to reenact a scene from Birmingham or Selma, the soldiers ripped the flags from the protesters' hands and placed them in handcuffs. With MLK masks still on their faces, the demonstrators were loaded onto trucks and quickly taken out of sight. The protest was thus brought to a halt almost as soon as it had begun. In this way, an attempt was made to contain the disruption, to restore the ruling regime of hierarchy and segregation, and to sew up the tear that the demonstrators had ripped in the symbolic universe. But while the protesters themselves could be forcibly removed from the scene, the images they left behind could not be so easily erased. Photographs of the demonstration were immediately published on the Internet and circulated on social media websites. Like apparitions from another dimension, these images demonstrate that another world is possible, a world without ethnic- or religious-determined divisions, a world without apartheid walls, security fences, or segregated streets. They show that the unthinkable can be made thinkable, that the invisible can be made visible, and that the impossible can be made possible. This staged news spectacle represents just one example of a larger trend. In Equality in the Shadows, I look at the role of film, media, and culture in the Palestinian struggle against Zionist colonization. Basing my dissertation on both Edward Said's notion of ""the Palestinian Idea"" and Jacques Ranciere's subversive redefinition of equality, I aim to show how through film and media, Palestinian liberation is not only a dream for a far-off and distant future but something that already exists in the present.

Many scholars studying the Jewish diaspora continue the prevalent understanding of physical homecoming to the Land as a fait accompli, which, according to some interpretations, prohibits creativity and presupposes an already achieved redemption. This approach, however, misunderstands the calls for continued alienation and separation, regardless of location, thus denying access to more ways in which diaspora exists. By employing the theoretical frameworks of the chronotope (time-space literary analysis), as well as threshold and liminal moments, I delve into the possibilities for uncovering recollections and making present unanticipated memories as offered at such moments of confrontation (with the Land, with a sight, a smell, a sound, etc.). Such individual and collective confrontation destabilizes that which has become taken-for-granted and thus renews creativity. When applied to Israeli reflections on intergenerational belonging and outlook, while acknowledging physical emplacement, a tension results from the inability of succeeding generations to identify with and recount the motivations and passions of previous generations. Through writing from the situation of emplacement, we see societal cleavages, continued alienation, and renewed separation. Through an exploration of these gaps we are left asking the same questions of living individuals as we did of literature: ""To what shall one commit, and how shall one commit, if at all?"" The resulting intentional separation of confrontation that we see in these works makes the quotidian extraordinary and the already achieved something to be anticipated.

Sociology",Sociology,Kum-Kum Bhavnani,"The deployment of tourism to strengthen diaspora ties is well documented, however sociologists have yet to examine the use of tourism to complicate transnational diaspora allegiances. Jewish tourism to the Palestinian Territories offers a compelling case to study this growing trend, as more non-Israeli Jews are foregoing standard trips to Israel and instead visiting sites in Israel/Palestine that challenge dominant Zionist narratives. Using a mixed methods approach that combines pre/post tour surveys with longitudinal in-depth interviews, I investigate how this emerging form of tourism shapes participants' political views, identities, and activism. I find that tourists often experience significant ideological tension when they criticize a base country, while still seeing themselves as part of its national collective. However, rather than compel participants to sever their ties to the base country (Israel), this tension can actually lead to increased engagement on the part of the diaspora member, even when it is in the form of activism directed against the state. Jewish tourism to the Palestinian Territories appears to facilitate this kind of diasporic tension, while also causing participants to ""humanize"" a previously demonized population, Palestinians. Though such ""humanization"" does not always lead to overt changes in political views, it influences participants' willingness to embrace counter national narratives. These results suggest that this unique form of ""homeland"" tourism can engender political criticism within diaspora populations, while simultaneously solidifying transnational ties. It is this contradictory process - solidifying ties to a base country while promoting political criticism of it - that I discuss in my thesis.",Israel,34.851612,31.046051,6

Sociology",Sociology,Avery F. Gordon,"West Bank Public Transportation: Movement as Politics is a study of mobility via public transportation as an important object of social struggle and the social mobilization that can result from creative engagements with transit. In Palestine, public transportation has and continues to be used as a way for Israeli occupation forces to impose social control on Palestinians. At the same time, Palestinians use transit in both intentionally political and quotidian ways to build connections and community despite the occupation's efforts to fragment Palestinian society. Against a shattered topography of walls, tunnels, gates, and checkpoints, transit becomes the stage on which battles for territorial sovereignty, social cohesion, dignity, and human rights play out. While scholars have written about the structural impediments to Palestinian movement and the social fractures that result, they have not focused specifically on transit as a strategic instrument for state imposition of separation and grassroots efforts to connect. I contribute such a focus on public transportation as both my direct object of study--I examine its characteristics, structures, and usages as a system--and as a lens through which to better understand the changing economic, political, and racial nature of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Focusing on key episodes in the history of Palestine in which public transportation has played a significant role, I draw on critical theory, political sociology and social movements scholarship with international legal studies, cultural geography, and critical race theory. Based on ten months of mixed-methods fieldwork in Palestine, I present an analysis of the political dimensions of public transportation control and usage in the late Ottoman period (1892-1918), the British Mandate (1920-1948), the first Palestinian intifada (1987-1993), the Oslo years (1993-2000), the second Palestinian intifada (2000-2008), and the present-day West Bank. This socio-historical approach to the study highlights the value of transit for the imposition but also the bridging of geographic fragmentation in Palestine. An examination of mobility through the specific lens of transit reveals a uniquely nuanced picture of the strengths of state power as well as the limits imposed on it by popular mobility. My findings indicate that transit has been a useful tool in furthering various colonial and national aspirations over the last 120 years, enabling some and undermining others based on who exerts or subverts control over transit and how they do so. I relate my findings to international law to illustrate the importance of the universal human right to freedom of movement for the functioning of everyday life, how that right is routinely violated, and the ways in which people register explicit and implicit demands for that right to be restored. Finally, I argue that any productive resolution to the colonial affliction of Palestinian life must prioritize the unfettered mobility of Palestinians across Palestine.",Israel,34.851612,31.046051,6

French and Italian",French and Italian,"Jon R. Snyder, Jody Enders","In exploring the use of specific units of French farce in Tuscan comedy, this study aims to elucidate the ways in which a revised poetics of imitation within select experimental literary academies of the Renaissance not only favored the transgression of classical models but also triggered the explosive growth of hybrid genres. Finally, intercalation of French farce in Italian comedy sheds new light on the integration of Renaissance Italian theatrical culture in France at the end of the sixteenth century and raises issues of ""international relations"" in the field of theatrical studies. This study analyzes the experimental use of units of theater from the medieval French farce tradition in Pierantonio Stricca Legacci's Cilombrino (1518), Salvestro Cartaio's Il Travaglio (The Torment) (1552), and Antonfrancesco Grazzini's L'Arzigogolo (The Quibble) (c. 1580). It asks questions such as: Did French military presence in Italy or the substantial Italian population in France have a specific effect on the theatrical productions of the sixteenth century? For what reasons would the French farce have appealed to experimental Tuscan literary academies of the sixteenth century, and how would Tuscan playwrights have come into contact with the French genre? In what ways were units of farce appropriated as models of progressive theater for and by these academies? Finally, what role did politics play in the comedic creations of the sixteenth-century theater? Could only laughter speak the truth to power as embodied by the French monarchy and the Medici regime? How did this hybrid comic theater critique the conventions of humanist imitation? By examining the formal relationships between medieval French farce and Italian Renaissance comedy through close investigation of thematic and textual borrowings, as well as stagecraft, this study authenticates Tuscan comedy as a ""contact zone"" for transalpine intercultural exchange, involving both material exchanges (print, letters, staging features, audio-visual effects) and semiotic ones (symbols, themes, topoi). The French farce appealed to the experimental, avant-garde Tuscan dramatists of the sixteenth century as a model from which to appropriate a new kind of comic theater. Through the intercalation of Tuscan drama with the French farce, playwrights of the Congrega dei Rozzi in Siena and the Accademia degli Umidi in Florence created some of the first examples of hybrid genres of early modern theater; this intertextual phenomenon continued to gain popularity throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. By probing the connection between politics and the French farce, I show how inimitably suited this genre was to the needs of sixteenth-century Tuscan dramatists. This theatrical tradition allowed for the representation of key social tensions and contradictions that humanist comedy may otherwise have been unable to express theatrically without threatening to disrupt and undermine social stability. With an emphasis on interaction of theatrical forms, as well as a focus on the social, cultural, and historical factors that influenced these cultural productions, this dissertation offers a socio-semiotic reading of the construction of early modern European comedy, particularly in regard to humanism, imitation, and international cultural exchange.",Italy,12.56738,41.87194,12

History",History,Carol Lansing,"In this dissertation, I examine maritime predation conducted by and against the people of Genoa, Italy during the long twelfth century: 1100-1215 CE. Maritime predation, or piracy, was an endemic phenomenon in the medieval Mediterranean, but very little scholarship exists on the subject. In this study I demonstrate that rich documentation on virtually every aspect of maritime predation exist, both in narrative sources, and in notarial and diplomatic records housed in the Archivio di Stato in Genoa, and that maritime predation was a licit, and even celebrated activity in the period under investigation that involved a wide array of actors, both on the land and sea. I show that Maritime predation in twelfth-century Genoa was both an industry in its own right, and an integral part of the fabric of Genoese society. The importance of this activity to the cities that practiced and were victimized by it has been greatly underestimated by scholars. My study aims to rectify that, and to suggest new avenues for the study of maritime violence and predation. In Chapter One, I investigate the context of maritime predation in twelfth-century Genoa. I first describe the nature of the sources that are available for studying Genoese life in this period, and discuss both the interpretive limitations and possibilities that these sources offer. I also investigate the emergence, structure, and evolution of Genoa's communal government, which began to take shape at the beginning of the twelfth century. I argue that the precocious documentary culture emerged in Genoa, with its strong emphasis on record-keeping, served to meet the unique needs of a society heavily engaged in long-term collaborative investments and overseas trade. As a result, a wealth of documentation exists from this period, which makes the study of maritime predation, commerce, and many other aspects of daily life in the city possible. In Chapter Two, I investigate how normal commerce functioned in Genoa, and focus on the activities along Genoa's waterfront district, the Ripa Maris. I show that commerce was not just the activity of handful of travelling merchants, but that it involved men and women from all walks of life, working together as investors, harvesters, manufacturers, shop-owners, ship-builders and so forth. I also discuss the various regions with which the Genoese traded, and demonstrate that Genoa played a special role in commerce between various Muslim regions of the Mediterranean. Finally, I investigate both the Genoese participation in the Crusades, and their long-held hostility towards the neighboring Pisans, and argue that the Genoese sense of enmity was very different from what traditional narratives of faith relations in the medieval Mediterranean might lead one to expect. In Chapter Three, I discuss the historiography of piracy/maritime predation in the medieval Mediterranean, and examine exactly what kinds of documentation exist on the subject. I argue that it is actually inaccurate to use the term ""piracy"" in this context, as maritime predation was a licit activity, regulated by the government, and taxed by the archbishop, traditional commerce was. I also demonstrate that the vocabulary used in Genoese sources to discuss predation was the same terminology that was used for the terrestrial hunt. I finally investigate the kinds of ships that records indicate were used in maritime predation, and argue that the medieval Genoese boasted a far more varied arsenal of tools for predation than the scholarship has previously indicated. In Chapter Four, I examine a series of notarial contracts for the outfitting of predatory voyages, and break down the many steps that the process entailed. Through these contracts, I demonstrate that maritime predation was conducted as a highly-collaborative business venture that involved numerous investors, contractors, and other personnel, and that the contracts used to orchestrate these voyages were the same as those used to organize traditional commerce. I also identify many of the individuals who were engaged in maritime predation, and show that both members of the laboring classes and Genoa's elite frequently engaged in this activity, and that it was, in fact, members of the elite who were most often found organizing major predatory voyages. In Chapter Five, I discuss the targets of maritime predation, and the various methods that were used to try and prevent predation. I analyze the locations where maritime predation frequently took place, and argue that local knowledge and the ongoing collection of intelligence by sea captains were both integral to keeping ships safe. I also explore some of the methods that the commune used to prevent the capture of Genoese ships, and argue that just as Genoa's elites were often responsible for organizing and engaging in predation, they were also obliged to provide for the protection of merchant vessels. I also show that it is virtually impossible to draw a line between where defensive patrolling ended and offensive predation began. In Chapter Six, I discuss the tactics utilized by maritime predators, themselves, which is a topic that has not been addressed for this period. I demonstrate that predators had a wide variety of tactics at their disposal, and that elaborate networks existed for relaying information about the movement of ships. I discuss the identification of ships at sea through the use of flags and other signals, and the dangers of false identifications. I finally discuss a number of less common forms of maritime predation, including the commandeering of ships and cargoes from ports, which were considered predatory by contemporaries. Throughout this chapter, I demonstrate that a vast array of actors, working on both land and sea, were involved in maritime predation, and that it was a highly collaborative activity that linked people together, even as it divided them. In Chapter Seven, I conclude my investigation with an epilogue that analyzes changes in maritime predation around the turn of the thirteenth century. I demonstrate that the advent of a new kind of armed sailing ship revolutionized both normal commerce and maritime predation, resulting in a kind of medieval arms race at sea. I argue that this kind of advance shows that, while many aspects of seafaring may have remained constant throughout the Age of Sail, maritime predation was a highly contextual phenomenon that varied greatly depending on the political, social, and technological context. This, maritime predation it is a subject that must be studied carefully, and in context.",Italy,12.56738,41.87194,12

History",History,Carol Lansing,"Throughout most of the twentieth century, historians of Medieval European Jewish communities overlooked the contributions of Jewish women to their families and to their communities. Recently, historians of northern European and Spanish Jews have begun to utilize notarial records to describe the financial activities of Jewish women in the Middle Ages. Yet few historians have utilized documents of practice to examine the activities of Jews in medieval or Renaissance Italy. Those few who have focus almost exclusively on the larger centers of Rome and Venice, which while important, do not represent the more typical and much smaller Jewish communities scattered throughout northern and central Italy in this period. This dissertation aims to address this oversight, and thus examines the economic roles played by Jewish women in the central Italian town of Perugia in the later Middle Ages and Renaissance. Notarial evidence reveals that by the fifteenth century, Jewish women not only possessed their own property, they managed it, alienated it, and gave it away as personal bequests in their wills. They also acted as heads-of-households in the absence of their husbands, and participated in decisions concerning family property, engaged publically in banking, and interacted with non-Jewish men in regards to business affairs. In Perugia, this was a new development. Why did it develop when it did? And what did this mean for women's position within their families and their community? By placing my analysis of these notarial records against the political backdrop of late medieval and Renaissance Perugia and within a discussion of normative rabbinic literature, I explore how this practice---female financial autonomy within the family---can be understood as a tool that aided the family's and community's struggle, and developed in response to a increasingly unstable political and social environment in Renaissance Perugia. Thus this study contributes not only to historians' understandings of this small yet important Jewish community, but also to our knowledge of the contributions Jewish women made to these communities, contributions that often far exceeded the expectations---or desires---of late antique and medieval rabbis.",Italy,12.56738,41.87194,12

History of Art and Architecture",History of Art and Architecture,Ann Bermingham,"Frederic Leighton is inextricably linked to the ""classical"" movement in late Victorian art. However, long before he was a classicist, Leighton's oeuvre was dominated by subjects from the late medieval/early Renaissance periods. The roots of Leighton's mature classicism are to be found in his so-called ""gothic"" works of this early period [c. 1846 (the date of his enrollment in the Stadelshes Kunstinstitut in Frankfurt, Germany) to 1864 (the date of his election as an Associate of the Royal Academy of Arts in London)], a period wherein he enjoyed a continued and direct exposure to the art of Italy, Germany, and France. A detailed accounting of Leighton's formative years and the profound effect exercised by his experience of the art of continental Europe is lacking. While art historians acknowledge that Leighton's work is much more complex than a simple reading might suggest, they invariably focus on his mature classicizing works. Leighton, however, viewed his works---be they from his ""gothic"" period or his ""classical"" period---as part of one continuum. Modern commentators routinely overlook this fact and divide his career into distinct periods. It is this compartmentalized view that this dissertation seeks to counter. Leighton's art is the product of a unique and highly selective process that would only have been conceivable in the context of his early cosmopolitan artistic experiences. An understanding of the circumstances that led to the formation of his early works elucidates the process whereby he developed a direct, transnational, and ultimately modern formulation of classicism centered on formal concerns. This dissertation examines Leighton's early career in the context of (1) his encounter with the art of the early Italian Renaissance and the art and artists of the German Nazarene movement; (2) the reception of his early works in Europe and America; (3) his encounter with French neoclassicism; and (4) its implications for his mature classicism.",Italy,12.56738,41.87194,12

East Asian Languages and Cultural Studies",East Asian Languages and Cultural Studies,Fabio Rambelli,"Empress Jingu (traditionally 169-269 CE) is a legendary figure, appearing in myths of the gods in the earliest chronicles of Japan, the Kojiki (712) and the Nihon shoki (720). According to these accounts, she was a shaman as well as empress and the vessel through which the gods made known their will to the emperor. At Emperor Chuai's death, she took up the divine mission bequeathed to her husband and organized an invasion of the Korean peninsula, calling on the gods whenever her goal was frustrated. She returned triumphant to Japan, bore a son, and ensured his succession to the throne through her own period of rulership. Though the paucity of historical evidence has led to various theories regarding the story's factual basis, its importance as a legend is evident from its appearance and reinvention through over a thousand years of Japanese history. This thesis charts what may perhaps be considered the first phase of that reinvention. In the later classical and medieval periods of Japan, Jingu's son, Emperor Ojin, was identified with Hachiman, a local god of increasingly central importance and an emblem of syncretic religious traditions within Japan. With the growing importance of Buddhism, both Hachiman and his mother were reimagined with Buddhists elements in their histories. Focusing on the Hachiman gudokun, a shrine-temple origins account written in the first decades of the fourteenth century, this thesis charts the developments of the Jingu narrative in various documents of the medieval period. Highlighting three key roles of Jingu's character--ruler, shaman, and Buddhist--I show how the Hachiman gudokun presented a version of Empress Jingu's story revitalized by contemporary developments in Buddhist and political thought, paving the way for the powerful martial image of Jingu that emerged during the Meiji Period.",Japan,138.252924,36.204824,20

East Asian Languages and Cultures",East Asian Languages and Cultures,Ann-Elise Lewallen,"This is a thesis clarifying the problems and events that occurred in the post-Fukushima era in the perspective of media treatments. The thesis will consist of three topics. The first topic is to explore whether mainstream media was able to provide timely and accurate information in dealing with the Fukushima disaster. The second topic concerns the information provided by mainstream media and the fear that important information was withheld and, for political reasons, triggered a wave of ""citizen journalism""(Slater2012), circulated primarily via social media. Social media experienced a trust crisis as mainstream suffered in post-Fukushima for a lack of source credibility. The third topic is to discuss the unique way in which young Japanese people interacted with social media during the aftermath of the Fukushima disaster. These interactions are reinforced rather than challenged the culturally-sanctioned behavior. Based on the analysis of the three parts above, this thesis will find that the distrust of the mainstream media enabled social media in Japan to develop rapidly after the Fukushima disaster, and that social media is believed to break the information monopolization of mainstream media successfully by providing multiple types of information. However, the source credibility of social media is limited. As a nascent phenomenon in Japan, citizen journalism might lead to misinformation and emotional effects among the public after disasters. Meanwhile, as young people are major users of social media in Japan, information circulated on social media will be more influential to young people than other groups. Social media affected the way Japanese youth dealt with interpersonal relationships and participated in social affairs in the aftermath of Fukushima disaster. Rather than question the credibility of information and express their opinions, young people tended to behave in unity with group members and friends to protect themselves from being criticized and isolated by others. In this sense, social media resulted in a loss of self-identity among Japanese youth. Social media may be seen as synchronizing minds rather than encouraging multiple opinions in Japan.",Japan,138.252924,36.204824,20

Education",Education,Jin Sook Lee,"Second language (L2) classrooms commonly consist of diverse learners with different L2 proficiency levels. This heterogeneity of levels has given L2 instructors pedagogical challenges in addressing their students' needs. One of the most promising practical approaches for alleviating this type of teachers' burden is to cultivate learner autonomy---the practice of taking control of one's learning (Benson, 2001)---through computer-assisted language learning materials, such as blogs. This study, conducted in a post-secondary intermediate Japanese L2 course, investigates the relationship(s) between L2 blogging, learner autonomy, and L2 proficiency levels. Drawing on the theoretical perspective that learner autonomy, which signifies self-management, is developed through using metacognitive strategies and metacognitive knowledge (Hauck, 2005), I explore how two more and two less proficient learners self-managed their L2 learning and use in the blogging process by employing metacognitive strategies and metacognitive knowledge. The qualitative analyses of data collected through think-aloud protocols, portfolios, post-interviews, and blog discourse observations demonstrate that L2 blogging supports the development of learner autonomy in a way that allows learners to individualize L2 learning. All of the learners set their personal learning goals to study specific types of content through blogging, focused their attention on the practice during the processes, and characterized their blog entries/comments as learning products. Simultaneously, however, L2 proficiency levels determined the subjects' individualized learning methods and the degree of their self-management of L2 use. The more proficient learners benefited more from interdependence for promoting learner autonomy (Little, 1994) in the blogosphere: they developed learner autonomy while experiencing authentic online social interaction with and relying on feedback from more capable language users. In contrast, the less proficient learners took less advantage of blog communication in individualizing their learning and had challenges in self-managing L2 use. These findings provide a broader theoretical basis for learner autonomy developed in learning processes with blogs in terms of individualized learning and teacher expectations. They also enhance teachers' understanding of how to incorporate blogs in L2 classrooms. It is critical that instructors consider the promotion of metacognitive knowledge and pedagogical interventions, especially for less proficient learners.",Japan,138.252924,36.204824,20

English",English,Shirley Geok-lin Lim,"This dissertation looks at theories of hope and utopia in the works of transnational and first-generation Chinese American authors from 1945-2010. By beginning after the Maoist Revolution and the Second Sino-Japanese War, this project follows the development of the transnational and first-generation new immigrant through the works of Lin Yutang, Li-Young Lee, Nieh Hualing, Ha Jin, and Wang Ping. In addressing these authors the dissertation considers how they have sought to leave behind the social and political conditions prevailing in China then, to journey across the Pacific and thence to imagine and author worlds different from their original sources. How do writers fictionalize migration and land-orientation to signal the emergence of a new hope, one less nation-based and instead invested in a global identity? These texts engage histories of Chinese Communism, American capitalism, and American democracy, and their re-imagined representations of these issues arguably have helped shape the new transnational immigrant sensibility in U.S. literary studies. The dissertation examines the resilience of hope as a re-generative affect in the social imaginary drawn in these texts when dreams of financial success, political freedom and upward social mobility fall short. As failure is dramatized and thematized, hope as a motivating idea becomes more and more situated in the immaterial world, and this alternative productively complicates the theories of utopia and hope that I review in this thesis. Studying immigrant attempts to achieve a utopia ""of one's own"" puts pressure on the US as a presumed utopian site and re-frames the conventional image of the country as a promised land. While the dissertation focuses on a select Chinese American canon as a signifier for a national shift in global identity, this focus, I argue, enables a larger investigation into and sustained discourse on the representations of hope in contemporary and ethnic U.S. writing.",Japan,138.252924,36.204824,20

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Chen Ji,"This dissertation focuses on the slip history of two well-observed devastating earthquakes: the 2008 Mw 7.9 Wenchuan, China event and the 2011 Mw 9.1 Tohoku-Oki, Japan event. We adopt a non-linear finite inversion code, developed by Ji et al. [2003], to image the kinematic rupture processes of those two earthquakes by jointly modeling seismic waveforms and geodetic measurements. Our results indicate that the Wenchuan earthquake simultaneously ruptured two sub-parallel faults with about 100 km on the low-angle Pengguan Fault and about 270 km on the high-angle Beichuan Fault. The rupture initiated at the intersection between those two faults and propagated only on the lower potion of the Pengguan Fault in the first 16 s. It then triggered the rupture on the Beichuan Fault about 40 km northeast of the hypocenter, where the Xiaoyudong Fault intersects those two faults on the surface. Although the Xiaoyudong Fault did not experience significant slip during the Wenchuan earthquake, it might act as a local tectonic boundary as inferred from the aftershocks and their focal mechanisms. For the Tohoku-Oki earthquake, our preferred model suggests that it has broken a big near-trench asperity with a peak slip up to 60 m. It re-ruptured the slip region of its March 9th M7 foreshock with a much larger slip, rise time, and slip velocity. One possible scenario model for this kind of foreshock-mainshock sequence is that the foreshock had only ruptured a relatively weaker patch inside a strongly coupled asperity, and the giant Tohoku-Oki event broke the strong asperity and released the deficit slip in the foreshock slip region. In addition to resolving the slip distributions for realistic earthquakes, we used the earthquake source inversion validation BlindTest 1 to investigate uncertainties associated with earthquake inversions based on strong motion data. Our results suggest that the fault slip and rise time distributions of the BlindTest 1 can be well constrained, but inversions using the variance reduction function of velocity waveforms as the objective function have low sensitivity to the total seismic moment and peak slip. Therefore, it is crucial for source studies to develop new inversion schemes that can properly honor the frequency and time dependent energy distribution of seismic radiation.",Japan,138.252924,36.204824,20

Global and International Studies",Global and International Studies,Jan Nederveen Pieterse,"In 2009 the governments of Brazil, Japan, and Mozambique agreed to launch a long-term agricultural development program along the Nacala Corridor in Northern Mozambique. The aim of the program known as ProSAVANA is to replicate the successes of the transformation which took place in the Cerrado region of Brazil beginning in the 1970s, helping that country to become a major global producer of several agricultural commodities. The governments in charge of the program have promised poverty alleviation and food security for Mozambican farmers through investment in agricultural research and extension services, increased land tenure security, improved irrigation, roads, and storage facilities, and greater access to modern inputs and markets through contract agriculture. However, since its early stages the program has faced intense opposition from small-scale farmers, peasant organizations, and national and international NGOs. There is great fear that the program will result in massive land expropriation benefiting corrupt politicians and foreign companies at the expense of the families farming in the region. These groups point to the massive concentration of land ownership and the environmental destruction that accompanied the transformation to large-scale mechanized agriculture in the Brazilian Cerrado. They also cite the large number of land conflicts in recent years between local small-scale farmers and foreign investors granted land concessions by the government. The large majority of Northern Mozambique's population practices rain-fed subsistence agriculture with little or no access to chemical fertilizers, pesticides, or improved seed varieties. More than 40 percent of farmers fail to produce enough crops to feed themselves for the entire year. Very few people in the region have land title and thus are in a precarious position. There is little doubt that increased investment in the region could contribute to higher crop yields and greater food production. However, it is also possible that more investment may also lead to an increase in the number of land conflicts and expropriation of peasant lands. In my thesis I will trace out the development of ProSAVANA and analyze some of the historical circumstances that may have contributed to the strong negative reaction against the program. I will review the Mozambican land tenure system and threats to the land tenure security of Mozambican peasants. I will look at the ways in which the opposition to ProSAVANA has led to changes in the rhetoric used in program documents, and possible changes to the priorities of the program itself. Finally, I will ask under what conditions the program may gain the acceptance of the peasant population and be considered a success.",Japan,138.252924,36.204824,20

History",History,Sabine Fruhstuck,"This project uses the optic of hermaphroditism to examine late nineteenth and early twentieth century investigations of sex in Japan. It explores the role that scientific thinking played in rooting identity in the body rather than within a web of social interactions and in setting female in opposition to male at a cellular level. This codification of maleness and femaleness as essential, inalterable, and filterable through a prism of science contributed to the fact of sex being brought increasingly within the totalizing domain of medicine. As the modern project to scientifically delineate the sexes ran into obstacles, it led to a fascination with those individuals whose sex could not be definitively classified. This dissertation seeks to illuminate this phenomenon by examining hermaphroditism and ambiguous sex at four sites. The first chapter explores broader theoretical issues by looking at the intersection of sex and nation-state through the prism of the conscription exam. The second chapter examines the creation of the disorder-concept of hermaphroditism (han'in'yo) within the Japanese medical establishment. Chapter three looks at attempts to delineate the sexes by examining the efforts of sexologist Sawada Junjiro to create a science of sexual difference.

History",History,Paul R. Spickard,"Advantage Through Crisis, is a comparative history of multiracial American-Japanese people who grew up in the U.S., Japan, and Okinawa during the post-World War II period through reversion in 1972. Immediately after the war, many children sired by members of the U.S. military were left behind in the care of their Japanese mothers and the Japanese government. Thousands of these multiracial Japanese-born Americans, neither received citizenship from the Japanese government nor were acknowledged by the U.S. government, and were legally stateless. Many were objects of intense discrimination and physical abuse because their visible American features made them politically marked bodies and a symbol of Japan's defeat. In short, they were Americans left overseas without U.S. governmental support, and often without the support of their biological parents. Many of these individuals lived in orphanages for mixed-race people until adopted by American, Japanese, or European families. At the same time they were left in the care of others, numerous American-Japanese grew up with their biological families in the U.S. and in Japan observing interracial marriages and their mixed families firsthand. Quite a few came to the U.S. on their own as teenagers and adults. I document the history of American-Japanese people through oral history, and construct my narrative by contextualizing their voices with archival research. This research is the first to look at life course histories of mixed-race American-Japanese, who are in their fifties and sixties, while examining their transnational experience. My approach of oral history in combination with archival research in English and in Japanese provides a complete historical framework of this population. My contribution to the scholarship connects the existing research on war brides, mixed-race families and Critical Mixed Race Studies and expands it to include the voices of multiracial people, including adoptees, from interracial unions. Upon interviewing multiracial people in the U.S. and Japan, I found that despite discrimination based on differences in race, often their multiracial consciousness served to provide them with options, not limitations.

History",History,Ralph Armbruster-Sandoval,"This study uncovers the roots of racism in the Southwest during the first half of the twentieth century and explores how racism affected people of color. It does so by examining connections between racism during the twentieth century and the historical and ideological legacy of Westward expansion. Frontier mores, such as violence, individualism, masculinity, and landownership, that justified Indian removal in the United States during the nineteenth century continued to inform racial prejudice in the Southwest well into the twentieth century. In the context of racial prejudice, this dissertation examines the experiences of people of color who lived, worked, and farmed in Imperial Valley, California. It delves into the complexities of race relations and racial prejudices within a multiplicity of racial groups in the Valley. In doing so, this study goes beyond the Black-white and Mexican-white binaries and investigates racism in the context of a pattern of ethnic and racial succession that included Yuma Indians, Japanese, Punjabis, Mexicans, Filipinos, and white Dust Bowl migrants. Within this multiethnic approach, it emphasizes the contributions of Yuma Indians during the beginnings of industrialized agriculture in the Valley and examines their experiences alongside those of Mexicans and whites. Moreover, this dissertation develops a new perspective on race relations by addressing the conflicts people of color experiences within their own ethnic and/or racial group, in particular, the turmoil that existed within the Japanese and Punjabi communities. They confronted racial prejudice in the larger white community while grappling with dysfunction within their respective racial and/or ethnic group. This study probes the strikes that swept the Valley during the Great Depression and asks how the values which emerged during the expansion of the West informed the violent practices and rhetoric large growers employed. Finally, this work addresses how frontierism promoted white supremacy during World War II as white citizens blamed interethnic violence, racial tensions, and poor moral values on the proximity of the U.S.-Mexico border. The border took on a deeply racialized meaning in the Valley as whites upheld the hierarchal and unequal power dynamic which harkened back to the arrival of the first colonists.",Japan,138.252924,36.204824,20

Linguistics",Linguistics,Patricia M. Clancy,"In the other two case studies, I examine the question: To what extent do the conversational grammars of non-native speakers exhibit the same relationships between grammatical form and discourse function as the conversational grammars of native speakers? In Chapter 4, I conduct a qualitative and quantitative analysis of Noun-Modifying Constructions (NMCs) and compare the usage of NMCs among native vs. non-native speakers, based on discourse factors, finding that the non-native speakers, especially those with more experience living in Japan, produced NMCs with frequencies and distributions similar to those of the native speakers. The first case study (Chapter 3) investigates the types of explicit and implicit interactional feedback (comprising negative as well as positive evidence) that native speakers provide in conversation with non-native speakers. I conduct a qualitative analysis of points in the conversation related to the non-native speaker's language ability, including instances of explicit metalinguistic discussion and of implicit feedback, such as recasts of non-native speaker utterances, and I suggest the ways in which these function as potential L2 learning mechanisms. Children acquire their L1 entirely through interactions with other speakers; in the same way, L2 learners benefit from participating in conversations with native speakers. I take a discourse-functional view of native speaker competence, assuming that positive evidence (language in use), comprising both frequency and contexts of usage, plays an important role in native speakers' mental representations and acquisition of grammar. If we assume that any comfortably proficient L2 speaker cannot have acquired that language ability solely from textbooks or classroom instruction, then the question arises: in what ways does conversation help language learners acquire a discourse-based grammar mirroring that of native speakers? I address this question across three case studies, using data from twelve conversations, each between one native speaker and one non-native speaker of Japanese. In Chapter 5, a quantitative analysis of subject argument realization, I use a mixed-effects model to show that both native and non-native speakers' patterns of subject realization are influenced by discourse-pragmatic factors such as givenness and contrast, and that the patterns observed among non-native speakers mirror those in native speakers' speech. I propose that non-native speakers can only demonstrate such similar sensitivities to discourse-pragmatic factors if exposed to native-speaker-like frequencies of use in conversation. The findings of this case study allow for a glimpse into the impact of positive evidence from natural input on L2 learners' acquisition of discourse-based grammar.",Japan,138.252924,36.204824,20

Linguistics",Linguistics,Matthew Gordon,"Patterns in orthographic representation of loanwords have often been used to infer information about phonological categories of the source and recipient languages. However perception studies have shown that loanword data can obscure patterns in perceptual mapping, e.g. Schmidt (1996). Korean exhibits a relatively unique phonemic contrast based on laryngeal activity, commonly referred to as tense /s*/ and lax /s/ or fortis and non-fortis /s/. This study investigates cross-lingustic perceptual mapping for Japanese single and geminate /s/ to the Korean lax /s/ and tense /s*/, and compares the results to predictions made by Japanese-to-Korean loanword research (Ito et al. (2006). A perception study was conducted using 32 bi-syllabic test tokens containing either Japanese single /s/ or geminate /ss/, and 32 bi-syllabic filler tokens, spoken in a carrier phrase by a 20-year-old native speaker of Tokyo Japanese. All tokens were presented twice in random order so that consistency of judgments could be analyzed. Twenty-two Korean native speakers participated in the experiment. Participants listened to stimuli over headphones and selected one of two orthographic representations for each stimuli, which for test stimuli differed only in whether they contained the character representing lax /s/ or tense /s*/. A linear mixed-effects model was used to evaluate thirteen acoustic and six phonological factors as predictors of response choice. The results contradicted some of the patterns observed by Ito et al. (2006), and in general found that Japanese phonological categories were less effective predictors than acoustic measurements. Additionally, many stimuli were found to have fairly high percentages of inconsistent responses. The results are taken to support a view that Korean native speaker mapping of Japanese fricatives is based on gradient perceptual similarity to native categories. An alternative description of the processes involved in cross-linguistic adaptation is proposed that references associative learning of acoustic correlates of speech perception and gradient activation of sound representations.",Japan,138.252924,36.204824,20

Music",Music,Lee Rothfarb,"Maurice Ravel is understood as a quintessential French composer. Yet, curiously, scholarship lacks consensus in defining his music and its relationship to that of his contemporaries. Contributing to the discrepancy are various writings that characterize Ravel's style as miniaturist, often described as both ""classical"" and reflective of his enthusiasm for East Asian art. Polymath musicologist Louis Laloy, a driving force in the French reception of l'Extreme-Orient, even described Ravel's music as japonisante and similar to Japanese landscapes. In defining the wider implications of these seemingly disparate reactions, the dissertation proposes that Ravel's musical textures exemplify French classicism's interaction with the late nineteenth-and early twentieth-century trend known as japonisme in vogue from around 1870 to 1935. Since the 1870s, japonisme has marked the reception and aesthetic impact of Japanese graphics on formal design in Paris throughout the arts and letters. In the absorption of style japonais, wood-block prints known as ukiyo-e became closely associated with miniaturism---the craft of expressing profundity or intensity of feeling within a limited space or time. Ravel is a viable and intriguing case study because his musical textures suggest a familiarity with ukiyo-e, particularly the prints and sketchbooks (Manga) of Katsushika Hokusai. As explained here, Ravel's deft evocations of classic and exotic intertwine japonisme and French classicism, an interaction not widely explored in musicology. The introduction defines Ravel's miniaturism as a response to japonisme's complex of style changes and proposes a sight-sound analytical methodology inspired by the study of ukiyo-e graphics. Chapter 1 investigates interactions between French classicism and japonisme and interprets Ravel's textural style as japonist-classicist. Chapter 2 explains Ravel's miniaturism through the lens of Hokusai's ukiyo-e. Chapter 3 applies the implications of the previous chapters to an analytical interpretation of the first movement of the duo Sonata for Violin and Cello, a chamber piece interpreted here as a japonist-classicist symphony. Chapter 4 concludes that approaching Ravel's music through japonisme demystifies the miniaturist label. Likewise it opens a fresh research space for studying the music of Ravel and his contemporaries in terms of East-West encounters and through the perspective of composer as craftsman.",Japan,138.252924,36.204824,20

Since the conventional three levels of analysis of International Relations cannot tell which specific outcome may be selected, a problem of multiple equilibria results. I contend that negotiators' bargaining strategies and tactics can solve a multiple equilibria problem as they help explain the specific details of outcomes. This research uses the recent agreement to multilateralize the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMIM), with particular emphasis on the issues of members' financial contributions and vote shares, to analyze negotiation processes. Due to data inaccessibility problems and financial constraints, I chose to focus on five of the most influential players in the CMIM negotiations---Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. It should be noted that China, though it was an important actor in the CMIM negotiations, is not included in my analysis due to a lack of direct access to Chinese sources. Extensive archival research and in-depth interviews were employed to collect data. Process tracing was a method of analysis. My investigation of the CMIM negotiations reveals that the member states employed several bargaining elements to alter final outcome. States with a lower discount rate (a lower sense of urgency) and a more attractive best alternative to no agreement (batna) were able to walk away with more favorable terms than those with a higher discount rate and less attractive batna. Also, possessing knowledge about other actors' preferences or about issues being discussed (expertise) enhanced states' relative bargaining leverage. Countries took advantage of being a co-chair of the negotiation to turn the agreement terms in their favor. In some circumstances, countries strategically linked issues under negotiation to reap concessions from the others. Additionally, forming a coalition or preventing a coalition of other states from forming sometimes helped states achieve their objectives.",Japan,138.252924,36.204824,20

Religious Studies",Religious Studies,Wade Clark Roof,"Social science research in religion seems to be losing sight of the middle ground where institutions and individuals interact and thus struggles to offer a constructive response to the dilemmas facing scholars of religion more generally. In response, this dissertation aims to bolster the efforts of those calling for an examination of the connections between lived religion and institutional fields. Viewing religion as a field or network visible through the interaction of individuals and institutions within it makes clear the object of social research and indicates a reflexive method for ethnographic research. Specifically, it is proposed that: (a) religion in general is a discursive field or network of communication and communicative action, definable only within its specific situation; (b) a ""religion"" in particular is a set of cohesive segmentary social networks characterized by discourse and communicative action in service of whatever is situationally defined as religious (most typically involving motivations and purposes commonly apprehended as related to the ultimate conditions of human existence); (c) lived religion, therefore, is empirically visible to the scholar solely through language and behavior by agents acting within those social networks; and (d) because of his or her active role in perceiving and interacting with and within the social networks that structure religious fields, the empirical scholar inherently and inevitably is a part of the field itself, which simply cannot exist without the relationship between the researcher and the object of study. These claims are illustrated with case studies using a variety of empirical methods; many underlying concerns remain the same regardless of how a particular situation is examined. Two cases (Japanese mizuko kuyo rituals and the True Love Waits chastity campaign) are based on analysis of primary and secondary sources, three others in ethnographic field research (Jews in postsocialist Slovakia, a ""Generation X"" church, and a Jewish seeker service), and one case (the Jewish emergent phenomenon) in a combination. The cases illustrate how to define and study religion empirically when it seems to be visible primarily in the interstitial middle ground where people articulate their sense of self and negotiate their relationships with one another.",Japan,138.252924,36.204824,20

Religious Studies",Religious Studies,Rudy Busto,"Theories of silence tend to depict silence as the opposite of sound, speech, or presence. In this limited depiction, it is the binary opposite indicating absence, and theorists have used this understanding of silence to illustrate musical rests, political oppression, and divine mystery. However, Japanese Americans employ silences in their arts in order to resist oppression and to pass on religious ideas and practices. Since Japanese Americans use multiple kinds of silence, this dissertation offers a theory of ""non-binary silence"" that explains how a single silence can accomplish multiple functions. The dissertation explores the multiple layers of silence in Japanese American history and in several Japanese American arts, including farming, gardening, hip hop, jazz, monuments, origami, rhetoric, sculpture, and comedy. This exploration reveals that Japanese Americans have maintained some persecuted and marginalized religious ideas and practices by transforming them into artistic silences. This process of gaimenteki, which means outward assimilation, is a tactic for spiritual survival that was developed to resist the oppression of Buddhism, Christianity, Shinto, and indigenous religions in Japan and in the United States. For example, during the World War II internment camps several Japanese American religions were categorized as dangerous, yet Japanese Americans communicated their religious ideas and practices through gardening and jazz music, which were considered innocuous and American. In such ways, Japanese Americans have responded to political and racist silencing with artistic silences that simultaneously preserve religion. This dissertation examines these religious silences through ethnographic and historical work. Case studies of Japanese American artists will be used to demonstrate how Japanese Americans have used religious silences to preserve ideas from Buddhism, Confucianism, and indigenous religions by transforming them to appear to match the racial, imperial, national, and colonial projects of Japan and the United States. The religious silences contain Japanese American conceptions of kami (Shinto deities), mediumship, Confucian attunement, the ethical treatment of life, an independent and interconnected self, sorrowful joy, and justice.",Japan,138.252924,36.204824,20

Sociology",Sociology,"G. Reginald Daniel, Denise A. Segura","Extensive theoretical and empirical research on the subject of racial/ethnic identity among multiracial (i.e. ""mixed race"") populations has yielded several models that either explain the development of racial/ethnic identity or present reference group typologies or patterns for multiracial people. Unfortunately, most models have been developed from small samples with particular blended combinations (e.g. Black/White, Japanese/White) and have not been tested on larger, more diverse samples. In other words, the efforts to develop mixed race identity models have not been matched with subsequent efforts to develop racial/ethnic identity scales. The creation and validation of a multiracial identity scale is an important contribution to critical mixed race studies to facilitate systematic findings on identity for multiracial individuals of various combinations. This dissertation will focus on the initial development of the Multiracial Reference Group Orientation Scale (MRGOS). The MRGOS was originally designed to measure four reference group orientations found in empirical research among multiracial populations: single RGO (orientation toward one parent ethnic group), multigroup RGO (orientation toward multiple parent ethnic groups), mixed race RGO (orientation toward other mixed race people as a group), and postracial RGO (nonidentification with parent ethnic groups and rejection of racial categorization). The MRGOS has been developed using an online survey targeting mixed race undergraduates at several four-year colleges and universities in California. Exploratory factor analysis and reliability analysis yielded a six-factor scale. Five of the factors conformed to the RGOs proposed in the model, including two postracial factors, though one non-RGO factor (Exploration) was also extracted from the original list of items. Adequate internal consistency was found for all of the RGO subscales except for the second postracial subscale. Partial support was found for the known groups validity of the mixed race, single, and one of the postracial subscales. Steps for the further development of the scale and the broader implications of the scale for research on race and ethnicity are discussed.",Japan,138.252924,36.204824,20

Theater Studies",Theater Studies,Christina McMahon,"Between 1997 and 2001, Shakespeare's Globe Theatre invited troupes from South Africa, Cuba, India, Brazil, and Japan to present translations of Shakespearean plays on its London stage. Known as the ""Globe to Globe"" series, this set of productions received ambivalent and sometimes condescending reviews from British critics who did not understand the translation languages or performance conventions. Taking these reviews to encapsulate the productions' reception, scholars have agreed that the series reinforced hegemonic hierarchies between spectators and performers. They argue that the displacement to London rendered the performances' original meanings unintelligible; further, that this dislocation stimulated national superiority in British spectators who measured the performances against their expectations of Shakespeare and their tourist-like desires to witness an exotic Other. However, this perspective obscures both the agency of the performers as participants in the encounter and the diversity of audience response, presenting a fatalistic view of touring performance. I argue that that in a performance across language and culture, failures in understanding do not indicate the failure of the event; rather, they can provoke spectators to suspend their preconceptions and negotiate new relationships. Reading professional reviews against the grain and placing them in conversation with video records and other documentation of the mass audiences' reactions, I suggest that the productions subverted the tourist gaze by resisting easy comprehension. As translation and 'foreign' performance conventions reshaped famous texts, the productions undermined audiences' expectations of both Shakespeare and the culture onstage. Confronted with the limits of their knowledge, spectators improvised new strategies of viewing, learning habits of listening and questioning that challenged cultural hierarchies. These events further undermined dominant power dynamics by attracting audiences from London's diasporic communities and privileging their knowledge and reactions over those of the normative British spectator. This trend intensified in 2012, when the Globe to Globe concept was revived as a massive festival for audiences containing many translation-language speakers. Through spectator surveys, I show that the 2012 performances contributed to a shift in the norms of mainstream London theatre, challenging the centrality of English as the standard for both Shakespearean performance and the source of audience privilege.",Japan,138.252924,36.204824,20

Education",Education,John Yun,"The purpose of this study is to explore the self-efficacy of Saudi businesswomen and advocates at the Saudi Arabian regional Chambers of Commerce and Industry and to contribute to our understanding of how Saudi Arabian women leaders develop over time. Through Bandura's self-efficacy framework (2005) and its effect on two key generational cohorts of women advocates, much can be learned about those women leaders advocating for the rights of Saudi businesswomen. My focus on self-efficacy of these two Generational Cohorts came from a pilot study (Alfrayan, 2013) on the self-efficacy component of leadership among Saudi businesswomen in three main regions in Saudi Arabia, Riyadh, Jeddah, and the Eastern province. The pilot study yielded evidence of the existence of two distinct Generational Cohorts among the Participants. The two Generational Cohorts are characterized by the event of the establishment of a women section that provided services to businesswomen. It is important to note that different geographic regions established women sections at their local chamber of commerce on different dates. Thus, the generations are not defined by time, but by context. Focus is given to how these leaders describe the development of their self-efficacy and what they chose to do with it. For the purpose of this study, the Generational Cohorts of the Participants were added as a dimension to understand how self-efficacy compares between generations. Using a Quantitative case study approach to closely studying six cases of two generational cohorts in three geographical locations was preformed. Applying Bandura's (1995) self-efficacy framework as the lens for examining the leadership development of businesswomen and professionals in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in two generations by researching the following questions were answered: What do Saudi Arabian businesswomen and advocates identify as the most important factors furthering and hindering the development of their self-efficacy to advocate for a larger role for women in business? and In what ways do these women leaders describe the two Generational Cohorts of women advocate's effects on one another?",Jeddah,39.2375507,21.2854067,1

There is a belief, backed by some research coming out of public mental health facilities in Jerusalem, that the religious community underutilizes traditional mental health resources (Rosen, Greenberg, Schmeidler & Shefler, 2008). The conclusion of the research proposes that the underutilization is likely due to stigma within the community. This study addresses the question: What is the process that Orthodox Jewish English-speaking immigrants in the Jerusalem community use to seek help in times of emotional stress? The study addresses both barriers and facilitators to resources for this community. A qualitative, constructivist grounded theory approach was used in the collection and analysis of 26 interviews. Standards of trustworthiness as outlined by Morrow (2005) were used to ensure the rigor of the study. The result is an attachment theory-informed, nine-stage cyclical model of help-seeking as well as in-depth descriptive information about individuals' unique and culturally specific experience of the nine stages. Factors such as individuals' help-seeking filters, structural barriers (mainly transportation and cost) as well as community emphasis on privacy and therapist value-match are some of the barriers identified by participants as important in their help-seeking processes; these findings indicate a more complex explanation and understanding of why this population may not use government-funded resources. These findings also have important implications for theory, research, practice and education.",Jerusalem,35.21371,31.768319,3

History",History,Elizabeth DePalma Digeser,"My research examines the evolving nature of Jerusalem and its holy places in Late Antiquity, through the lenses of memory, history, and religion. The city was transformed in the fourth century into the Christian ""Holy Land,"" and this dissertation examines how the imperially-driven change either adapted or overcame the city's previous associations with Judaism and paganism. I approached the topic as one of the creation of ""places of memory,"" following several sociological theorists of memory (e.g. M. Halbwachs, P. Nora). The chapters include analysis of early boundary-creation between Christians and Jews and the memorializing and identity-affirming aspects of the literary genre of ecclesiastical history, which grew up in parallel with the creation of the ""Holy Land."" The chief source for this section is Eusebius, who was both historian and witness to the process in the fourth century. I assess whether sacred space could be turned on its head---was Jerusalem a blessed city, or a cursed one? Pilgrim literature helps to inform this section on attraction, avoidance, and shifting blame. That leads to analysis of the fifth-century ecclesiastical historians (who saw themselves as Eusebius' heirs, but grew up in a totally different world) and transfers of holiness: relics, especially from Jerusalem, spreading throughout the world. Finally, running throughout the work is the thread of marginalization of Jews and Jewish places of memory in the increasingly Christianized cultic topography of Jerusalem. The final chapter takes us through the seventh-century Arab conquest of Jerusalem, and analyzes the new complexities and competition for sacred real estate amongst all three faiths that now held the city to be holy. Much like today, Late Antique Jerusalem was both blessed and cursed simultaneously, claimed by multiple parties but never shared.",Jerusalem,35.21371,31.768319,3

Religious Studies",Religious Studies,Catherine L. Albanese,"The built environment has been a focus of the study of sacred space for decades. This dissertation examines late twentieth-century evangelical religious practices to show the construction of mobile, geographical, and imagined sacred spaces. The study thus identifies ways that space and spatial logic have become integral to the development of contemporary religion. As the narrative recounts, by the late 1970s increasingly charismatic elements could be seen in mainstream evangelical mission strategies. Followers of two movements---Power Evangelism and Signs and Wonders---claimed they received spiritual gifts that were effective tools for church growth. A number, calling themselves spiritual warriors, began to emphasize their participation in a battle between God and Satan as a precondition for successful evangelism, and in this context mobile practices like prayerwalking became popular as spiritual warfare. In the global March For Jesus praise movement, warriors found that leaving the physical space of a church provided them better access to the sacred spaces most integral to their religious goals. Obstacles to evangelism were often interpreted as the product of territorial demons. This led not only to new practices of mapping that pinpointed the location of demonic strongholds, but also to new conceptions of the world. For spiritual warriors, cultural problems from the past, such as disputes with indigenous peoples, became the source of present-day social problems. Proponents said they were discerning spiritual landscapes hidden in time and space, and then they mapped the results on contemporary places. Finally, as the dissertation argues, the city has been a persistent backdrop for spiritual warfare. Evangelists saw danger and opportunity in the world's growing urbanism. They also focused on the Bible's many urban references. Cities were not only Babylons doomed to God's judgment. They were also Jerichos for God's army to conquer or Jerusalems waiting to be transformed by the coming Kingdom of God.",Jerusalem,35.21371,31.768319,3

Global and International Studies",Global and International Studies,Eve Darian-Smith,"This study is the result of two months of fieldwork conducted in the Maboneng Precinct; interviews were conducted with Propertuity staff, including Jonathan Liebmann (CEO of Propertuity Development), Alice Cabaret, the firm's urban strategist, as well as inner city residents, businesses, and South African nongovernmental organizations. This study ultimately aims to expose the under-discussed, central aspects of the neighborhood's design that act to reinforce class divisions and contribute to the displacement and marginalization of low-income residents throughout Johannesburg. The Maboneng Precinct, a regenerating neighborhood on the eastern side of the central business district (CBD), is rapidly transforming the inner city into a home for the city's elite and well-to-do youth. The Maboneng Precinct has successfully branded itself as an inclusive and integrated alternative to the exclusive northern suburbs, thereby allowing the neighborhood to successfully distance itself from accusations of gentrifying the inner city and displacing low-income residents. But despite a well-developed narrative of inclusivity, Maboneng is actively engaged in gentrifying urban space: the neighborhood functions as a fortified enclave within the inner city, where it caters exclusively to middle- and upper-income people seeking to ""take back the city"" from the urban poor. These actions erode the rights of ordinary individuals to inhabit, appropriate, and move within urban space. Dreams of a fully integrated and equitable South Africa have not been realized in the twenty years since the fall of apartheid. Inequality, spatial segregation, and economic and social exclusion within the country now highlight the limitations of the new democratic government and the incompleteness of South Africa's formal racial desegregation. These forces are articulated across Johannesburg's urban landscape, where: (1) wealth is concentrated in the northern suburbs, (2) peripheral townships continue to suffer from inadequate access to housing, service provision, and a lack of economic opportunity, and (3) inner city Johannesburg is dominated by the competing forces of urban degeneration and gentrification; interest in regenerating and reclaiming the inner city for wealthy suburbanites has grown in the last fifteen years, and now threatens to displace the inner city's low-income population.",Johannesburg,28.0473051,-26.2041028,1

Sociology",Sociology,Simonetta Falasca-Zamponi,"This dissertation analyzes the cultural meaning of the tree and the ways in which trees reflect and contribute to important discourses about nature and our relationship with the natural world. Although these discourses are often collectively identified as environmentalism, this all-encompassing term contains subtle but important differences that are occluded by the very language of environmentalism. The most important cultural ""location"" for this phenomenon is the tree, which is a metonym for nature. The tree, as representation, as idea, and as a physical organism, is deployed and understood in very different ways and for very different purposes. These differences are rendered invisible to many research methods because contemporary American culture treats trees with automatic hagiographic respect. Direct questioning, through survey research or traditional interviewing, will reveal only the superficial respect given to trees. More creative interview methods, along with a close reading of the way trees are treated in popular culture, reveal the divergent sensibilities that use arboreal language as a way to understand and give meaning to the relationship between humans and the physical world. Interviews were conducted in public urban and forested areas in California, Kansas, and New York and complemented by hermeneutic analysis of tree imagery in Christmas decorations, advertising, and landscape. Each interview revolved around the infamous 'If you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be?' question made popular by Barbara Walters. The methods, interviews and analysis employed reveal just how many faux-environmentalist sensibilities rely on the idea, image, and planting of trees. When the tree is worshiped, uncritically, as a balm for all the ills of the modern world, it denies ecological thinking. The romanticization of the tree is dangerous because it usurps trees from the plant kingdom and uses them to redecorate and remodel urban environments.

Sociology",Sociology,Simonetta Falasca-Zamponi,"This dissertation analyzes the cultural meaning of the tree and the ways in which trees reflect and contribute to important discourses about nature and our relationship with the natural world. Although these discourses are often collectively identified as environmentalism, this all-encompassing term contains subtle but important differences that are occluded by the very language of environmentalism. The most important cultural ""location"" for this phenomenon is the tree, which is a metonym for nature. The tree, as representation, as idea, and as a physical organism, is deployed and understood in very different ways and for very different purposes. These differences are rendered invisible to many research methods because contemporary American culture treats trees with automatic hagiographic respect. Direct questioning, through survey research or traditional interviewing, will reveal only the superficial respect given to trees. More creative interview methods, along with a close reading of the way trees are treated in popular culture, reveal the divergent sensibilities that use arboreal language as a way to understand and give meaning to the relationship between humans and the physical world. Interviews were conducted in public urban and forested areas in California, Kansas, and New York and complemented by hermeneutic analysis of tree imagery in Christmas decorations, advertising, and landscape. Each interview revolved around the infamous 'If you were a tree, what kind of tree would you be?' question made popular by Barbara Walters. The methods, interviews and analysis employed reveal just how many faux-environmentalist sensibilities rely on the idea, image, and planting of trees. When the tree is worshiped, uncritically, as a balm for all the ills of the modern world, it denies ecological thinking. The romanticization of the tree is dangerous because it usurps trees from the plant kingdom and uses them to redecorate and remodel urban environments. Trees are a counter-narrative to modernity, but a failed counter-narrative, an evil detournement. Within these discourses, however, is another sensibility, suggesting ways that even a tree-based rhetoric can shift into a more holistic ecological approach that can eliminate the delineation of nature, as non-man, into a vision of an ecology that permeates the urban and rural Earth.",Kansas,-98.4842465,39.011902,4

Physics",Physics,Benjamin Monreal,"The presence of non-zero neutrino mass is one of the most important discoveries of physics beyond the standard model. Experiments in neutrino oscillation have established the mass splittings and mixing parameters of the (as of now) three known mass states, but the absolute scale of neutrino masses remains a mystery. In addition, evidence has mounted suggesting that the current picture of the three neutrino species may not be complete. The KATRIN (Karlsruhe Tritium Neutrino) experiment aims to measure the neutrino mass to 0.2 eV, representing an order of magnitude improvement in any direct measurement of the absolute scale. KATRIN will accomplish this task by measuring the endpoint spectrum of beta decay electrons from molecular tritium. The high precision beta spectroscopy will be performed via magnetic collimation electrostatic (MAC-E) filter spectroscopy. This measurement technique presents several sources of systematic error. In particular, it is of utmost importance that the activity and column density is of tritium is known to high precision. The presence of backscattered electrons also have the potential to alter the shape of the tritium endpoint. This document contains discussion of these systematic uncertainties, along with the design and construction of calibration systems that aim to reduce those systematics. The question of electron backscattering, and how it applies to the KATRIN measurement has also been explored experimentally for the first time. A measurement has been performed using a scanning electron microscope and custom-designed electrostatic spectrometer to measure the energy spectrum of backscattered electrons close to the tritium endpoint energy. An analysis has also been performed to explore the possible systematics originating from backscattered electrons on a possible keV-scale sterile neutrino search. The electron backscattering experiment has measured Auger electrons from gold in the energy range 6-11 keV produced at a rate of 10-4 Auger electrons per incident electron. An investigation of proposed keV sterile neutrino search analysis methods show that this rate of Auger electron production is problematic, and work needs to be done to reduce this source of background if a keV-scale sterile neutrino search is to be successful.",Karlsruhe,8.4037,49.0069,1

Geography",Geography,Bodo Bookhagen,"High Mountain Asia (HMA) has been strongly impacted by climate change, and will continue to be impacted by diverse climate stressors in the coming years. A combination of changing weather patterns and retreating glaciers has begun to impact water resources in the region; the rate, extent, and mechanisms behind these changes are poorly quantified due to a lack of data and process understanding. As rivers sourced in HMA feed more than a billion people in the region, increased understanding of climate impacts on regional hydrology is essential for effective water management. Glaciers play a diverse role in hydrology throughout the range, with some catchments having little to no reliance on glacial meltwater, and some catchments receiving almost all of their water from glaciers. This study aims to decipher the impact of climate change on glaciers in the Tien Shan mountain range, a large and understudied region that extends roughly 2,800 km northeast from the Pamir Knot in Tajikistan through China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Mongolia towards the Altai Mountains. As glacial area extents do not present a complete picture of the impacts of climate change on glaciers, the author undertook a pilot study to examine the mass balances of glaciers throughout the range. Mass balance estimates are a proxy for changes in water equivalent stored in a glacier, and are thus essential measurements for understanding the hydrology of the range. The author presents preliminary evidence that high elevation areas in the Tien Shan are thickening, even in the context of retreating glacial tongues. This implies an overall gain of ice mass in the region, despite generally retreating glaciers. This trend was linked to recent increases in precipitation in the range, as well as increases in air temperature. There is not yet enough data to unravel changes in glacier mass balance across the range, although the author predicts that the recently coined 'Karakoram Anomaly' may in fact need to be renamed to include both the Pamir and the western Tien Shan. After validating the algorithm against multiple manually digitized control datasets, the author applied it to a study area encompassing six Landsat scene footprints along the strike of the Tien Shan Orogen. A statistically significant, though minor, gradient in glacier retreat was found, where those glaciers in the west of the range have retreated less than those glaciers in the east. This gradient is explained by differences in regional climate, where large winter storms tend to arrive from the west and break apart and weaken before moving towards the eastern edge of the range. This is substantiated by differences in mean annual precipitation, as derived from Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) 3B43 V7 data, as well as differences in atmospheric lapse rates, where the western region of the range remains cold year-round and the more eastern edges have larger annual temperature fluctuations, as well as a lower overall lapse rate, which implies higher temperatures at higher elevations. Previous studies in the region lack the data to decipher gradients in glacial retreat across the range. To address this data deficit, the author designed and implemented a glacial mapping algorithm which delineates both clean glacial ice---methods which are well documented---and glacial debris tongues, which often require extensive manual digitization. This research is the most significant part of the thesis, and improves upon methods developed to automatically delineate glacial areas using spectral, topographic, velocity, and spatial relationships. The author found that the algorithm misclassifies between 2 and 10% of glacial areas, compared to a ~700 glacier control dataset. These results show significant improvement over previously used methods, as well as large-scale glacier databases such as the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI) which are commonly used in mountain-belt scale studies of glaciers.",Kazakhstan,66.923684,48.019573,1

Education - Gevirtz Graduate School",Education - Gevirtz Graduate School,Danielle B. Harlow,"This study examines the role of place-based science education in fostering student-driven health interventions. While literature shows the need to connect science with students' place and community, there is limited understanding of strategies for doing so. Making such connections is important for underrepresented students who tend to perceive learning science in school as disconnected to their experiences out of school (Aikenhead, Calabrese-Barton, & Chinn, 2006). To better understand how students can learn to connect place and community with science and engineering practices in a village in Kenya, I worked with community leaders, teachers, and students to develop and study an education program (a school-based health club) with the goal of improving knowledge of health and sanitation in a Kenyan village. While students selected the health topics and problems they hoped to address through participating in the club, the topics were taught with a focus on providing opportunities for students to learn the practices of science and health applications of these practices. Students learned chemistry, physics, environmental science, and engineering to help them address the health problems they had identified in their community. Surveys, student artifacts, ethnographic field notes, and interview data from six months of field research were used to examine the following questions: (1) In what ways were learning opportunities planned for using science and engineering practices to improve community health? (2) In what ways did students apply science and engineering practices and knowledge learned from the health club in their school, homes, and community? and (3) What factors seemed to influence whether students applied or intended to apply what they learned in the health club? Drawing on place-based science education theory and community-engagement models of health, process and structural coding (Saldana, 2013) were used to determine patterns in students' applications of their learning. Students applied learning across health topics they identified as interesting and relevant to their community: hand-washing, disease-prevention, first aid, balanced diet, and water. Students' application of their learning was influenced by internal, external, and relational factors with the community, science education factors, and cultural factors. Some factors, which may have been barriers for students to apply their learning, were turned into supports via bridging strategies used by the students and teacher. Bridging strategies allowed students to connect between their place and science in meaningful ways in the classroom. These strategies were critical in bringing students' place into the classroom and enabling students to apply their learning toward place. The model resulting from the identified factors informed existing models for sociocultural considerations in community-based health interventions. The community-engagement applied practices of science (CAPS) model serves to conceptualize findings in this study and informs an integrated method for using community-engagement education as a stimuli for students to become cultural brokers and improve community health. In addition to focusing on teaching practices of science and encouraging students to apply their learning, this research suggests that bridging strategies can be used to connect science with a students' place in meaningful ways that serve both students and their local communities.",Kenya,37.906193,-0.023559,7

Geography",Geography,"Stuart Sweeney, Douglas Steigerwald","This dissertation consists of three separate papers. In the first paper I ask how the influence of global and local forces on Mexican maize prices changed during a period when markets became more open to inter and intra-national trade. I find that the influence of global forces do vary over the study period, and counter to expectation, are highest at the beginning and middle of the period rather than the end. In contrast, the influence of local forces follows expectation and decreases over time. However the effect sizes diminish in a model that accounts for unobserved state-year variation, which could include policy interventions designed specifically to cushion against local influences. Overall, the results suggest that opening agricultural markets can result in regionally distinct outcomes and that government price supports have a stronger impact on the influence of local forces than they do on global forces. In the second paper I evaluate characteristic based clustering (CBC) as a tool to both facilitate forecasts of cross-market grain price data and conduct exploratory analysis of price behavior dissimilarities across multiple markets. Characteristic based clustering refers to the practice of identifying similarities in multiple time series where the distances among the time series are a function of the structural characteristics in the data. I conduct a simulation experiment to determine if the characteristic clustering approach can be used to improve the accuracy or computational efficiency of grain price forecasts. I find that forecasts from characteristic based clusters of time series are sometimes as accurate as forecasts from individual time series and can be completed in 60-80% of the computational time. In the second half of the paper I use characteristic based clustering to explore the similarity of price behavior among Kenyan maize markets. I find that price behavior in remote markets has become increasingly dissimilar from markets in other Kenyan cities, and that these dissimilarities cannot be explained solely by geographic distance. The final paper focuses on the appropriate method of inference when modeling balanced spatial panel data with unobserved time varying spatial correlation. I use simulation experiments to compare the performance of estimation techniques that use prespecified spatial weights matrices and those that do not. The results suggest that the pattern of time varying correlation does have some impact on the choice of method, but not as much as the spatial weights misspecification literature would suggest. I also find that choosing the appropriate inferential method is less of a concern if the data generating process follows a hub and spoke correlation structure. Finally, I confirm earlier results that the cluster robust modifications proposed by Bester, Conley, and Hansen (2011) perform well as long as group sizes are chosen appropriately.",Kenya,37.906193,-0.023559,7

Geography",Geography,Oliver Chadwick,"HIV/AIDS can present a significant economic, medical, and psychological shock to households in sub-Saharan Africa, and can considerably alter household livelihood behavior. While there is speculation that household impoverishment related to HIV-affliction and the onset of AIDS can drive households into greater dependence on their local, natural environment for food, medicine, fuel, construction materials, and other products, evidence is limited. This study queried the 2008-2009 Kenyan Demographic Health Survey Database for associations at the national level between household HIV-affliction and three natural resource use variables: primary household fuel type, drinking water source, and presence in the household of an adult self-reporting as a subsistence fisheries or agricultural worker. Manual, step-wise binomial and multinomial logistic regression models (N=4000+ households) were constructed to examine these associations while controlling for geographic and socio-demographic factors. Model results demonstrated that HIV-afflicted households were 40-70% less likely than un-afflicted households to use natural fuels compared to processed fuels, and 30% less likely (weighted model, only) to rely on surface water sources compared to purchased or engineered water sources. No difference was detected between HIV-afflicted versus un-afflicted households regarding presence of an adult engaged in subsistence fishery or agricultural work. While a cross-sectional analysis limits discussion of causality, possible explanations include household adaptation to labor loss and/or increased exposure to HIV infection of communities with access to infrastructure. The results of this study caution against case study bias in the existing HIV-environment literature, and highlight the need for randomized, longitudinal studies on this topic.",Kenya,37.906193,-0.023559,7

Geography",Geography,Michael F. Goodchild,"How might risk perception and risk factors influence the spread of disease? To answer this question, we must first understand how risk perception influences risk-taking behaviors that result in an increased susceptibility to infection. Risk factors classified as behavioral and medical also contribute to susceptibility. This research explores the dynamics of tuberculosis disease spread in West Kenya. Behaviors associated with tuberculosis are complex and driven by a number of factors as evidenced by the current body of knowledge. A literature review on the role of tuberculosis perception, with an emphasis on perceived causes and modes of transmission, highlights this fact. To encapsulate decisions, this research explores one behavioral consequence of risk perception: avoidance. The act of accepting risk based on some utility to interact with a known infected individual can, in some cases, be identified as risk attenuation. In other cases, an individual may have little control over whom they interact with and when. To explore how these dynamics may influence the spread of tuberculosis; an agent-based model was employed. West Kenya was chosen to test the model due to its increasing rates of newly diagnosed tuberculosis cases and the identification of several multidrug-resistant cases. HIV and tuberculosis co-infections are also of particular concern for health officials in Kenya and many other parts of the world. Avoidance as a way to reduce contact with infectious individuals did not show a favorable result in the simulated population, and additional experiments to explore the potential consequences of an increased stigmatization of the disease brought about by widespread avoidance further produced unfavorable results. Due to crowding, avoidance did little to reduce initial infections, yet a scaling effect was identified as a limitation. More favorable results were found when other risk factors associated with tuberculosis were reduced, effectively simulating a more resilient population able to fight off initial infection and transition to the infectious active stage of the disease. Finally, an exploration of better treatment compliance and the outcomes for a shorter treatment option showed the greatest impact on the simulated population. While education campaigns may be necessary to increase the overall understanding of tuberculosis within the population, efforts to strengthen the population against initial infection and furthering the development of shorter treatment options that improve treatment compliance will have the greatest positive impact on the population.",Kenya,37.906193,-0.023559,7

Khoury,"This work re-considers current descriptions of pre-colonial Swahili stone architecture by applying formal analysis to structures from the 'golden age' of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries and the Swahili heartland regions of mainland Tanzania and Kenya. The results of this analysis are compared to mainstream descriptions of Swahili architecture. They are then used to make comparisons between the remains of pre-colonial Swahili stone structures and those in built environments that are popularly identified as essentially 'Islamic.' This project seeks to generate an updated description of early Swahili architecture while providing a useful case study of Islamic architecture at the margins of the field. The data for this work was attained through a combination of archival and onsite research. The latter was carried out through visits to Kenya and Tanzania over the course of two summers, 2006 and 2009. The analysis is separated into sections focusing on religious, domestic and public spaces that were chosen from a cross section of stone town sites. The findings support that pre-colonial Swahili spaces were designed by and for the local Swahili community. The analysis of religious structures suggests that nine-bay mosques may have had a commemorative function. For larger mosques it is proposed that longitudinal orientation and the visual obstruction of the mihrab by central pillars are deliberate (rather than accidental) features that were intended to emphasize the direction of prayer. The analysis of housing reveals that pre-colonial Swahili stone houses exhibit only minimal degrees of visual restriction: the stringently gendered, intimacy gradient that is thought to circumscribe both social and physical Swahili space was a relatively late development that can be linked to the period of Omani colonization in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The late colonial period also marks the earliest evidence of a formal relationship between Swahili stone houses and coastal South Arabian houses. The analysis of public space suggests that pre-sixteenth century parallels between Mijikenda and Swahili urban form are tenuous at best. When these parallels exist they can be ascribed to a shared cultural climate without the necessity of identifying direct links between one or another local groups.",Kenya,37.906193,-0.023559,7

Linguistics",Linguistics,Carol Genetti,"This thesis aims to advance the idea that prosody is fundamentally about creating cohesion, that is, signaling the ""relations of meaning that exist within the text"" (Halliday & Hasan 1976:4). Building on research on the cohesive function of prosody by Wichmann (2000) and Wennerstrom (2001), I show how each of the features generally referred to as prosodic are used by speakers to lend cohesion to their discourse by signaling the transitions from one unit of discourse to the next, the relations that hold between those units, and their relative prominence. To accomplish this, I look at six prosodic cues in Ekegusii, a Great Lakes Bantu language of southwestern Kenya with lexical and grammatical tone (Cammenga 2002; Nash 2011). Those cues are pause, vowel elision, prosodic accent, pitch reset, isotony (intonational parallelism), and intonational contour. For each feature, I exemplify the ways in which it demarcates conceptually cohesive units of discourse, and/or signals the relations between one unit of speech and another. I show that when these prosodic cues appear, they create cohesive ties between one segment of discourse and another by signaling where one discourse topic ends and another begins, and indicating how -- and how closely -- the new discourse topic relates to the old (Couper-Kuhlen 2004; Swerts & Geluykens 1994). Together with morphosyntactic devices for cohesion, such as anaphoric pronouns and reference, the cohesive ties created by prosody are what give coherence to the text, thus distinguishing it from a random assortment of unrelated utterances (Halliday & Hasan 1976). I conclude by discussing how an understanding of prosody as a means for signaling discourse cohesion complements more interactional approaches to prosody (Barth-Weingarten 2013; Barth-Weingarten & Reber 2010; Couper-Kuhlen & Ford 2004), and provides a language-independent means of examining prosody crosslinguistically, thus laying a foundation for future typological studies.",Kenya,37.906193,-0.023559,7

Since World War II through the rise of the modern political right, Mexican immigrants and their descendants shaped rural and urban civil rights reform in California's interior. This dissertation draws upon several archival repositories related to labor and civil rights history in California's Central Valley, including the collected papers of the United Farm Workers (UFW), the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF), the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Region I, West Coast Branch (NAACP-WC), the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), as well as previously unexamined personal paper collections of Bakersfield civil rights leaders and politicians. Referred to pejoratively as ""Mississippi West"", given the county's vibrant history of civil rights activism and antistatist opposition toward civil rights, Kern County is ground-zero for a massive demographic transformation from a white to Hispanic majority; a trend other U.S. regions will experience in the coming decades. The history of race relations, civil rights, and politics in the region sheds light on the importance of a burgeoning Latino population, as well as marks a bellwether for future U.S. social and political trends in California and beyond.",Kern County,-118.8596804,35.4937274,1

Education",Education,"Hsiu-Zu Ho, Cynthia Hudley","Chapter 4 reports the results of the study. T-tests were used to verify whether ethnic socialization messages were experienced within the surveyed members of the population and the study confirms that Korean American adolescents and young adults experienced having ethnic socialization conversations with parents and with friends. Multivariate regressions were conducted to examine the influences of the two sources of ethnic socialization on ethnic identity separately. The global construct of parent ethnic socialization significantly predicted exploration and resolution and the global construct of friend ethnic socialization significantly predicted exploration. Finally structural equation modeling was used to model each of the three subcomponents of ethnic socialization from each source and the three dimensions of ethnic identity simultaneously. Only parent promotion of mistrust significantly predicted exploration; whereas all three friend ethnic socialization components predicted all three aspects of ethnic identity. To contribute to the growing research on ethnic identity development, this dissertation examined the influences of parent and peer ethnic socialization on Korean American ethnic identity. Ethnic identity was defined using three dimensions: exploration, resolution, and affect. Exploration refers to the extent to which one has explored one's ethnic heritage. Resolution refers to a feeling of reaching a comfortable ethnic identity after exploration. Affect refers to the feelings one has towards one's ethnic identity. Ethnic socialization was defined as having three subcomponents: cultural socialization, preparation for bias, and promotion of mistrust. Cultural socialization refers to conversations regarding one's history, culture, food, and other ethnic background knowledge. Preparation for bias refers to conversations regarding the bias that one may experience in greater society. Promotion of mistrust refers to conversations suggesting the individual keep distance from those of other ethnic and racial backgrounds. Ethnic identity has been identified as being significantly related to both academic achievement and psychological well-being. Thus, the healthy and secure achievement of ethnic identity is an important developmental task. Chapter 3 introduces the participants of the study and the methodologies used to answer the research question. Three-hundred and twenty-two Korean American adolescents and young adults were surveyed using an instrument made up several modified survey measures. The Ethnic Identity Scale (Umana-Taylor, Yazedjian, & Bamaca-Gomez, 2004) was modified and shortened. Questions previously asked to parents about their racial socialization practices (Hughes & Chen, 1997; Hughes & Johnson, 2001) were modified to fit the study's design of surveying adolescent and young adults about their perceived experiences having conversations with their parents and their friends. A pilot study was conducted preliminarily in order to test the validity of the survey instrument's use on this population and the results of the pilot study are included in this chapter. Further discussions regarding the findings, limitations and suggestions for further research are included in chapter 5. Ethnic identity and ethnic socialization were examined in a relatively understudied subpopulation of interest, Korean Americans. The Korean American community is typically viewed as being successful, based on the high proportions of those who hold postsecondary degrees and a median income that is higher than general median income for the United States (U.S. Census, 2011). However, adolescents in the community also experience mental and physical health challenges. The literature review in this dissertation discusses the role of ethnic identity in adolescent development, parent ethnic socialization, and the role of friends during adolescence. The literature suggests that friend ethnic socialization may be an important variable that has not been fully explored in research on ethnic identity development. The review concludes with the research questions examined in this dissertation.",Korea,127.9784585,37.6639976,2

Linguistics",Linguistics,Matthew Gordon,"Patterns in orthographic representation of loanwords have often been used to infer information about phonological categories of the source and recipient languages. However perception studies have shown that loanword data can obscure patterns in perceptual mapping, e.g. Schmidt (1996). Korean exhibits a relatively unique phonemic contrast based on laryngeal activity, commonly referred to as tense /s*/ and lax /s/ or fortis and non-fortis /s/. This study investigates cross-lingustic perceptual mapping for Japanese single and geminate /s/ to the Korean lax /s/ and tense /s*/, and compares the results to predictions made by Japanese-to-Korean loanword research (Ito et al. (2006). A perception study was conducted using 32 bi-syllabic test tokens containing either Japanese single /s/ or geminate /ss/, and 32 bi-syllabic filler tokens, spoken in a carrier phrase by a 20-year-old native speaker of Tokyo Japanese. All tokens were presented twice in random order so that consistency of judgments could be analyzed. Twenty-two Korean native speakers participated in the experiment. Participants listened to stimuli over headphones and selected one of two orthographic representations for each stimuli, which for test stimuli differed only in whether they contained the character representing lax /s/ or tense /s*/. A linear mixed-effects model was used to evaluate thirteen acoustic and six phonological factors as predictors of response choice. The results contradicted some of the patterns observed by Ito et al. (2006), and in general found that Japanese phonological categories were less effective predictors than acoustic measurements. Additionally, many stimuli were found to have fairly high percentages of inconsistent responses. The results are taken to support a view that Korean native speaker mapping of Japanese fricatives is based on gradient perceptual similarity to native categories. An alternative description of the processes involved in cross-linguistic adaptation is proposed that references associative learning of acoustic correlates of speech perception and gradient activation of sound representations.",Korea,127.9784585,37.6639976,2

Geography",Geography,Bodo Bookhagen,"High Mountain Asia (HMA) has been strongly impacted by climate change, and will continue to be impacted by diverse climate stressors in the coming years. A combination of changing weather patterns and retreating glaciers has begun to impact water resources in the region; the rate, extent, and mechanisms behind these changes are poorly quantified due to a lack of data and process understanding. As rivers sourced in HMA feed more than a billion people in the region, increased understanding of climate impacts on regional hydrology is essential for effective water management. Glaciers play a diverse role in hydrology throughout the range, with some catchments having little to no reliance on glacial meltwater, and some catchments receiving almost all of their water from glaciers. This study aims to decipher the impact of climate change on glaciers in the Tien Shan mountain range, a large and understudied region that extends roughly 2,800 km northeast from the Pamir Knot in Tajikistan through China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Mongolia towards the Altai Mountains. As glacial area extents do not present a complete picture of the impacts of climate change on glaciers, the author undertook a pilot study to examine the mass balances of glaciers throughout the range. Mass balance estimates are a proxy for changes in water equivalent stored in a glacier, and are thus essential measurements for understanding the hydrology of the range. The author presents preliminary evidence that high elevation areas in the Tien Shan are thickening, even in the context of retreating glacial tongues. This implies an overall gain of ice mass in the region, despite generally retreating glaciers. This trend was linked to recent increases in precipitation in the range, as well as increases in air temperature. There is not yet enough data to unravel changes in glacier mass balance across the range, although the author predicts that the recently coined 'Karakoram Anomaly' may in fact need to be renamed to include both the Pamir and the western Tien Shan. After validating the algorithm against multiple manually digitized control datasets, the author applied it to a study area encompassing six Landsat scene footprints along the strike of the Tien Shan Orogen. A statistically significant, though minor, gradient in glacier retreat was found, where those glaciers in the west of the range have retreated less than those glaciers in the east. This gradient is explained by differences in regional climate, where large winter storms tend to arrive from the west and break apart and weaken before moving towards the eastern edge of the range. This is substantiated by differences in mean annual precipitation, as derived from Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) 3B43 V7 data, as well as differences in atmospheric lapse rates, where the western region of the range remains cold year-round and the more eastern edges have larger annual temperature fluctuations, as well as a lower overall lapse rate, which implies higher temperatures at higher elevations. Previous studies in the region lack the data to decipher gradients in glacial retreat across the range. To address this data deficit, the author designed and implemented a glacial mapping algorithm which delineates both clean glacial ice---methods which are well documented---and glacial debris tongues, which often require extensive manual digitization. This research is the most significant part of the thesis, and improves upon methods developed to automatically delineate glacial areas using spectral, topographic, velocity, and spatial relationships. The author found that the algorithm misclassifies between 2 and 10% of glacial areas, compared to a ~700 glacier control dataset. These results show significant improvement over previously used methods, as well as large-scale glacier databases such as the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI) which are commonly used in mountain-belt scale studies of glaciers.",Kyrgyzstan,74.766098,41.20438,1

This study explores patterns of segregation in Las Vegas and considers the communities and architecture, including clubs, schools and churches, as well as the material culture, such as signage, posters and promotional materials, that expand our understanding of segregated living in the desert city. Intermingled histories of image and building reflect the intersections of both the social and built landscape; therefore, my analysis moves between three scales and modes of evidence---the visual and oral, architectural, and the larger scale of the city. Patterns of discrimination and separation began in the city's earliest days and remnants of these divisions continue to resonate in Las Vegas. Thus, while the period of de facto segregation is the core of this work, chapters are structured chronologically to follow patterns in Las Vegas' racial landscape from the incorporation of the city as a railroad settlement to 1970. These include discussions of Depression-era growth supported by federal investment in the region, the resultant division of labor and community simultaneous with the growth of tourism, creation of the segregated Westside and its clubs and casinos, the opening of the integrated Moulin Rouge, the rise of political resistance in the face of racism, and the results of interstate construction and school district desegregation between 1965 and 1971. This study takes into account Las Vegas' rich material culture and spatial problematic in order to understand the interrelationship of violence, class, racism, and architectural practice that has produced the city's urban and cultural topography and traces the ways in which architecture and urban spaces were implicated in the struggle to locate opportunities for resistance in the face of rapid urban growth and discrimination.",Las Vegas,-115.1398296,36.1699412,1

Psychological and Brain Sciences",Psychological and Brain Sciences,David Sherman,"Affirmations have been shown to have diverse and enduring effects. One mechanism that has recently been proposed to account for affirmation's long-term and disparate effects is affirmation's ability to shape individuals' narratives in response to threatening contexts. Across four studies, this dissertation seeks to probe deeper into understanding affirmation's effects and the role that changes in individuals' narratives play in leading to affirmation's outcomes. In Study 1, I investigate whether affirmations can reduce emotional reactivity in response to negative emotional events by changing the narratives that individuals tell themselves regarding their experience. In Study 2, I investigate whether individuals have a dispositional tendency to self-affirm in the face of life's everyday stressors and whether this tendency to self-affirm works via processes similar to those found in experimentally induced affirmations to produce similar positive outcomes. Further, Study 2 looks at how this tendency to self-affirm might change individuals' narratives regarding a uniquely stressful circumstance, the uncertainty of a military coup and ongoing political instability. In Study 3, I look at how experimentally induced affirmations change the stories individuals tell themselves about their experience of threat over time and in the context of chronic and existential threat---breast cancer diagnosis and treatment. Finally, in Study 4, I look at how an affirmation intervention might be combined with a novel narrative based stigma reduction technique to reduce HIV related stigma in the context of communities with high HIV rates and high HIV stigma in rural Lesotho, Africa.",Lesotho,28.233608,-29.609988,1

I challenge the dominant narrative that the international community has failed to intervene in Syria, by pointing to the manifold government-funded arms transfers to opposition groups beginning in 2012. I find that there are two significant networks of arms trafficking: one through Jordan with Saudi Arabian and American support; the other through Turkey with Qatari support. These patterns and rivalries between donor countries have contributed to three processes within the transformation from revolution to civil war: militarization, increased sectarianism, and fragmentation of the opposition. I review two mechanisms of international arms control: multilateral embargoes and the recent Arms Trade Treaty. Their weaknesses, as evident in the case of Syria, are related to the problems of self-monitoring and enforcement by states that have contradictory incentives. Next, I address the related issue of surplus arms by looking at how the failure of disarmament measures in Iraq and Libya had a direct impact on arms proliferation in Syria. I conclude with a discussion of the legality of arms transfers to non-state actors and the need to focus on political rather than military solutions to globalized conflict.",Libya,17.228331,26.3351,2

Global and International Studies",Global and International Studies,"Richard Falk, Eve Darian-Smith","This thesis examines recent academic literature about Libya and media reports on the 2011 Libyan revolution to uncover the ways in which reductionist, stereotypical, and Orientalizing language is prevalent in the construction of Western knowledge about Libya. I borrow post-structural discourse analysis' method of looking at language to illustrate how recent academic and media discourses about Libya open up and close down particular Libyan identities, both by linking certain negative characteristics (uncivilized, undemocratic, violent, pre-modern, homogenous) together and by differentiating those characteristics against a preferred, Westernized identity (democratic, liberal, civilized, modern, rational). I examine these discourses through the lens of Orientalism, arguing that contemporary media has been guilty of using language that positions Libyan tribes as backwards and pre-modern. Media and academic discourses on Libya parallel each other in significant and troubling ways. In some cases, this was the result of the direct participation of academic Libya 'experts' in the media analysis of the revolution, in many other cases Orientalizing language and stereotypical assumptions came from media outlets themselves. These parallels and the enduring prevalence of certain stereotypes indicate that homogenizing and inaccurate language concerning Libya is, in many cases, a systemic problem. In media discourse especially, this language suggests not only an unwillingness to add clarifying qualifiers to unconfirmed or unconfirmable 'facts,' but also an urge to simplify complex narratives and social realities for a American or Western audience. I argue that a deeper understanding of Libyan history and culture, and a dramatic shift away from polarizing language are absolutely critical to the reworking of 'truths' about Libya and Libyan tribes. In concluding, this thesis calls for a new language concerning tribal peoples, the incorporation of both Libyan scholars and indigenous voices into academic discourses, and a move towards Libya scholarship that is not as tied to Western geo-political interests as the scholarship outlined in this thesis proves to be.",Libya,17.228331,26.3351,2

English",English,Enda Duffy,"This dissertation is an interdisciplinary examination of medicine, politics, and culture that explores how health and security became inextricably entangled throughout the long twentieth century. I also perform a disciplinary critique by resituating modernism and science fiction within a cultural history of biopolitics. I reconstruct an assemblage of secondary texts in medical, social, and political science driven by archival research in digitized medical journals, as well as at the Wellcome Library in London and the Wyndham Lewis Collection at Cornell. I read this archive through modernist and science fictions, tracing the emergence of a violent logic of self-defense that imbricates the discourses of health and security, naturalizing sociopolitical, racial, and national differences. I trace across cultural production common themes, figures, and anxieties associated with this entangling of health and security, a set of epistemologies which I call ""antibody aesthetics."" These antibody aesthetics revolve around liminal figures whose exclusion serves to define and delimit imagined communities. I historicize the development of these aesthetics in relation to biopolitical discourse and governance, examining them throughout novels such as Woolf's Mrs. Dalloway (1926), Ellison's Invisible Man (1952), and Coetzee's Life and Times of Michael K. (1983), popular films such as the Halperin brothers' White Zombie (1932), and science fiction novels including Richard Matheson's I am Legend (1954) and Max Brooks' World War Z (2006). Methodologically, I draw upon interdisciplinary work in the Medical Humanities, Science and Technology Studies (STS), and related fields. The project analyzes scientific journals, works in social science and social theory, cultural criticism and theory, and cultural productions. I make three interventions in this project. I recontextualize modernist and science fictions, demonstrating their shared development of antibody aesthetics, and noting structural, thematic, and discursive similarities as a result. I offer a new genealogy of biopolitics that contextualizes the term's emergence in 1911 in relation to the use of biomedicine in governance, and the increasing use of political metaphor in biomedical conceptualizations. Finally, I demonstrate how contemporary preoccupations with bioinsecurity and terror, exemplified in the popularity of the zombie in culture, have their roots in medical, political, and cultural developments beginning in the 1880s.",London,-0.1277583,51.5073509,10

History of Art and Architecture",History of Art and Architecture,Bruce Robertson,"Paradox of Elitism: Vision, Risk, and Diplomacy in the European Career of Colonel John Trumbull (1756-1843) reconsiders Trumbull's life and works within the context of the eighteenth-century Federalist political ethos, American foreign policy, and nationalist trends of the Neoclassical academic style through the War of 1812. Articulating Trumbull as a Smithian ""economic man"" through five chapters, this study explores his artistic practice as the foundation and formulation, but also the failure, of a conservative Federalist aesthetic that was usurped when a more radical Democratic-Republicanism became the dominant cultural discourse in the first decades of the nineteenth century. Deeply faithful to Alexander Hamilton, Trumbull saw himself fulfilling the proper role of the public American artist, embracing the so-called 'invisible hand' of the market to facilitate his vision. Trumbull, like the Federalists, faded into unpopularity in the first decades of the nineteenth century, but given his prominence in the Federalist community, he, much more than the decidedly neutral Gilbert Stuart, ought to be credited as the inventor of Federalist vision---the politically-infused synthetic Neoclassicism that expressed the fair rule of the executive few over the following many. The dissertation's first two chapters reassess Trumbull's early life through his service in the Continental Army, and to his mysterious first trip to Europe, on which he took part in a secret plot with Benjamin Franklin, entered artistic study in London with Benjamin West, was arrested on suspicion of espionage, imprisoned, and eventually granted freedom. The third and fourth chapters follow Trumbull through the most imaginative and productive phase of his career, between 1784 and 1789, and explore the ways in which Trumbull merged the nationalizing styles of academic Neoclassicism in Great Britain and France, with continually evolving academic theories of art and his own rational, commercial view of the world that reduced the idea of history to variables of risk and profit. The product was Trumbull's own synthetic modes of historical painting and portraiture. The final chapter of this work examines the ways in which Trumbull, in his dual roles as an American diplomat and a picture-dealer in Europe in the 1790s, attempted to integrate risk management, United States foreign policy, and connoisseurship into his Federalist political enterprise.",London,-0.1277583,51.5073509,10

History of Art and Architecture",History of Art and Architecture,Ann Bermingham,"Frederic Leighton is inextricably linked to the ""classical"" movement in late Victorian art. However, long before he was a classicist, Leighton's oeuvre was dominated by subjects from the late medieval/early Renaissance periods. The roots of Leighton's mature classicism are to be found in his so-called ""gothic"" works of this early period [c. 1846 (the date of his enrollment in the Stadelshes Kunstinstitut in Frankfurt, Germany) to 1864 (the date of his election as an Associate of the Royal Academy of Arts in London)], a period wherein he enjoyed a continued and direct exposure to the art of Italy, Germany, and France. A detailed accounting of Leighton's formative years and the profound effect exercised by his experience of the art of continental Europe is lacking. While art historians acknowledge that Leighton's work is much more complex than a simple reading might suggest, they invariably focus on his mature classicizing works. Leighton, however, viewed his works---be they from his ""gothic"" period or his ""classical"" period---as part of one continuum. Modern commentators routinely overlook this fact and divide his career into distinct periods. It is this compartmentalized view that this dissertation seeks to counter. Leighton's art is the product of a unique and highly selective process that would only have been conceivable in the context of his early cosmopolitan artistic experiences. An understanding of the circumstances that led to the formation of his early works elucidates the process whereby he developed a direct, transnational, and ultimately modern formulation of classicism centered on formal concerns. This dissertation examines Leighton's early career in the context of (1) his encounter with the art of the early Italian Renaissance and the art and artists of the German Nazarene movement; (2) the reception of his early works in Europe and America; (3) his encounter with French neoclassicism; and (4) its implications for his mature classicism.",London,-0.1277583,51.5073509,10

Political Science",Political Science,Bruce Bimber,"These results reveal the small window of opportunity protesters have to attract public support before news attention wanes and underscore the importance of protester tactics in shaping the narratives of coverage. Protesters have to strategically weigh the costs of confrontational tactics because such tactics can elicit more news attention to the protest, but these tactics might overshadow the core message of the protest itself. To identify the frame-changing dynamic occurring over time, I conducted a content analysis of the news coverage of Occupy Wall Street and the G20 protests in London, Pittsburgh and Toronto. The study identifies longitudinal changes in news frames about the substantive issues of a protest and the conflict that ensues between protesters and city officials during a protest. Findings suggest that conflict has a significant impact on the number of news stories about protests. Further, the results demonstrate how news framing opportunities change as a movement reaches different stages of the news attention cycle. The cases studied here illustrate that when the protests grew, journalists focused on the protesters' grievances, including economic inequality, bank bailouts, ending the Iraq War, and climate change. As the movements peaked, news attention shifted to the intensifying conflict between city officials and protesters. Ultimately, prolonged conflict is typically followed by a decline in protest news interest. When protests are successful, they force us to realize another world is possible. To be successful they have to communicate their message effectively and be persuasive. News coverage can often determine whether a protest will be successful or unsuccessful at amplifying its message and persuading audiences. This dissertation examines the relationship of news organizations and protest movements. It asks three primary research questions. First, how does news attention to a protest rise and fall over time? Second, do news organizations pay attention to the causes and grievances of protesters? Third, how does news framing of a protest change over time? To answer these questions, I develop a theoretical model, the protest news framing cycle, and present the results of a longitudinal analysis of news attention and framing of protest movements.",London,-0.1277583,51.5073509,10

Theater Studies",Theater Studies,Christina McMahon,"Between 1997 and 2001, Shakespeare's Globe Theatre invited troupes from South Africa, Cuba, India, Brazil, and Japan to present translations of Shakespearean plays on its London stage. Known as the ""Globe to Globe"" series, this set of productions received ambivalent and sometimes condescending reviews from British critics who did not understand the translation languages or performance conventions. Taking these reviews to encapsulate the productions' reception, scholars have agreed that the series reinforced hegemonic hierarchies between spectators and performers. They argue that the displacement to London rendered the performances' original meanings unintelligible; further, that this dislocation stimulated national superiority in British spectators who measured the performances against their expectations of Shakespeare and their tourist-like desires to witness an exotic Other. However, this perspective obscures both the agency of the performers as participants in the encounter and the diversity of audience response, presenting a fatalistic view of touring performance. I argue that that in a performance across language and culture, failures in understanding do not indicate the failure of the event; rather, they can provoke spectators to suspend their preconceptions and negotiate new relationships. Reading professional reviews against the grain and placing them in conversation with video records and other documentation of the mass audiences' reactions, I suggest that the productions subverted the tourist gaze by resisting easy comprehension. As translation and 'foreign' performance conventions reshaped famous texts, the productions undermined audiences' expectations of both Shakespeare and the culture onstage. Confronted with the limits of their knowledge, spectators improvised new strategies of viewing, learning habits of listening and questioning that challenged cultural hierarchies. These events further undermined dominant power dynamics by attracting audiences from London's diasporic communities and privileging their knowledge and reactions over those of the normative British spectator. This trend intensified in 2012, when the Globe to Globe concept was revived as a massive festival for audiences containing many translation-language speakers.

Chicana and Chicano Studies",Chicana and Chicano Studies,"Miroslava Chavez-Garcia, Dolores I. Casillas","My research examines early twentieth-century immigration policies focusing on the experience of ""repatriation"" that tore apart Mexican and Mexican American families throughout the United States. It considers this historical moment as the ""banishment"" of U.S. citizens of Mexican descent to foreground the difference between repatriation, which implies that the person is not a citizen of a given country and banishment, referring to citizens who are banned from their home country. This discursive difference challenges much of the literature that refers to these banishments as ""repatriations"", obscuring the systematic racist and exclusionist immigration policies. The legal, social, and cultural ramifications of banishment on second and third generation descendants of U.S. citizens are largely absent in Chicana/o-Latina/o historiographies and immigration legal studies. My work takes an innovative approach in that it focuses on the prolonged consequences of immigration policies on surviving banished U.S. citizens and their descendants and the link to today's growing legally mixed-status households across the United States. My study demonstrates that U.S. immigration policies continue to ignore the long and complex Mexico-U.S. immigration relations, failing to create adequate paths to legalization for old and new generations of Mexican immigrants. This study centers on the experiences of banishment of three extended families and uses their oral histories across multiple generations to recover and rewrite the history of forced exclusion. The families are composed of surviving U.S. citizens who were banished during the early twentieth century and/or who are descendants of those survivors who have returned to the United States, some as undocumented immigrants. The participating families include the Yanez family, residing in Anaheim, California; the Molina family, spread throughout California, Alabama, and Mexico; and the Robles family, living in Pasadena, California. To allow for personal accounts as well as communal- or family-based interpretations, each family member is interviewed individually and then the entire family is interviewed collectively, providing for a multiplicity of insights and richly texture points of views. In addition to oral histories, this study mines the families' archives, which are composed of photographs, letters, and legal records detailing the experiences of banishment over the course of the twentieth century. Institutional records, including legal histories, archival materials, and demographic data housed at the National Archives in Washington D.C. and the regional branches in Los Angeles, California, as well as El Paso, Texas are used to contextualize the primary research and to reconstruct and reinterpret the immigration policies of the time. My study indicates that these families experienced repatriation in very unique ways, but with a common sense of contempt that extends across family generations, and continue to face real legal and social collateral consequences. My findings demonstrate that an almost 90-year-old unofficial, later becoming official, policy continues to classify direct descendents of banished U.S. citizens as ""illegal"" immigrants in their parents and grandparents' home country. Banishment has resulted in what I term, a transgenerational illegality, which has been nearly impossible to shake. These findings are crucial at a time where immigration remains central to national debates. The twenty original oral histories collected for this study demonstrate that, despite the subjugation of these families, the descendants found ways to challenge their ""illegal"" status, giving rise to the concept of a contested illegality..",Los Angeles,-118.2436849,34.0522342,44

Geography",Geography,Dar Roberts,"Most of the existing techniques for detecting, quantifying, and attributing point source emissions of methane (CH4) have relied on ground-based measurements. These methods are limited either by their spatial resolution or temporal coverage, which makes identifying the location of individual sources challenging. By combining large image footprints and fine spatial resolution, airborne imaging spectrometers offer the potential to permit direct attribution of emissions to individual point sources. As part of a controlled release experiment, AVIRIS-NG was flown at multiple flight altitudes and methane flux rates to determine its sensitivity for methane detection. From these results, detection rates were calculated for multiple flux rates and indicate a detection threshold around 3.4 cubic meters per hour (0.02 kt/year). Given this threshold, AVIRIS-NG has the potential to detect a number of fugitive methane source categories for natural gas fields. Ongoing analysis of AVIRIS-NG scenes over oil and gas fields indicates multiple methane plumes, further emphasizing the utility of imaging spectrometers for direct attribution of methane emissions. This dissertation explores the potential of using imaging spectrometers like the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and the next generation sensor (AVIRIS-NG) for high resolution mapping of emissions and quantification of methane concentrations present within scenes. To do so, non-quantitative filtering methods and quantitative methane retrievals were adapted for use with AVIRIS and AVIRIS-NG scenes over both marine and terrestrial environments. These techniques were applied to scenes acquired at natural marine methane seeps (Coal Oil Point, COP) and for natural and anthropogenic sources in the Los Angeles Basin. At these locations, distinct plumes consistent with local wind direction were observed.

Geography",Geography,Joseph P. McFadden,"Urban irrigation is a crucial component that influences urban water use budgets, particularly in Mediterranean climate cities where water availability is limited during dry summers. The main function of urban irrigation is to maintain landscape vegetation greenness and growth. The objectives of this study were (1) to examine the relationships and distributions among urban vegetation greenness, irrigated areas, and irrigation rates within single-family residential (SFR) areas; and (2) to assess irrigation rates via landscape vegetation water demand to better understand trends of SFR water consumption. A time series of SPOT 5 satellite images (10-m resolution) was used to derive a Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI) thresholding approach for mapping irrigated areas in connection with monthly SFR water billing records for 2005-2007 in the City of Los Angeles, California. The water needs for landscape vegetation were estimated using a vegetation water demand model that included climate, vegetation, and irrigated areas variables. A water conservation ratio was calculated to elucidate the relationships between irrigation and vegetation water demand, and to assess spatio-temporal patterns of SFR outdoor water consumption. The lower vegetation greenness suggested that vegetation was enduring water-stress conditions even though estimated outdoor water consumption is typically highest in dry years. The distributions of irrigated areas, irrigation rates and vegetation greenness revealed distinct patterns of land lot sizes owned by SFR households within different areas. The results from the relationship between irrigation rates, vegetation water demand and vegetation greenness highlighted the potential applications of household irrigation systems and selection of landscape vegetation species. The irrigation rates were influenced by climate variability through different water years (i.e., precipitation and ETo). The water conservation ratio could also detect over-irrigation conditions spatially from different SFR land lot sizes, and incorporate a vegetation water demand approach.",Los Angeles,-118.2436849,34.0522342,44

Geography",Geography,Fernando Bosco,"This dissertation is a mixed methods case study of the Residential Renaissance of Downtown Los Angeles. This revitalization of the residential community was spawned by the passage of an Adaptive Reuse Ordinance by the Los Angeles City Council in 1999 enabling developers to renovate underutilized and abandoned office and commercial buildings into apartments and lofts. The first apartments renovated under this ordinance were ready for occupancy in August 2000. Following the initial success of the pioneering developers thousands of rental lofts and condominiums were constructed in the next seven years resulting in a glut of unoccupied housing units by 2008. This case study utilized a Urban Regime theoretical framework to analyze the type of regime coalition that enabled this revitalization. Data collection included archival research of Census data, government documents, business and non-profit organization reports, and newspaper and magazine articles. Active research encompassed personal interviews, focus groups and a mail survey to residents in condominiums in the Historic Core area of Downtown considered the genesis of the Residential Renaissance. Analysis of the data indicates that the City of Los Angeles has a multi-faceted urban regime coalition based upon the land use powers vested in the fifteen city council districts by the city charter. Another finding suggests that the Downtown area can be divided into spatial amenity zones that are better suited for analysis rather than the traditional districts utilized by the city planning department. A third finding indicates that the demographic group targeted by the revitalization efforts of the city, the Creative Class as identified by Richard Florida, would be better served by rental housing instead of for-sale condominiums.

Geography",Geography,Dar Roberts,"Most of the existing techniques for detecting, quantifying, and attributing point source emissions of methane (CH4) have relied on ground-based measurements. These methods are limited either by their spatial resolution or temporal coverage, which makes identifying the location of individual sources challenging. By combining large image footprints and fine spatial resolution, airborne imaging spectrometers offer the potential to permit direct attribution of emissions to individual point sources. As part of a controlled release experiment, AVIRIS-NG was flown at multiple flight altitudes and methane flux rates to determine its sensitivity for methane detection. From these results, detection rates were calculated for multiple flux rates and indicate a detection threshold around 3.4 cubic meters per hour (0.02 kt/year). Given this threshold, AVIRIS-NG has the potential to detect a number of fugitive methane source categories for natural gas fields. Ongoing analysis of AVIRIS-NG scenes over oil and gas fields indicates multiple methane plumes, further emphasizing the utility of imaging spectrometers for direct attribution of methane emissions. This dissertation explores the potential of using imaging spectrometers like the Airborne Visible/Infrared Imaging Spectrometer (AVIRIS) and the next generation sensor (AVIRIS-NG) for high resolution mapping of emissions and quantification of methane concentrations present within scenes. To do so, non-quantitative filtering methods and quantitative methane retrievals were adapted for use with AVIRIS and AVIRIS-NG scenes over both marine and terrestrial environments. These techniques were applied to scenes acquired at natural marine methane seeps (Coal Oil Point, COP) and for natural and anthropogenic sources in the Los Angeles Basin. At these locations, distinct plumes consistent with local wind direction were observed. As part of this study, I developed methods of reducing noise and false positives in results.",Los Angeles,-118.2436849,34.0522342,44

River but it also proposed graffiti's agentive potential to expand the experiences and functions of the marginalized river. Socially, the event discerned a fuller range of constituents in graffiti's production. Spatially, it assembled a number of contradictions and agreements about graffiti practices and forms at a particular site.

Sociology",Sociology,William I. Robinson,"Policing the Wretched examines the transnationalization of systems of racism, class exploitation, criminalization, militarized policing, and social control throughout North and Central America in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century. It provides a sociological, historical, and materialist analysis of the militarization of the Los Angeles Police Department, the policing of youth and surplus labor populations in El Salvador, the so-called ""war on drugs"" in Mexico, and the emergence of hip hop as a cultural form of expression in the heavily policed Pico Union district of Los Angeles to conceptualize what I call ""transnational apparatuses of social control"". It demonstrates that during the epoch of global capitalism, repressive nation-state apparatuses have taken transnational dimensions. It shows that these forms of social control should be understood alongside neoliberal policies such as structural adjustments programs (SAPs) and free trade policies, and the proposed ""wars"" on drugs, crime, gangs, terrorism, and anti-migrant policies in this region. It illustrates that the transnationalization of social control emerged as a response to social and economic crises that have developed from neoliberalism, racial and social inequality, and the emergence of grassroots social movements. While remaining attentive to the repressive apparatuses of social control in a transnational context, Policing the Wretched also examines how social movements in Los Angeles, Mexico City, and San Salvador have contested neoliberal policies, security initiatives, and militarization. Through interviews, participant observations, and archival research (government documents, congressional reports, and studies; presidential addresses; media sources and journalist accounts; and non-governmental literature, studies, and research) spanning three countries, the project traces the ways in which social movements in the U.S., Mexico, and El Salvador have mobilized and waged a relentless struggle over hegemony that provides an alternative social warrant that places democracy over securitization and human rights over property rights.

Sociology",Sociology,"Richard Flacks, G. Reginald Daniel","This dissertation examines La Contra Cultura (the Counter Culture), a musical movement centered in East Los Angeles which utilizes art as a cultural weapon. I use a theoretical framework that incorporates inequalities, social movements, and sociology of culture/popular culture, to do grounded, qualitative, analytic work focusing on oppositional consciousness, decolonization, and identity and community-building within the area of ethno-cultural music, art, and performance. Stemming from my fieldwork, I describe in detail the Contra Cultura, a mix of musicians, artists, vendors, organizers, and urban sacred sites, which examine native and indigenous history, challenge 500 years of colonization, and promotes an urban indigenous identity to challenge systems of racial oppression and white privilege. I then analyze the lyrics of over 400 songs to construct a decolonial pedagogy. The messages contained within the song lyrics address the legacies of colonization by building indigenous history, expressing a self conscious challenge to Eurocentric domination, and promotes the reclaiming of indigenous cultural thought to construct an urban indigenous identity. The dissertation then uses ethnographic data to understand live performance as ceremonies of resistance. At these urban ceremonies, musical performance is geared at creating autonomous communities by allowing participants to think critically about their lives while creating community history through a shared relationship to oppression. The concepts of Decolonial Imagination and Wombyn Warriors are then developed. Using case studies and in depth interviews, I explore the decolonial imagination through the work of Aztlan Underground and Olmeca. These two artists combine critical pedagogy and the Sociological Imagination to help their audiences understand their subjective realities within the objective conditions of capitalism and neo colonialism. The concept of the wombyn warrior is constructed by looking at the work of In Lak Ech, Cihuatl Ce, and the Guerrilla Queenz. These femc's use music as a tool to construct new visions of femininity, challenge colonized views of traditional womanhood, and promote cultural affirmation through the birthing of art, poetry, music, and teatro.",Los Angeles,-118.2436849,34.0522342,44

Sociology",Sociology,George Lipsitz,"In this thesis I document, describe and analyze the reconfigurations of space in East Los Angeles with punk rock cultures, particularly the backyard punk scene from 1998-2008. In the processes of reconfiguration privately oriented and policed places are transformed into public oriented punk rock social spaces. With a focus on punk rock culture that includes music, gig organization and travel to gigs I look into the creation of multiple forms of social space where aggrieved persons can construct uplifting identities and form new subjectivities and solidarities with others. Through an ethnographic methodology I reveal how the social spatial and cultural production of gigs creates new discursive and physical sites of congregation and mutual aid. Interviews with participants of the backyard scene reveal that by attending to their needs, desires and imaginations they actively take part in a continuing practice of social protest in East Los Angeles. Accompanying the Skums on their travels to and from backyard gigs I reveal that in East Los Angeles punk rock is not only about music, but also about constructing methods of reaching and returning from backyard gigs. The spatial relations I witnessed reveal that Chicanas/os and Latinas/os face unfair consequences like other impoverished classes whose presence in the public sphere brings with it suspicion and criminalization. The stakes of the unpaid labors that make up punk rock in East Los Angeles are complex. East Los Angeles cultural actors work diligently to materialize a range of desires that in effect offset the lack of city and state funded public spaces in their neighborhoods and make segregation into congregation with use value orientations to space and cultures of punk rock.",Los Angeles,-118.2436849,34.0522342,44

Using feminist, queer, and performance theories in conjunction with previously restricted archival material, original ethnography, and personal interviews, this dissertation illustrates how some acts of gender-bending partially or wholly escape the limiting but central definitional parameter of sex identity. The term ""gender-bending"" traditionally characterizes how an actor of one distinct, binary sex (male or female) performs a gendered illusion that fundamentally differs from his or her own ""real"" identity. A drag queen might be described as an actor who appears as a woman onstage but is, ""in actuality,"" a man. This dissertation investigates a broad range of so-called female-bodied gender-bending practices such as male impersonation in U.S. variety and vaudeville (1868-1920), androgynous cross-casting by El Teatro Campesino's teatristas (1968-1980), and contemporary drag kinging events in Los Angeles and San Francisco, CA (2008-2012).

By investigating gender-bending intents, methods, and outcomes in the commercial venue, the civil rights struggle, and the queer domain, this dissertation demonstrates how and also why certain gender-bending strategies identify, revision, or disidentify the performer's body within the gendered performance. Based on these examples, I propose that the term gender-bending should be resignifed to encompass a myriad of non-normative identity acts such as ""female-femmeing"" and ""body-breaking."" In doing so, this term may also be used by academics and practitioners to characterize and discuss the potential in acts that express any or all social identities as unstable, including the relationship between the performer's body and the performance of identity.",Los Angeles,-118.2436849,34.0522342,44

The performance stages within these spaces became theaters for drag queens, actors and other performers to speak to the values and struggles of their audiences, while the dance floors granted patrons license to embody the meaning of songs and to renew themselves through improvised movement. These businesses incubated new subcultures like disco clones, lipstick lesbians, fetish queers, and queer punks that represented interventions in gay and lesbian identities. Through interviews, periodicals and extant club artifacts, I reconstruct the narratives of these entertainments not only to establish the legacy of their artists and entrepreneurs, but also to expose the mechanism by which gay nightlife has transformed sexual norms and popular culture in the United States. This dissertation examines how the gay and lesbian communities of Los Angeles have deployed nightlife to define, contest and promote themselves in the years following the birth of gay liberation. The circulation of bodies throughout the club space demonstrated the agency of participants in their interactions with various artists as well as the potential for creative and sexual connections among individuals. Gay clubs constitute spectators as co-producers of entertainment with paid performers, and empower political dissenters and sexual deviants to experiment with performance modes and corporeal experiences. Within the artistic and social laboratories of the clubs, these performances of glamour and deviance interrogated queerness and heteronormativity alike and functioned as catalysts for radical change in nightlife and beyond.",Los Angeles,-118.2436849,34.0522342,44

By investigating gender-bending intents, methods, and outcomes in the commercial venue, the civil rights struggle, and the queer domain, this dissertation demonstrates how and also why certain gender-bending strategies identify, revision, or disidentify the performer's body within the gendered performance. Based on these examples, I propose that the term gender-bending should be resignifed to encompass a myriad of non-normative identity acts such as ""female-femmeing"" and ""body-breaking."" In doing so, this term may also be used by academics and practitioners to characterize and discuss the potential in acts that express any or all social identities as unstable, including the relationship between the performer's body and the performance of identity.",Los Angeles,-118.2436849,34.0522342,44

Theater Studies",Theater Studies,Ninotchka D. Bennahum,"The last five decades marked the golden age of gay nightlife as bars and clubs served as the primary social venues for marginalized gay men and lesbians in Los Angeles. The performance stages within these spaces became theaters for drag queens, actors and other performers to speak to the values and struggles of their audiences, while the dance floors granted patrons license to embody the meaning of songs and to renew themselves through improvised movement. These businesses incubated new subcultures like disco clones, lipstick lesbians, fetish queers, and queer punks that represented interventions in gay and lesbian identities. Through interviews, periodicals and extant club artifacts, I reconstruct the narratives of these entertainments not only to establish the legacy of their artists and entrepreneurs, but also to expose the mechanism by which gay nightlife has transformed sexual norms and popular culture in the United States. This dissertation examines how the gay and lesbian communities of Los Angeles have deployed nightlife to define, contest and promote themselves in the years following the birth of gay liberation. The circulation of bodies throughout the club space demonstrated the agency of participants in their interactions with various artists as well as the potential for creative and sexual connections among individuals. Gay clubs constitute spectators as co-producers of entertainment with paid performers, and empower political dissenters and sexual deviants to experiment with performance modes and corporeal experiences. Within the artistic and social laboratories of the clubs, these performances of glamour and deviance interrogated queerness and heteronormativity alike and functioned as catalysts for radical change in nightlife and beyond.",Los Angeles,-118.2436849,34.0522342,44

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Jordan F. Clark,"California guidelines for recycled water reuse currently give preference to groundwater tracers to determine underground retention time, with a target retention time of >6 months from infiltration to drinking water extraction. Two prospective tracers were evaluated here: boron-10 (10B, the lesser abundant boron stable isotope), and heat (with recharging water warmed at sewage treatment plants and by solar radiation in surface-spreading basins). Bromide (Br-), a conservative deliberate salt tracer with limitations to low-volume settings, was released as a control. Tracer injection occurred when 3 kg of 10B-enriched boric acid and 36 kg of NaBr were added to the research test basin at San Gabriel Spreading Grounds, part of the Montebello Forebay, Los Angeles County, CA, USA. Recycled wastewater was piped directly to this basin at a rate of 2200 m3/day for ~two continuous months. 10B and Br- tracer breakthroughs were observed at seven monitoring wells ranging from directly beneath the basin floor to 150 m downgradient. Travel times ranged from 0.7 to 40 days. Arrival of Br- to each well was always coincident or preceded 10B arrival, reflecting retardation of 10B presumably due to exchange with clay surfaces. 10B/Br - travel time ratios determined from the center of mass ranged from 1 to 1.4. Travel times were successfully determined to all wells. Peak matching of diurnal variations was only possible at the nearest well (<1 day travel time). Basic analysis of temperature measurements, even in the absence of peak matching, yielded a reliable estimate of the underground residence time. Heat has great potential as an intrinsic tracer for managed recharge applications. Based on average tracer travel times, a vertical flow line directly below the test basin had an average vertical velocity of 3.3 m/day, equivalent to a recharge rate of 0.8 m/day.",Los Angeles County,-118.2436596,34.0522265,44

Cuatro dramatizaciones de novelas cervantinas,2012,"Villa Fernandez de Castro, Elena","University of California, Santa Barbara. Spanish and Portuguese",Spanish and Portuguese,Jorge Checa,"This dissertation focuses on four comedias based on four of the most famous of Cervantes's novellas. I examine Guillen de Castro's El curioso impertinente (1606), Antonio de Solis's La gitanilla de Madrid (1671), Antonio de Coello's El celoso extremeno (1634 ) and La ilustre fregona y el amante al uso (1641), adscribed to Lope de Vega. Using a methodology based on intertext, I analyze the multiple changes, which occurred through the dramatization of these novellas. Particular emphasis is placed on the conventions of drama as a performing art as well as on the ideological roles commonly attributed to 17th century Spanish theatre. In contrast to the plays inspired by them, Cervantes's novellas present a critical component as they put into question the behavior of the ruling elites and condemn their complacent self-image. I argue that the plays, in turn, tend to be overtly conservative in their support of the status quo represented by the King, the nobility, and the Catholic Church. This dissertation is comprised of four main chapters, each one centered on a different comedia. In La ilustre fregona (The Ilustrous Kitchen Maid) and La gitanila de Madrid (The Little Gypsy of Madrid) Cervantes intermixes realistic and idealized scenes; by doing so he undermines the traditional conventions of the romance genre, whereas the comedias produce a more homogenous effect through the suppression of socially disruptive elements. The last two chapters concentrate on two stage adaptations of ""El curioso impertinente"" (""The Curious-Impertinent""), a short story inserted in Don Quijote, Part 1, and El celoso extremeno (The Jealeous Extremaduran). In both novellas the depiction of extreme cases of marital jealousy leads to a deep scrutiny of issues concerning female autonomy, free will, and human responsibility, which are almost obliterated in the comedias. By emphasizing instead the transcendental action of the Divine Providence and offering a predictable outcome, these dramatic versions sacrifice the complexity of Cervantes's moral vision---here replaced by theatrical plot devices adjusted to the tastes and beliefs of the audience.",Madrid,-3.7037902,40.4167754,3

Economics",Economics,Robert T. Deacon,"Institutions, as mechanisms of social order, often constrain the behavior of individuals within a society. Political institutions constrain the behavior of politicians, financial institutions constrain the behavior of businesses and payment processors and social institutions often constrain the behavior of individuals. These institutions often play an important role in constraining activities that may be seen as illicit or unwanted and careful analysis of these constraints can allow researchers to learn more about activities that are often hidden or go unreported. This dissertation explores the role of institutional constraints on unwanted behavior by studying deforestation in Brazil and Malawi as well as underground activity in fraudulent software sales. These cases share the commonality that they are influenced by institutional constraints. Politicians in Brazil are constrained by reelection incentives, perpetrators of fraudulent antivirus software are constrained by payment processors and the cultural practice of ethnic favoritism in public good provision leads to particular ethnic groups in Malawi receiving much more fertilizer subsidies than others. The first chapter examines deforestation in Brazil. Local political authority (formal or informal) over natural resources may create rents for politicians. The political decision to use or allocate resources involves balancing private rents with reelection prospects. I examine the case of deforestation in Brazil and a presidential decree granting the federal government the authority to punish counties that failed to limit total deforestation within their borders. This collective punishment aimed to generate pressure on local politicians to slow deforestation. Using binding term limits as a source of variation in reelection eligibility, I find eligibility has no effect on deforestation prior to the decree. After the decree, reelection eligible mayors reduced annual deforestation 10% more than mayors ineligible for reelection. These findings are consistent with the equilibrium outcome of a lobbying model. Policies such as sanctions, which target the electorate in order to influence political behavior, may be less effective when politicians are not accountable to voters. The second chapter examines Fake antivirus (AV) programs which have been utilized to defraud millions of computer users into paying as much as one hundred dollars for a phony software license. As a result, fake AV software has evolved into one of the most lucrative criminal operations on the Internet. In this chapter, we examine the operations of three large scale fake AV businesses, lasting from three months to more than two years. More precisely, we present the results of our analysis on a trove of data obtained from several backend servers that the cybercriminals used to drive their scam operations. Our investigations reveal that these three fake AV businesses had earned a combined revenue of more than $130 million dollars. A particular focus of our analysis is on the financial and economic aspects of the scam, which involves legitimate credit card networks as well as more dubious payment processors. In particular, we present an economic model that demonstrates that fake AV companies are actively monitoring the refunds (chargebacks) that customers demand from their credit card providers. When the number of chargebacks increases in a short interval, the fake AV companies react to customer complaints by granting more refunds. This lowers the rate of chargebacks and ensures that a fake AV company can stay in business for a longer period of time. However, this behavior also leads to unusual patterns in chargebacks, which can potentially be leveraged by vigilant payment processors and credit card companies to identify and ban fraudulent firms. This chapter is joint work with Brett Stone-Gross, Richard Kremmerer, Christopher Kruegel, Douglas Steigerwald, and Giovanni Vigna and was published as Stone-Gross et al. (2013). The final chapter returns to deforestation and studies it in the context of agriculture in Malawi. The effect of development policies on the environment is often ambiguous ex ante. Programs designed to improve agricultural productivity may increase deforestation by raising the marginal productivity of agricultural land, thus increasing the demand for land clearing. However, in a setting of subsistence farming on unproductive land, increasing agricultural productivity may reduce the need to shift cultivation to maintain the desired yields. This chapter examines the impact of agricultural subsidies on deforestation in Malawi by leveraging ethnic favoritism in government resource allocation. By exploiting a change in the ethnicity of the Malawi president following the 2004 election, we show that coethnic districts received more fertilizer subsidies and experienced significant declines in deforestation compared to districts with other predominant ethnicities. This paper studies a case in which poverty alleviation programs have beneficial environ- mental impacts demonstrating that, in certain contexts, input subsidies may provide a 'win-win' scenario.

Political Science",Political Science,Benjamin J. Cohen,"This dissertation examines the negotiation processes of financial and monetary cooperation in East Asia since the 1997--1998 Asian financial crisis, which have been understudied. The purpose of this study is to explore the various strategies and tactics that helped to shape particular agreement details, in order to provide more insight to our understanding of the dynamics of international economic negotiations. Since the conventional three levels of analysis of International Relations cannot tell which specific outcome may be selected, a problem of multiple equilibria results. I contend that negotiators' bargaining strategies and tactics can solve a multiple equilibria problem as they help explain the specific details of outcomes. This research uses the recent agreement to multilateralize the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMIM), with particular emphasis on the issues of members' financial contributions and vote shares, to analyze negotiation processes. Due to data inaccessibility problems and financial constraints, I chose to focus on five of the most influential players in the CMIM negotiations---Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. It should be noted that China, though it was an important actor in the CMIM negotiations, is not included in my analysis due to a lack of direct access to Chinese sources. Extensive archival research and in-depth interviews were employed to collect data. Process tracing was a method of analysis. My investigation of the CMIM negotiations reveals that the member states employed several bargaining elements to alter final outcome. States with a lower discount rate (a lower sense of urgency) and a more attractive best alternative to no agreement (batna) were able to walk away with more favorable terms than those with a higher discount rate and less attractive batna. Also, possessing knowledge about other actors' preferences or about issues being discussed (expertise) enhanced states' relative bargaining leverage. Countries took advantage of being a co-chair of the negotiation to turn the agreement terms in their favor. In some circumstances, countries strategically linked issues under negotiation to reap concessions from the others. Additionally, forming a coalition or preventing a coalition of other states from forming sometimes helped states achieve their objectives.",Malaysia,101.975766,4.210484,1

Sociology",Sociology,Kum-Kum Bhavnani,"My doctoral dissertation examines how rising seas and a recently renewed interest in the construction of seawalls illustrate a form of development that involves substantial labor, financing, and materials in addition to hidden social and environmental costs. More generally, the research looks at the moving borders of the sea driven by the complex dynamics of anthropogenic climate change in which twenty-five million to one billion people will be affected by the year 2050. I draw upon theoretical approaches that consider climate-related issues to be macro-social processes involving global and international relations as well as matters of lived experience involving people in contexts where material and cultural histories shape climate change resiliency. Using the methods of global ethnography, I address the problem of coastal vulnerability by focusing on the cultural and social dynamics of coastal development and sea change in Guyana, The Maldives, Venice and the Netherlands, highlighting issues that emerge in places where seawalls are already important fixtures in the landscape. Analysis across these sites reveals how the threat of rising seas involves multiple axes of inequality formed within the contexts of colonialism, development, and globalization over the past one hundred years. Seawalls and other coastal structures embody culturally ingrained meanings, physical demands, and financial investments that continue to shape the experiences of those who live behind them. Data was gathered from April 2012 to April 2014 in Venice, the Netherlands, Guyana and the Maldives, and included sixty-two semi-structured interviews and nine focus groups, touching upon the lived experiences of 120 people. Findings illustrate the tensions and contradictions that ground seawall development. In Guyana, sand bags and rip-rap structures line the coast in contrast to the state of the art concrete barriers found in Venice, the Netherlands, and the United States. Poor coastal villages have few options as they invest time and hope in the restoration of mangroves forests, a process that has been met with many obstacles and unexpected sacrifices. In the Maldives, one-third of the population lives on a walled island without beaches, while tourists enjoy holidays on over two hundred island resorts nearby. As seawalls become measures of last resort in the struggle to hold the line, the existing narratives of the ""sinking island"" and ""climate change refugee"" fail to capture the dynamic inequalities that exist within and between places. This study shows the need to offer different conceptualizations of rising seas in public discourses, based on an analysis of seawalls and what the people who live in and around them say as they speak out.",Maldives,73.22068,3.202778,1

The remaining few of these parasites live in sub-Saharan and Sahelian Africa in the countries of Chad, Ethiopia, Mali, and South Sudan. By the end of 2010 there were fewer than 1,800 cases of Guinea worm reported worldwide, an astonishing decrease from the estimated 3.5 million reported cases in 1980 when the international eradication effort began. There is no vaccine or preventative medicine to inoculate against the parasite and the eradication effort has focused on an educational program, teaching those at risk how to prevent infection. Through education and community programs to improve access to clean and safe drinking water, it is hoped that the parasite will have been eliminated from the waters worldwide in the near future. The goal of this research is to understand how Guinea worm has reemerged in regions where it had once been eliminated. A current hurdle to the eradication effort is to supervise the regions where Guinea worm once existed to ensure there is no reemergence. There have been several incidents of reemergence in the past and the work for this dissertation examines historical data on Guinea worm reemergence to better understand the process and identify the most suitable methods for locating regions at risk for reemergence. Results of this analysis show that specific transportation networks and medical facilities may play a role in determining the spread of Guinea worm as it reestablishes itself in a region. This work reiterates that both disease transmission and species abundance are fundamentally spatial processes and that the incorporation of spatial approaches provides new insights into the nature of Guinea worm reemergence.

Religious Studies",Religious Studies,Thomas A. Carlson,"While the practice of asceticism has been widely understood as a world-rejecting phenomenon by philosophers and scholars of religion, recent theorists of asceticism have attempted to refocus on asceticism's affirmative dimensions. I argue that these attempts to explore the affirmative nature of asceticism have lacked full engagement with Friedrich Nietzsche's philosophical reflection upon asceticism's world-negating and world-affirming possibilities. By exploring Nietzsche's critique of and approbation of asceticism, I find resources for identifying two broad trajectories according to which ascetic practices can be organized. In the first, asceticism is explicitly engaged by the practitioner with the purpose of achieving a self-mastery that allows the practitioner to wield power over others, the world, and/or the practitioner's fate. In attempting to wield this control over the world, I argue that the ascetic inherently devalues it. In the second trajectory, the adherent's ascetic exercises are aimed at mastering the self in such a way as to resist the impulse to master the world, thus allowing the practitioner to affirm the world ""as it is."". In making this distinction, I develop a new theory of asceticism by both drawing from and critiquing the theoretical contributions of Max Weber and Michel Foucault, as well as those of more recent theorists including Geoffrey Harpham and Gavin Flood. In revealing the ascetic underpinnings of Nietzsche's philosophy, I demonstrate the ways in which the concerns of this bitter critic of Christianity resonate deeply with certain strains of Christian ascetic and mystical theology. Thus, I explore the ways in which Christian asceticism can aim in a world-affirming direction akin to that which Nietzsche endorses. To this end, I examine asceticism's role in Fyodor Dostoevsky's The Brothers Karamazov and the films of Terrence Malick, and I elucidate how these two artists depict both the world-denying and world-affirming potential of Christian asceticism. In the conclusion, I explore the applicability of my theory to the study of Islamic asceticism, and, by extension, the study of other manifestations of religious and philosophical asceticism.",Mali,-3.996166,17.570692,2

French",French,Eric Prieto,"This work delineates the unique role theatre plays in the establishment of Martinican and Guadeloupian cultural and national identity independent from (although integrated with) the dominant French culture of their former colonizers. As French overseas departments, both Martinique's and Guadeloupe's public school system has been imported from France and thus imposes an alienating French emphasis on West Indian consciousness and identity. Yet theatre offers a new place for cultural education because it can instill pride, consciousness and identity in a localized form particular to Martinique and Guadeloupe. This important educational function is especially notable in the plays analyzed here, which are virtually absent from the critical literature on the French Caribbean, yet clearly merit a closer look. I examine a corpus of over twenty French West Indian plays. I consider these plays as cultural manifestations of what Martinicans and Guadeloupians value and disparage. I look at this theatre also as a national theatre wherein a narrative of the nation is fabricated and affirmed publically. I study Martinicans and Guadeloupians through their theatrical cultural manifestations which themselves focus on historical and contemporary events. Thus my analysis contributes cultural and historical depth to the rapidly evolving field of French Caribbean theatre criticism. My dissertation examines works, 1960-present, by Aime Cesaire, Edouard Glissant, Daniel Boukman, Ina Cesaire, Rene Louise and Patrick Chamoiseau, to name a few. One can discern in these works an independent cultural identity, which can be illuminated by the lens of ""auto-ethnography."" This term refers to Glissant and Chamoiseau's interest in studying and transcribing their own cultures with both the critical eye of an outside observer and the deep understanding of a native informant. Although the other authors did not self-identify as auto-ethnographers, I argue that one can apply this concept more broadly. The early 1960s were a crucial time when many colonies were fighting for and gaining independence. Although not directly engaged in anti-colonial struggles, Martinicans and Gaudeloupians nevertheless participated in independence movements and theatre was a significant arena for articulating these issues. Prior to this moment, imitation and reproduction of French theatre, culture, and society reigned; from the 1960s onward, playwrights focused on the expression and resuscitation of local history and culture. To facilitate this expression, many writers turned toward popular movements such as Negritude, Antillanite, and Creolite, enabling a cultural education and affirming an identity particular to both Martinique and Guadeloupe.",Martinique,-61.024174,14.641528,1

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,John M. Cottle,"The process of subduction has significant influence on the geochemical evolution of the crust and mantle, and subduction-related magmatism may have been an important mechanism for the growth of continental crust over time. Extensive exposure of the mid-crustal levels of an ancient, exhumed continental arc in the Transantarctic Mountains provides an exceptional opportunity to study the metamorphic and magmatic processes associated with an archetypal subduction zone. The belt of multiply deformed metamorphic rocks and granitoid batholiths records convergence and subduction of paleo-Pacific oceanic lithosphere beneath East Antarctica during the Neoproterozoic--Paleozoic Ross orogeny. These rocks are especially well exposed in the southern Victoria Land (sVL) segment of the Transantarctic Mountains----the largest ice-free area of Antarctica. The metamorphic and igneous rocks in sVL provide insights into the early stages of convergent-margin tectonism, the compositional diversity of subduction-related magmatism, and the relative roles of crustal growth and recycling in continental arcs. In Chapter 1 of this dissertation, garnet Lu-Hf and monazite U-Pb geochronology---combined with petrography, mineral chemistry, and thermobarometry---reveal a Barrovian-style metamorphic history that predated the dominant phase of magmatism in sVL. The geochronology data from this study provide one of the oldest records of tectonism along the Ross orogen. The results are consistent with a tectonic model that involves shortening across the margin of East Antarctica prior to the major phase of subduction-related magmatism. Chapter 2 explores the age and magma sources of a large subduction-related igneous complex in the Dry Valleys area. Zircon U-Pb geochronology demonstrates that the period of magmatism in the Dry Valleys was relatively short-lived compared to other segments of the Ross orogen. Whole-rock geochemistry and Hf isotopes in zircon reveal the assimilation of ancient crust during the differentiation of juvenile magmas that were likely derived from an enriched sub-continental lithospheric mantle source. A compilation of Nd and Sr isotope data from granitoids from along the Ross orogen suggest that enriched lithospheric mantle may have been a common juvenile magma source along the arc. In Chapter 3, a comprehensive geochemical, geochronologic, and isotopic investigation of the magmatism in sVL explores the conspicuous occurrence of alkaline silicate rocks and carbonatites---most commonly associated with intraplate and continental-rift magmatism---within the continental arc. The alkaline magmatism was partially contemporaneous with the emplacement of large sub-alkaline igneous complexes in adjacent segments of the arc. The isotopic and trace element composition of the alkaline and subalkaline rocks suggests derivation from geochemically enriched sources---potentially metasomatized sub-continental lithospheric mantle. Despite enriched isotopic and trace element compositions that broadly resemble recycled continental crust, binary mixing and assimilation-fractional crystallization models indicate that crustal growth may have been dominant over crustal reworking in the sVL magmatism.",Martis Valley Groundwater Basin ,-120.1176964,39.3290736,1

Counseling, Clinical and School Psychology","Counseling, Clinical and School Psychology",Michael J. Furlong,"Reducing student problem behavior remains a leading concern for school officials, as disruptive and aggressive behavior interferes with student achievement, as well as the overall climate of the school. However, the systemic and often complicated nature of schools makes it difficult for researchers and practitioners to identify contributing factors to students' behavior. The current study builds upon school effectiveness literature and examines student problem behavior through a transactional-ecological lens by taking into account individual (e.g., gender, ethnicity, prosocial behavior), classroom (e.g., teacher characteristics, class size, behavioral norms), and school-level factors (e.g., location, SES, school climate). Using data from 37 Maryland schools, 467 classrooms, and 8,750 elementary school-aged students, a series of seven hierarchical linear models (HLM) were tested. HLM analyses revealed that while individual student characteristics had the largest influence on problem behavior, teacher perceptions of the school climate and the behavioral norms of the classroom significantly related to how students behaved. These findings support the use of climate-enhancing intervention programs implemented both school-wide and in the classroom as a means of reducing student problem behavior.",Maryland,-76.6412712,39.0457549,2

This project considers the crisis of legitimacy for police at the street level. Data come in the form of third party videos collected by a local resident of the Fillmore, a poor black neighborhood subject to aggressive policing located in San Francisco, CA. Videos capture police-citizen interactions and analysis focused on bystander participation during the street encounter. Videos were analyzed using methods of analytic induction and visual coding schemes. Findings show that bystanders use taunting and insulting the police as a form of resistance. Additionally, bystanders give advice to the subject of the encounter. Furthermore, bystander comments reveal the ways they believe gender and race to be relevant to the police-citizen encounter and relationship with law enforcement more generally. Bystander talk reframes the encounter and positions the subject as victim and law enforcement as the source of trouble. Bystanders accuse the police of going beyond the parameters of their jobs to express sexual desire and racial antipathy. Additionally, bystander participation dramatizes the limits of police authority as bystanders offer the subject legal advice and creates derogatory experiences for the police.",Maryland,-76.6412712,39.0457549,2

Feminist Studies",Feminist Studies,Leila J. Rupp,"Drawing on the tensions between biological determinism and social constructionism from my prior scholarship, this dissertation also shows that exposure to queer-normative erotic worlds fosters a willingness to question norms around sexuality and gender, which promotes a vision of what a utopian queer future could look like. The introduction to an educational environment where same-sex sexuality is not only normalized but embraced by the prevailing student culture creates a community where heterosexuality is not presumed as the default. Such a powerful sense of possibility and freedom rewrites the traditional coming-out narrative premised in failed attempts at heterosexuality and a discovery of one's ""true self"" and begs the question of what wider society would look like if more individuals were asked to challenge their assumptions about their own sexual and gender identities. Using snowball sampling, I interviewed fifty-six LGBTQ students and recent alumnae/i at Mount Holyoke College and Smith College - 32 at Mount Holyoke and 24 at Smith - and asked a range of open-ended questions drawing on the themes of sexual and gender identity, belonging to and disidentification with campus community, characteristics and definitions of queer community, and overall views on gender and sexuality. Performing a qualitative discourse analysis that builds on the theories of a diverse set of gender, sexuality, and critical race scholars, I argue that while the women's colleges studied act as empowering and transformational erotic worlds for sexual and gender exploration, queer hierarchies found in both institutions' student cultures promote gender-, race-, and class-based stratification. These hierarchies elevate white, typically class-privileged masculinity as most desirable while alienating queer students of color and low-income queer students through the maintenance of white-dominated, class-privileged space, sidelining and erasing queer femme students, and rendering transgender-spectrum students simultaneously invisible and hypervisible. This dissertation on the queer cultures found at two New England women's colleges, Mount Holyoke College and Smith College in western Massachusetts, engages in key debates over the value placed on community, identity, and visibility, demonstrating that all three concepts remain powerful and crucial organizing rubrics for many LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer) people. At the same time that the queer student cultures at these institutions are regarded by many current students and recent alumnae/i as celebratory havens for sexual and gender diversity, however, they are also implicated in intracommunal stratification and hierarchy, which I critically analyze using Adam Isaiah Green's sexual fields theory and Michel Foucault's theories on biopower and docile bodies. I consider the fundamental tensions that exist in spaces considered simultaneously utopic and oppressive, expanding in the conclusion on what these spaces can tell queer studies scholars about notions of queer futurity and utopia as theorized by Jose Esteban Munoz.",Massachusetts,-71.3824374,42.4072107,2

Sociology",Sociology,France Winddance Twine,"White women on welfare have largely been absent from both the public discourse on welfare and sociological research on racism, poverty, inequality and mobility. This dissertation contributes to these areas of inquiry by providing an empirical study of the operation and reproduction of racial privilege among impoverished women living in the hypersegregated communities of Greater Boston, Massachusetts. In particular, my research examines the role white welfare recipient's play in the construction and reproduction of racism, white privilege and white racial identities. This study is guided by the following questions: 1) How do white women on welfare conceptualize racial identity within the US context of a historically racialized welfare state? How do they manage this racialized institution? 2) How do women on welfare cope with social stigma in their public and private lives? How does race impact how women on welfare negotiate social stigma? What types of boundary work do women on welfare create, maintain and reproduce? 3) Do white women use whiteness as a resource? How do they deploy whiteness as a resource? In what particular contexts can white women on welfare use whiteness as a resource? Drawing from eight-five in-depth qualitative interviews with women who receive Transitional Assistance for Families with Dependent Children (TAFDC) and ethnographic observations of Department of Transitional Assistance (DTA) offices in Greater Boston I argue that welfare legislation and policy reflects the dominant gendered, racist and classist discourses of our society and structures the identity and lived experience of welfare recipients in profoundly racialized ways. In particular, racial privilege shapes white women on welfare's access to a range of public and private benefits and resources. My research finds that white women on welfare conceptualize their whiteness within larger discourses of hegemonic whiteness and within the context of a racialized welfare system. I empirically demonstrate that whiteness can be deployed as a form of embodied capital that offers welfare recipients with section eight housing vouchers access to greater housing opportunities, and as a result numerous social, economic and symbolic resources for their families. Furthermore, white women on welfare are able to utilize social stigma management strategies, such as passing, that often facilitate the social and economic mobility of their families.",Massachusetts,-71.3824374,42.4072107,2

These organic paints are often present as part of complex mixtures within thin layers, well below the spatial resolution of many instruments. We also report the first high resolution spectroscopy of chromophores within madder dye, an historically significant organic colorant, allowing for the unambiguous identification of the molecule within the intrinsically complex nature of ancient paintings. Additionally, pottery sherds from Maya vessels (600-900 CE) and Mississippian vessels (1100-1200 CE) were examined for three molecular markers (theobromine, theophylline and caffeine) using R2PI spectroscopic techniques. The data obtained supports the existence of a previously unknown trade network between Mesoamerican and North American civilizations. A system combining laser desorption, jet-cooling, resonant 2-photon ionization (R2PI) spectroscopy, and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) generates exceptionally well resolved vibronic spectroscopy and fragment free mass spectrometry for molecules within a complex matrix. Following laser desorption, gas-phase molecules are entrained in a supersonic molecular beam of argon. This causes extremely efficient jet-cooling of the internal degrees of freedom within the molecules and makes it possible to perform high resolution spectroscopy. The cold molecule is resonantly excited to the first electronic excited state by a tunable dye laser, and subsequently ionized by another photon before being detected in the TOF-MS. The result is the ability to selectively ionize a single target molecule within an extremely complex matrix.",May,-82.1247835,39.4042837,1

Biomolecular Science and Engineering",Biomolecular Science and Engineering,Kenneth S. Kosik,"Understanding how genetic variation (genotype) contributes to diverse traits (phenotype) is a grand challenge in biology and the overarching theme of this dissertation. Neurological disorders include over 600 diseases and affect the central and peripheral nervous systems. Communication, intelligence, memory, and consciousness -- fundamental abilities that have elevated humankind above the rest of the animal kingdom, are all susceptible to attack from neurological disorders. The contribution of genetic variation to human traits and diseases has been studied for over a century, revealing a strong genetic component to almost every phenotype examined. Establishing genetic associations and delineating their molecular mechanisms in neurological disorders can reveal insight into the establishment, restoration, and enhancement of key human traits. The commencement of my doctoral studies coincided with the emergence of two groundbreaking scientific achievements: whole-genome sequencing and induced pluripotent stem cells. Here, I used these seminal technological advancements in biology as novel approaches to establish phenotype-genotype connections in neurological disorders. Functional genomics aims to integrate high throughput genomic and transcriptomic data to understand the biological function of genetic variation. This dissertation is split into two parts presenting divergent functional genomics approaches to understand two neurological disorders: whole-genome sequencing in Alzheimer's disease and induced pluripotent stem cell modeling of Williams syndrome. In the first part of this thesis, I used whole-genome sequencing data to identify genetic variants modifying age at onset of Alzheimer's disease in the world's largest family affected with this disease. This family, living in Antioquia, the mountainous region surrounding the major Colombian city Medellin, suffers from a rare form of Alzheimer's caused by a single mutation. This mutation, originating spontaneously in a single Spanish Conquistador, crossed the Atlantic and permeated throughout the pueblos indigenas living in Colombia. Over generations of geographic and genetic isolation coupled with exponential population growth, this single mutation spread to thousands of individuals, all who will develop a form of Alzheimer's at an average age of just 49 years. By sequencing the entire genomes of individuals affected with this disease at a range of different ages, we sought to identify genetic variants controlling the onset of this disease. First, we established a pipeline to sift through the wealth of information in a single genome. Next, we examined the genomic locus spanning the causal mutation to show definitively that the mutation originated in a Spanish settler in the early 16th century. Finally, we found a set of genetic variants in a cluster of chemokines that modifies the onset of Alzheimer's in this family and possibly in the general Alzheimer's population as well. In the second part of this thesis, I used induced pluripotent stem cells from individuals with Williams syndrome (WS) to identify disease-relevant pathways, a first step in connecting gene deletions to complex neurological traits. Arising from a hemizygous microdeletion of ~30 genes on chromosome 7, WS offers one of the best platforms to dissect the contributions of specific genes to neurocognitive phenotypes. Among various symptoms of the syndrome including specific craniofacial abnormalities and a characteristic heart valve defect, hyper-social behavior and enhanced language despite intellectual impairment are unique to WS. Converting induced pluripotent stem cells to neurons effectively allows us to study the brains of these individuals and identify which of the deleted genes may contribute to the neurological hallmarks. Integrating high-throughput transcriptional profiling with chromatin-immunoprecipitation of a gene deleted in WS, we identify a critical developmental node dysregulated in WS and the WS-deleted gene contributing to this defect.",Medellin,-75.5812119,6.244203,1

Drawing on fifteen months of participant observation, interviews and archival research, this person-centered ethnography examines some of the Plan's socio-economic impacts on the livelihoods of a small-scale sugarcane producer, Jesus, from the 1960s when the Plan started to be implemented in the region until today. Though his personal experiences are not identical with other members of his community or residents in other regions, his story offers a valuable reference to a larger ""shared reality"". His experiences are a lens through which to understand the evolution of the Plan, the community, and the environment, from the subsistence farming that characterized the area before the Plan to the sugarcane production that dominates the region today. A political and economic historical perspective is critical in this research as both the town and the Plan have been changing and adapting through time. As a result, the analyses of historical socioeconomic transformations in the Chontalpa shows us the Plan's role as the vehicle of the economic and political integration of the region into the national and international market economy. Consequently, this dissertation argues that local production systems go through transitions that, in many cases, increase economic marginalization, social vulnerability and overexploitation of natural resources on which the local population depend, as a response to these integrations. Despite well-intentioned economic development policies---designed in a framework of moral-economic assumptions different from those of the targeted communities--these initiatives are leading in many cases towards dependency, undermining of local social and economic practices, and negatively impacting the natural environment. Development strategies like Plan Chontalpa continue being implemented despite the shift of the development discourse in recent decades to focus on ""women-centered"" initiatives and environmental sustainability.

Anthropology",Anthropology,Juan Vicente Palerm,"Despite predictions they would disappear, peasants have been resilient. I argue that this resilience warrants renewed anthropological attention. In 2009, I conducted participant-observation research in a peasant community, San Pablo Coatlan, Oaxaca, Mexico. During my fieldwork the community was torn between a powerful minority who sought to bring ""modernization"" by reorganizing the political structure and privatizing the land and the majority who supported the traditional political structure and communal land. This political conflict provided an excellent opportunity to understand the resilience of the peasantry. I define peasants as those who have the ability to practice subsistence farming, but do not have the ability to accumulate wealth. I argue that the resilience of the peasantry is largely a result of two factors: liminal livelihoods, and social capital. First, peasant livelihoods are liminal: they are at the edge of subsistence production, market production, and wage labor. Peasants are not an intermediate stage between ""primitive"" and ""modern"", their livelihoods are active strategies to combine available opportunities. Peasants' ability to practice subsistence farming provides a productive use for household labor. This ability is important even for those who are dedicated entirely to wage labor because the ability to return to subsistence farming is a form of insurance. The second factor which contributes to the resilience of the peasantry is social capital. Peasants can rely on the support of their fellow community members. In San Pablo, people use unpaid cooperative labor for farming and home construction. I show that much of the farming would not be possible if farmers had to hire workers when they needed additional hands. I explore the various motives to collaborate in private production and in public life. I argue that there are several instrumental motives to participate: direct rewards, reciprocity, and prestige. There are also several consummatory motives: enjoyment, value introjection, and bounded solidarity. I organize these motives into a framework to understand participation that connects the motives to material, structural, and ideological factors within the community. In the conclusion, I argue that this framework has applicability beyond peasant communities to better understand the motives to contribute to the common good.",Mexico,-102.552784,23.634501,64

In particular, it analyzes the Chupacabras as a subversive image, used to unify and address the struggles of small farmers and create a sophisticated polysemic metaphor to illustrate the insatiable appetite and predatory practices of neo-liberalism as implemented by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) during the 1990s. The third chapter continues with the study of Juan Soldado (1930s), one of the saints of undocumented border crossers, within the context of the border transformations created by American Prohibition (1920-1933), the Great Depression (1930s), and the mass ""deportation"" of Mexican-Americans and Mexican nationals (1929-1939). This research situates Juan Soldado's conviction for the rape and murder of an eight years old girl, and the subsequent Tijuana riots surrounding this case, as a pivotal event in the long tradition of femicides along the border. I analyze (a) the myth of the Devil along the border, (b) the Chupacabras, the livestock blood-sucking monster; and (c) the legend of Juan Soldado, a saint of undocumented border crossers. These three entities are used in order to create a genealogy of the effects of capitalism in the region, as each of them correlates to crucial periods of U.S.-Mexico relations. The first chapter begins by studying the legend of El Diablo (the Devil) along the U.S.-Mexico Border, in particular as it is narrated in the novel The Devil in Texas/El Diablo en Texas (1976) by Aristeo Brito. It explores the devil within the context of exploitative capitalism in the region and highlights the interconnection between the events of the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), the effects of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo (1848), and the emergence of the modern Chicana/o Movement (1960-1970s). My dissertation examines the U.S.-Mexico border during the 20th century, not only as a socio-political space of conflict and struggle, but simultaneously as a 2,000-mile strip of ""haunted"" land, inhabited by many imaginary creatures, fantastic tales, monsters, and popular saints. It is through an examination of government proceedings, archival documents, religious artifacts, interviews, and ethnographic visits to border shrines and festival celebrations, that this research engages with the question of how communities utilize the fantastic and the uncanny to disseminate knowledge and inscribe history.",Mexico,-102.552784,23.634501,64

The purpose of this study is to investigate how listening to music, through its affective (both specific sentiments and a general sense of what a space or time feels like) and sonic energies, generates modes of thinking and feeling that shape identity, community and resilience. While Latino music cultures have long been celebrated listening and listening practices as a form of knowing, being and surviving is understudied. I focus on three groups of listeners that, I argue, represent Latino listening cultures--- a culturally specific set of shared attitudes, values and practices around listening to particular music. The listening cultures analyzed included Mexican custodians who listen to the radio at work, Chicana/o Morrissey fans, and undergraduate Latina/o iPod users. Methodologically, my research is grounded in ethnographic methods of participant-observation, interviews, surveys, and material collection. A total of 40 semi-structured interviews were carried out with Chicano/Latino music lovers and 275 students responded to a web survey. A grounded theory approach was used to code all data. Additionally, I recorded field observations at concerts, work spaces, and campus common areas. Findings suggest that practices, associations and feelings generated through listening to music are a significant site for critical awareness of ethnic and gender identity, racialization, and community. Ultimately, I argue listening may generate resilient forms of listening and living. One major finding from the Chicana/o listening culture built around Morrissey was that at an individual level, Morrissey provides a venue for fans to explore emotional losses and vulnerabilities, as well as, nontraditional gender roles and identities. At the collective level, listeners discussed finding solace over feeling excluded from the wider society because of racial and cultural differences. The Mexican custodians found, in Spanish-language radio, a late-night companion for their solitary job, an affirming connection to Mexico and a way to literally claim space through music. A survey of 275 undergraduate Latinos revealed that listening to music on digital music players functioned as a sonic refuge for coping with stress, a minoritized status on campus, as well as a portable sonic archive of ethnic identity.",Mexico,-102.552784,23.634501,64

Chicana and Chicano Studies",Chicana and Chicano Studies,"Miroslava Chavez-Garcia, Dolores I. Casillas","My research examines early twentieth-century immigration policies focusing on the experience of ""repatriation"" that tore apart Mexican and Mexican American families throughout the United States. It considers this historical moment as the ""banishment"" of U.S. citizens of Mexican descent to foreground the difference between repatriation, which implies that the person is not a citizen of a given country and banishment, referring to citizens who are banned from their home country. This discursive difference challenges much of the literature that refers to these banishments as ""repatriations"", obscuring the systematic racist and exclusionist immigration policies. The legal, social, and cultural ramifications of banishment on second and third generation descendants of U.S. citizens are largely absent in Chicana/o-Latina/o historiographies and immigration legal studies. My work takes an innovative approach in that it focuses on the prolonged consequences of immigration policies on surviving banished U.S. citizens and their descendants and the link to today's growing legally mixed-status households across the United States. My study demonstrates that U.S. immigration policies continue to ignore the long and complex Mexico-U.S. immigration relations, failing to create adequate paths to legalization for old and new generations of Mexican immigrants. This study centers on the experiences of banishment of three extended families and uses their oral histories across multiple generations to recover and rewrite the history of forced exclusion. The families are composed of surviving U.S. citizens who were banished during the early twentieth century and/or who are descendants of those survivors who have returned to the United States, some as undocumented immigrants. The participating families include the Yanez family, residing in Anaheim, California; the Molina family, spread throughout California, Alabama, and Mexico; and the Robles family, living in Pasadena, California. To allow for personal accounts as well as communal- or family-based interpretations, each family member is interviewed individually and then the entire family is interviewed collectively, providing for a multiplicity of insights and richly texture points of views. In addition to oral histories, this study mines the families' archives, which are composed of photographs, letters, and legal records detailing the experiences of banishment over the course of the twentieth century. Institutional records, including legal histories, archival materials, and demographic data housed at the National Archives in Washington D.C. and the regional branches in Los Angeles, California, as well as El Paso, Texas are used to contextualize the primary research and to reconstruct and reinterpret the immigration policies of the time. My study indicates that these families experienced repatriation in very unique ways, but with a common sense of contempt that extends across family generations, and continue to face real legal and social collateral consequences. My findings demonstrate that an almost 90-year-old unofficial, later becoming official, policy continues to classify direct descendents of banished U.S. citizens as ""illegal"" immigrants in their parents and grandparents' home country. Banishment has resulted in what I term, a transgenerational illegality, which has been nearly impossible to shake. These findings are crucial at a time where immigration remains central to national debates. The twenty original oral histories collected for this study demonstrate that, despite the subjugation of these families, the descendants found ways to challenge their ""illegal"" status, giving rise to the concept of a contested illegality..",Mexico,-102.552784,23.634501,64

As an assortment of medial forms, The U.S.-Mexico border does not refer to the United States and Mexico as the subjects of its mediation, but rather produces the United States and Mexico as subjects, which thereon depend on the border for their subjectivity, as the border depends on the nations for its continued existence. The United States and Mexico cannot be articulated from or with one another without what media theorist Bernhard Siegert calls ""concrete practices and symbolic operations"" to process their articulation, operations which are ultimately expressed in medial forms, whether lines on maps, untranslatable proper nouns, legal writ, poetic verses, or fences. In drawing connections between the borders produced in different media, I am examining borders as media systems that correspond to different cultural techniques and produce distinct political subjectivities. To envision this network, I develop the concept of the hyperborder, which I define as a border that extends across media. The hyperborder is a framework that links together different mediated borders, and that proposes and examines epistemological connections between them. The hyperborder is a way of attaining a global and comparative view of borders, while at the same time accounting for their different and irreducible media forms. In this project, I examine border forms primarily in three media: literary media, including poetry and prose; cartographic media, with an attention to different cultural meanings of mapmaking; and infrastructural media, particularly types of fencing. My methodology for researching and comparing these different media forms combines archival and participatory research. In order to study textual borders---those found in literary and cartographic media---I have relied on archival research carried out at UC Berkeley's Bancroft Library and in the Special Collections of UCSB's Davidson Library. My desire to account for the location of media has also compelled me to research media forms in the field, so to speak.

Finally, the third chapter estimates a compensating differential for fatality risk for workers in Mexico. An abstract for each chapter is provided below. Chapter 1 Abstract: Identifying a causal effect of labor market opportunities on criminal behavior is difficult given (a) an endogenous relationship between labor markets and crime and (b) the challenge of using aggregate measures to capture employment opportunities for individuals on the margin of criminal activity. The institutional structure of the California criminal justice system as well as location-, skill-, and industry-specific employment measures provide a unique framework to identify a causal effect. I find that a one-standard-deviation increase in the prevalence of relevant employment opportunities is associated with a 1 to 2 percent decrease in the probability released offenders return to prison. Chapter 2 Abstract: We study the behavior of a cluster-robust t statistic and make two principle contributions. First, we relax the restriction of previous asymptotic theory that clusters have identical size, and establish that the cluster-robust t statistic continues to have a Gaussian asymptotic null distribution. Second, we determine how variation in cluster sizes, together with other sources of cluster heterogeneity, affect the behavior of the test statistic. To do so, we determine the sample specific measure of cluster heterogeneity that governs this behavior and show that the measure depends on how three quantities vary over clusters: cluster size, the cluster specific error covariance matrix and the actual value of the covariates. Because, in the absence of a fixed design, the third quantity will always vary over clusters, the vast majority of empirical analyses have test statistics whose finite sample behavior is impacted by cluster heterogeneity. To capture this impact, we develop the effective number of clusters, which scales down the actual number of clusters by the measure of cluster heterogeneity. Through simulation we demonstrate this effect and find rejection rates as high as 30 percent for a nominal size of 5 percent. We then apply our measure of cluster heterogeneity in several empirical settings to show how observable variation over clusters impacts the performance of a cluster-robust test. Chapter 3 Abstract: The escalation in violence in recent years resulting from the Mexican government's war on drug trafficking has caused a large and unprecedented increase in workplace fatality risk for workers in Mexico. We exploit this increase to estimate a compensating differential for fatality risk using panel data constructed from a national employment and occupation survey.

Our results imply a VSL between $160,000 and $350,000 U.S dollars for a nationally representative sample of Mexican workers.

Chapter 1 Abstract: In spite of the generally accepted status of English as a lingua franca, the labor market returns to English for its role as an international language are understudied. In this paper I use advertisements from Computrabajo.com.mx to estimate the returns to English in Mexico. I find that the wage premium for English speakers is approximately 28 percent for the sample as a whole. The evidence suggests that English may provide a path to upward economic mobility in Mexico, and that this holds true for persons of all skill levels. Chapter 2 Abstract: When permitted by law and custom, employers sometimes engage in ex ante screening of job candidates using demographic criteria like age and gender. We study this practice using four samples of job ads, taken from job boards in China and Mexico. Consistent with Kuhn and Shen's (2013) screening cost model, we find a strong, negative skill-targeting relationship in all four data sets: employers are less likely to express an explicit age or gender preference in a job ad as the job's skill requirements rise. We also find that employers' age and gender preferences interact in a strong and consistent way across all four data sets: relative to women, men's (revealed) desirability as workers rises dramatically between the ages of 18 and 40. While some of this pattern can be linked to an age-dependent demand for feminine beauty and to gender differences in firms' marital status preferences, other aspects of the pattern are harder to explain.

I find that the wage premium for English speakers is approximately 28 percent for the sample as a whole. The evidence suggests that English may provide a path to upward economic mobility in Mexico, and that this holds true for persons of all skill levels. Chapter 2 Abstract: When permitted by law and custom, employers sometimes engage in ex ante screening of job candidates using demographic criteria like age and gender. We study this practice using four samples of job ads, taken from job boards in China and Mexico. Consistent with Kuhn and Shen's (2013) screening cost model, we find a strong, negative skill-targeting relationship in all four data sets: employers are less likely to express an explicit age or gender preference in a job ad as the job's skill requirements rise. We also find that employers' age and gender preferences interact in a strong and consistent way across all four data sets: relative to women, men's (revealed) desirability as workers rises dramatically between the ages of 18 and 40. While some of this pattern can be linked to an age-dependent demand for feminine beauty and to gender differences in firms' marital status preferences, other aspects of the pattern are harder to explain. Chapter 3 Abstract: The escalation in violence in recent years resulting from the Mexican government's war on drug trafficking has caused a large and unprecedented increase in workplace fatality risk for workers in Mexico. We exploit this increase to estimate a compensating differential for fatality risk using panel data constructed from a national employment and occupation survey. We also provide estimates of the value of a statistical life (VSL) in Mexico. Our results imply a VSL between $160,000 and $350,000 U.S dollars for a nationally representative sample of Mexican workers. This is well below the range of estimates typically found in developed countries, which is consistent with the notion that health and safety are normal goods.",Mexico,-102.552784,23.634501,64

English",English,Shirley G. Lim,"Unsettling Solidarities examines Asian North American and Indigenous solidarities, alliances, and interactions imagined in the contemporary literatures of these two communities, tracing how these moments of literary contact reveal the vexed dynamics of race and resistance after the mid-twentieth century. Emerging out of anti-colonial and anti-racist movements of the 1950-70s, narratives by Maxine Hong Kingston, Joy Kogawa, Karen Tei Yamashita, and Leslie Marmon Silko grapple with the limits of identity-based cultural politics, articulating in its their place different collectivities and ethical relations that can account for the increasing stratifications of power within and across racial identities. The dissertation tracks the aesthetically diverse ways these writers imagine their own and each other's communities within their revised cultural politics, and argues that the ambivalent depictions register these communities' differential yet mutually constitutive histories and critical visions for social justice. Recent scholarship in Critical Race and Ethnic Studies has posited a comparative framework---within and between communities of difference---for apprehending the shifting localities, agents, and processes of settler colonial distributions of life and (vulnerabilities to) death. Such analytics have become urgent within the context of (neo)liberal multiculturalism and its selective recognition of cultural difference as the condition of possibility for new global economic restructuring for inequities. Asian/Indigenous convergences, in particular, bring to the fore how civil rights frameworks can elide Indigenous experiences, perpetuating discursive erasures of settler colonial conditions. The dissertation's project foregrounds these tensions, attending to their biopolitical and affective dimensions, as they are revealed, negotiated, and metonymically reproduced within the narratives. By investigating the intersecting affective economies of Asian/Indigenous interaction, imagined at various geopolitical sites (such as Hawai`i, the U.S./Mexico Border, Canada, and Brazil), this study connects intimate and localized specificities of racial formations to broader networks of settler national configurations.",Mexico,-102.552784,23.634501,64

Environmental Science and Management",Environmental Science and Management,Frank Davis,"Residential development is now a major contributor to land surface change in the U.S. From 1990 - 2000, over thirteen million housing units were added to the nation's housing stock which stood at 102.3 million in 1990. Another 15.8 million housing units were added from 2000 - 2010. Of particular concern is the ongoing increase in low-density residential development because of its large resource footprint and biodiversity impacts. In this dissertation I pose three broad questions 1) What were the trends in residential development in the U.S. from 1990 - 2000? 2) What were the trends in rural conversion to low-density residential use from 1990 - 2000 in the Mid-Atlantic and the Pacific Northwest and what social and environmental factors help explain these trends? 3) What were the effects of rural conversion to residential use on vegetation productivity in the Mid-Atlantic and the Pacific Northwest from 2000 - 2010? To answer these questions I created a database derived from U.S. Census blocks that allows for interdecadal comparison of recent housing density change in support of spatial demographic research. In a series of GIS based analyses I used the database to map changes in metropolitan housing density distributions in the Mid-Atlantic and western Washington regions and used a satellite derived index of vegetation productivity to assess the impacts of housing growth on vegetation carbon uptake. Results indicate that residential housing growth is more dynamic than previously thought and established approaches for mapping housing density tend to underestimate the local intensity of residential change. In the Mid-Atlantic and western Washington, low-density residential development is affecting large fractions of rural landscapes in metropolitan areas. The strongest correlates of low-density conversion of rural landscapes were population growth and extent of protected lands, suggesting future directions for modeling the drivers of rural conversion. Residential development in the rural landscapes of the Mid-Atlantic and western Washington reduced mean and maximum vegetation productivity from 2000 - 2010. The influence of residential development on maximum productivity was particularly evident in Mid-Atlantic deciduous forests. As a whole the findings reveal continued metropolitan decentralization which is associated with reductions of vegetation productivity in forest ecosystems of the Mid-Atlantic and western Washington.",Mexico,-102.552784,23.634501,64

The case of maize in Mexico is interesting because its production is of capital importance to the country's culture and economy, being also the staple crop for most subsistence farmers. Maize crops account for 40% of the country's arable land, and 65% of the total maize production happens under rainfed regime. This dissertation addresses, via three independent studies, the uncertainties associated with current climate variability and change in Mexico and the impacts on rainfed maize production. In Chapter 1 I defined a set of climate parameters relevant for maize production, evaluated their trends over six decades, and investigated the potential influence of large-scale climate teleconnection patterns. In Chapter 2 I assessed the impact of climate variability on state-level maize yield anomalies. Three decades of seasonal observations were used to fit multiple regression models, in which geographical differences of agro-climate conditions selectively defined the set of predictors for each state. Finally, in Chapter 3 I propose a new statistical framework to assess the impacts of climate stressors on maize crops. Using municipalities as spatial units and observations over four growing seasons, the occurrence of crop failure was modeled as a function of climate stressors specific to each stage of the growing period. In brief, significant portions of Mexico experience trends towards climate conditions potentially hazardous for maize growth, such as increasing dryness, delayed rainy seasons, more extreme precipitation and heat stress events. However, predictability could be improved by further understanding of the driving roles played by both the Atlantic and Pacific oceans on Mexico's climate. The state-level regression models show that climate variability affects maize yields differently across the country, and the varying sensitivity could be associated not only to region-specific climates but also to the heterogeneity of production scales, adaptation practices, and reliability of yield reports.

Hourly total hydrocarbon (THC) data, spanning 1990 to 2008 from an air pollution station located near COP, were analyzed and showed geologic CH4 emissions as the dominant local source. A band ratio approach was developed and applied to high glint AVIRIS data over COP, resulting in local-scale mapping of natural atmospheric CH4 plumes.

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Alexander R. Simms,"Recent studies along the northwestern Gulf of Mexico document rapid back-stepping of estuarine environments of up to 20 km and 150 m/yr at ca. 8.2 thousand years ago (ka), 4.8, ka, and 2.6 ka. If such rapid changes in coastal environments occurred today along the urbanized coast of the Gulf of Mexico major economical and ecological loss would occur. Of these three backstepping events, only one can be tied to a known cause---the 8.2 ka event related to a rapid increase in the rate of relative sea-level rise. However, the cause of the latter two, the 4.8 and 2.6 ka events are largely unknown. To determine the relative roles of changes in sea level and climate in these two events, paleo sea-level (Chapter 2), climate (Chapter 3), and stratigraphic records (Chapter 4) are presented from upper Baffin Bay, Texas and neighboring playa Laguna Salada. As commonly used high-resolution sea-level indicators are absent from the southern Texas Coast, a new sea-level indicator is needed. I test the use of intertidal microbial mats in reconstructing Holocene sea levels from Baffin, Bay Texas (Chapter 2). The indicative range of microbial mats is +/-0.29 m, much less than the +/-2 m indicative range of typical sea-level indicators currently used along the semiarid Texas coast. The elevations of 22 buried radiocarbon-dated microbial mats plot within error of relative sea-level data derived from the central Texas coast for the past 5.0 ky indicating that microbial mats provide a robust proxy for paleo--sea levels along semiarid and arid coastlines. The high-resolution microbial mat relative sea-level record derived from the tectonically stable central Texas coast also provides a test of recently proposed Holocene Highstands based on emergent coastal deposits in Texas and Alabama. The microbial mat relative sea-level data, similar to relative sea-level data derived from Mississippi Delta basal peats and lower-resolution Texas estuarine bivalves, indicates an ever-decreasing rate of relative sea-level rise since ca. 5.0 ka and precludes the possibility of Holocene Highstands in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Paleoclimate records are also sparse along the southern Texas coast. A new quantitative drought proxy is derived from a transfer function between X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) elemental data from a Texas playa and a tree-ring drought record (Chapter 3). Using this transfer function, a 954-year tree-ring drought record was extended to ca. 3,000 ka. Ba, Br, and Pb were utilized as predictor variables. Machine learning algorithms, utilized to derive the transfer function, had maximum validation accuracies of 94%. Changes in the extended drought record correspond with the timing of the Roman Climate Optimum, Medieval Warm Period, Little Ice Age, and changes in North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SST). Increased drought frequency is coeval with nearby dune migration ca. 0.2 ka, 1.9 ka, and 2.6 ka. The highest drought frequency in the record occurs during the Medieval Warm Period ca. 1.0 ka followed by a decrease in drought frequency during the Little Ice Age ca. 0.4 ka. Increased drought frequency accompanies increased North Atlantic SST since 3 ka. This trend of warm North Atlantic SST and dry conditions over the study area follows secular meteorological observations and tree-ring records. These results indicate that lacustrine derived XRF element data can be used as a quantitative tool to reconstruct past drought records, and that North Atlantic SST modulated drought in southern Texas for the last 3,000 years. Within Baffin Bay, five flooding surfaces making periods of abrupt environmental change, between 1.1--1.0 ka, 2.7--2.1 ka, 3.8--3.0 ka, 5.2--4.9 ka, and 6.5--5.7 ka occur through a time-period of ever decreasing rates of relative sea-level rise and within error of periods of drying in southern Texas at ca. 1.0 ka, 2.6 ka, 3.4 ka, 4.8 ka, and 5.5 ka (Chapter 4). I hypothesize that these flooding surfaces, occurring when sea level in the Gulf of Mexico was rising < 2 mm/yr, and during independently documented drying events, were primarily driven by changes in climate through declines in fluvial sediment supply to the coast.",Mexico,-102.552784,23.634501,64

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Alexander R. Simms,"The economic importance of coastlines highlights the need to understand how coasts evolve in response to changing climate. Prior work suggests that many of the estuaries in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico underwent large changes at 2.6, 4.8, and 8.2 ka. Twenty-eight vibracores, eight Geoprobe cores, twenty-eight radiocarbon ages, and twenty-five kilometers of seismic profiles were used to determine the response of the Nueces Bay-head Delta to the 2.6 ka and 4.8 ka events. Within the cores we identified nine sedimentary facies representing five distinct deltaic environments. Within the 25 kilometers of seismic data, we identified five seismic facies that correspond to the deltaic environments identified within the sediment cores. Fifteen sand lobes interpreted to be buried mouth-bar deposits identified in the seismic profiles and cores were used to track changes in the location of the seaward edge of the delta through the middle to late Holocene. Following progradation of the delta at 7.5 ka, the delta underwent two backstepping events in which the delta front transgressed up to 20 km at 4.8 ka and 2.6 ka. Following these two backstepping events the delta prograded up to 20 km seaward of the deltas maximum landward location. During delta progradation from 4.8-3.2 ka delivering 8.3x103 m3/yr of sand was delivered to the delta. During delta backstepping from 3.2-2.6 ka 6.5x103 m3/yr of sand was delivered to the delta. During the last phase of delta progradation from 2.6 ka-present delivering 6.6x103 m3/yr of sand was delivered to the delta.

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Phillip Gans,"Three informal formations are identified in the study area: (1) the ca. 27.5 Ma Parajes formation, a ~1-km-thick succession of primarily welded silicic outflow ignimbrite sheets erupted from sources within ~50--100 km of the study area that were active during the Early Oligocene pulse of the mid-Cenozoic ignimbrite flare-up; (2) the ca. 27--24.5 Ma Temoris formation, composed primarily of locally erupted mafic-intermediate lavas and associated intrusions with interbedded alluvial deposits, likely related to rocks of the Southern Cordillera basaltic andesite province that were intermittently erupted across all of the northern Sierra Madre Occidental following the Early Oligocene ignimbrite pulse; and (3) the ca. 24.5--23 Ma Sierra Guazapares formation, composed of silicic vent to proximal facies ignimbrites, lavas, plugs, and reworked equivalents that record the initiation of explosive and effusive silicic fissure magmatism in the study area during the Early Miocene pulse of the mid-Cenozoic ignimbrite flare-up. The Guazapares Mining District and Cerocahui basin regions share this stratigraphy, but the rocks in the Cerocahui basin consist of a much higher proportion of alluvial deposits. The timing of extensional faulting and magmatism in the Guazapares Mining District and Cerocahui regions is consistent with regional-scale Middle Eocene to Early Miocene southwestward migration of active volcanism and extension in the northern Sierra Madre Occidental. Extension accompanied mafic-intermediate and silicic volcanism in the study area, and overlapped with the peak of mid-Cenozoic ignimbrite flare-up in the Sierra Madre Occidental; this supports the interpretation that there is likely a relationship between lithospheric extension and silicic large igneous province magmatism. Silicic large igneous provinces are significant in the geologic record, due to their unusually extensive areal coverage (>100,000 km2) and large volumes (>250,000 km3), and may be characteristic of continental regions undergoing broad lithospheric extension. The Sierra Madre Occidental of northwestern Mexico is the biggest and best-preserved silicic large igneous province of the Cenozoic and is considered part of the extensive mid-Cenozoic ignimbrite flare-up that affected much of the southwestern North American Cordillera. Despite its size and preservation, very little is known about the geology of the Sierra Madre Occidental, and the timing and spatial extent of ignimbrite flare-up volcanism in relation to crustal extension is relatively unknown. This study presents new geologic mapping, stratigraphy, zircon U-Pb laser ablation ICP-MS dating, modal analysis, and geochemical data from the Guazapares Mining District and Cerocahui basin regions, two adjacent areas of the northern Sierra Madre Occidental in western Chihuahua. The rock exposure and topographic relief in this previously unmapped ~450 km2 area make it ideal for studying the relationships between silicic large igneous province volcanism and crustal extension. The main geologic structures in the Guazapares Mining District and Cerocahui basin regions are NNW-trending normal faults, with an estimated minimum of 20% total horizontal extension. Many normal faults bound half-graben basins that show evidence of syndepositional extension. Normal faulting began by ca. 27.5 Ma during deposition of the youngest ignimbrites of the Parajes formation, concurrent with the end of the Early Oligocene silicic ignimbrite pulse of the ignimbrite flare-up to the east and before magmatism began in the study area. Preexisting normal faults localized mafic-intermediate volcanic vents of the Temoris formation and silicic vents of the Sierra Guazapares formation, and were active during deposition of these formations. In addition, the localization and timing of epithermal mineralization in the Guazapares Mining District appears to be favored where pre-to-synvolcanic extensional structures are in close association with Sierra Guazapares formation rhyolite plugs.",Mexico,-102.552784,23.634501,64

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Alexander R. Simms,"Recent studies along the northwestern Gulf of Mexico document rapid back-stepping of estuarine environments of up to 20 km and 150 m/yr at ca. 8.2 thousand years ago (ka), 4.8, ka, and 2.6 ka. If such rapid changes in coastal environments occurred today along the urbanized coast of the Gulf of Mexico major economical and ecological loss would occur. Of these three backstepping events, only one can be tied to a known cause---the 8.2 ka event related to a rapid increase in the rate of relative sea-level rise. However, the cause of the latter two, the 4.8 and 2.6 ka events are largely unknown. To determine the relative roles of changes in sea level and climate in these two events, paleo sea-level (Chapter 2), climate (Chapter 3), and stratigraphic records (Chapter 4) are presented from upper Baffin Bay, Texas and neighboring playa Laguna Salada. As commonly used high-resolution sea-level indicators are absent from the southern Texas Coast, a new sea-level indicator is needed. I test the use of intertidal microbial mats in reconstructing Holocene sea levels from Baffin, Bay Texas (Chapter 2). The indicative range of microbial mats is +/-0.29 m, much less than the +/-2 m indicative range of typical sea-level indicators currently used along the semiarid Texas coast. The elevations of 22 buried radiocarbon-dated microbial mats plot within error of relative sea-level data derived from the central Texas coast for the past 5.0 ky indicating that microbial mats provide a robust proxy for paleo--sea levels along semiarid and arid coastlines. The high-resolution microbial mat relative sea-level record derived from the tectonically stable central Texas coast also provides a test of recently proposed Holocene Highstands based on emergent coastal deposits in Texas and Alabama. The microbial mat relative sea-level data, similar to relative sea-level data derived from Mississippi Delta basal peats and lower-resolution Texas estuarine bivalves, indicates an ever-decreasing rate of relative sea-level rise since ca. 5.0 ka and precludes the possibility of Holocene Highstands in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Paleoclimate records are also sparse along the southern Texas coast. A new quantitative drought proxy is derived from a transfer function between X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) elemental data from a Texas playa and a tree-ring drought record (Chapter 3). Using this transfer function, a 954-year tree-ring drought record was extended to ca. 3,000 ka. Ba, Br, and Pb were utilized as predictor variables. Machine learning algorithms, utilized to derive the transfer function, had maximum validation accuracies of 94%. Changes in the extended drought record correspond with the timing of the Roman Climate Optimum, Medieval Warm Period, Little Ice Age, and changes in North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SST). Increased drought frequency is coeval with nearby dune migration ca. 0.2 ka, 1.9 ka, and 2.6 ka. The highest drought frequency in the record occurs during the Medieval Warm Period ca. 1.0 ka followed by a decrease in drought frequency during the Little Ice Age ca. 0.4 ka. Increased drought frequency accompanies increased North Atlantic SST since 3 ka. This trend of warm North Atlantic SST and dry conditions over the study area follows secular meteorological observations and tree-ring records. These results indicate that lacustrine derived XRF element data can be used as a quantitative tool to reconstruct past drought records, and that North Atlantic SST modulated drought in southern Texas for the last 3,000 years. Within Baffin Bay, five flooding surfaces making periods of abrupt environmental change, between 1.1--1.0 ka, 2.7--2.1 ka, 3.8--3.0 ka, 5.2--4.9 ka, and 6.5--5.7 ka occur through a time-period of ever decreasing rates of relative sea-level rise and within error of periods of drying in southern Texas at ca. 1.0 ka, 2.6 ka, 3.4 ka, 4.8 ka, and 5.5 ka (Chapter 4). I hypothesize that these flooding surfaces, occurring when sea level in the Gulf of Mexico was rising < 2 mm/yr, and during independently documented drying events, were primarily driven by changes in climate through declines in fluvial sediment supply to the coast.",Mexico,-102.552784,23.634501,64

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Alexander R. Simms,"The economic importance of coastlines highlights the need to understand how coasts evolve in response to changing climate. Prior work suggests that many of the estuaries in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico underwent large changes at 2.6, 4.8, and 8.2 ka. Twenty-eight vibracores, eight Geoprobe cores, twenty-eight radiocarbon ages, and twenty-five kilometers of seismic profiles were used to determine the response of the Nueces Bay-head Delta to the 2.6 ka and 4.8 ka events. Within the cores we identified nine sedimentary facies representing five distinct deltaic environments. Within the 25 kilometers of seismic data, we identified five seismic facies that correspond to the deltaic environments identified within the sediment cores. Fifteen sand lobes interpreted to be buried mouth-bar deposits identified in the seismic profiles and cores were used to track changes in the location of the seaward edge of the delta through the middle to late Holocene. Following progradation of the delta at 7.5 ka, the delta underwent two backstepping events in which the delta front transgressed up to 20 km at 4.8 ka and 2.6 ka. Following these two backstepping events the delta prograded up to 20 km seaward of the deltas maximum landward location. During delta progradation from 4.8-3.2 ka delivering 8.3x103 m3/yr of sand was delivered to the delta. During delta backstepping from 3.2-2.6 ka 6.5x103 m3/yr of sand was delivered to the delta. During the last phase of delta progradation from 2.6 ka-present delivering 6.6x103 m3/yr of sand was delivered to the delta. The decrease in the volume of sand delivered to the delta during the backstepping event at a time when the rate of sea-level rise as sea-level rise was decreasing and regional records of climate show drying suggests that the backstepping events were likely driven by climate changes.",Mexico,-102.552784,23.634501,64

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Phillip B. Gans,"The history of late Miocene (Proto-Gulf) deformation on the Sonoran margin of the Gulf of California is key to understanding how Baja California was captured by the Pacific plate and how strain was partitioned during the Proto-Gulf period (12.5-6 Ma). The Sierra el Aguaje and Sierra Tinajas del Carmen are located in southwestern coastal Sonora, Mexico, and represent the eastern rifted margin of the central Gulf of California. The ranges are composed of volcanic units and their corresponding volcaniclastic units which are the result of persistent magmatic activity between 20 and 8.8 Ma, including three packages of basalt and andesite that make excellent paleomagnetic recorders. Based on cross cutting relations and geochronologic data for pre-, syn-, and post-tectonic volcanic units, most of the faulting and tilting in the Sierra El Aguaje is bracketed between 11.9 and 9.0 Ma, thus falling entirely within Proto-Gulf time. A paleomagnetic investigation into possible vertical axis rotations in the Sierra el Aguaje has uncovered evidence of clockwise rotations between ~13 and ~105 with possible translations. These results are consistent with existing field relations, which suggest the presence of large (>45) vertical axis rotations in this region. This evidence includes: a) abrupt changes in the strike of tilted strata in different parts of the range, including large domains characterized by E-W strikes b) ubiquitous NE-SW striking faults with left lateral-normal oblique slip, that terminate against major NW-trending right lateral faults, and c) obliquity between the general strike of tilted strata and the strike of faults. These rotations occurred after 12 Ma and largely prior to 9 Ma, thus falling into the Proto-Gulf period. Such large-scale rotations lend credence to the theory that the area inboard of Baja California was experiencing transtension during the Proto-Gulf period, rather than the pure extension that would be the result of strain partitioning between Sonora and the Tosco-Abreojos fault offshore Baja California.",Mexico,-102.552784,23.634501,64

Governance refers to the decision-making processes at work in a given aggregate of people or territory, along with the more material outcomes of those processes, and affects social, political, economic, and cultural spheres. Therefore, changing governance has the potential to create comprehensive, systemic changes within those aggregates of people or territory, particularly for those who have been excluded from the benefits or even protection of existing processes. With this in mind, this project seeks to explore participatory governance as one possible avenue for systemic change. The following questions guide this exploration: What is participatory governance? Can it be an effective way for marginalized peoples to create alternative systems and structures to the ones that currently oppress them? By considering two living cases of participatory governance, in Mexico and Venezuela, this paper argues that participatory governance processes better serve the immediate needs of marginalized peoples and also empower them to create alternative, emancipatory systems by changing the priorities of governance through collective decision making. These questions are explored through the writings of those who are directly impacted by the participatory processes investigated in this piece, from both Mexico and Venezuela, as well as those who may have a different kind of stake in this debate, as outside observers, and sometimes as activists in their own contexts.

Seeking alternatives is important because we live on a planet with finite resources, a growing population with disparate levels of consumption, and a changing climate. Conflict over arable land, clean water, and other valuable resources only promises to increase in the future, as communities face desertification or soil collapse, sea level rise, and regional conflict.

Research subjects were categorized as having ""successful"" and ""unsuccessful"" street exits based on their ability to stay off the street and parent their children. Primary findings were that mothers in the ""unsuccessful"" category had experienced violence at a greater rate both in their families of origin and on the street and were also more likely to suffer from mental health problems, especially suicidal ideation. Also, the ""unsuccessful"" mothers were more likely to have migrated to the street at a younger age and to have used drugs for a longer period of time. There was not a significant statistical difference between the education levels, duration on the street, labor histories or age of drug initiation between the two groups. These findings were based on analysis of archival research of prior residents at SEDAC. In addition, the findings were fortified by ethnographic observations conducted by the researcher on the streets with Casa Alianza's street educators and within the resident shelters of Casa Alianza and SEDAC, as well as by interviews with personnel of both organizations. The chief practical finding of this research for social welfare agencies that provide for street youth is that a focus on mental health and recovery from trauma and abuse should be an integral part of efforts to help adolescent mothers transition off of the street and successfully parent their children. ,",Mexico,-102.552784,23.634501,64

The dissertation presents detailed case studies of three family clusters, the Enriquez Mendez and the Leon Jaramillo, both of which immigrated originally from Portugal, to Spain and then to colonial Mexico. The third cluster is a smaller family led by a single mother, Ana Enriquez, who along with her daughter Isabel immigrated from Spain to colonial Mexico and became part of the merchant elite described above. All members of these three families were tried during this period, but had very different circumstances. In all three families, however, there was a generational divide between the generation of those who emigrated and continued to faithfully practice their Judaism, and the next generation of their children, who did not practice Judaism as readily. Furthermore, those children identified more closely with the multi-ethnic setting and the Hispanic Christianity they found in colonial Mexico. The sources about these families consisted of archival material, especially the Inquisition trials in which the witness depositions of the accused and of other witnesses describe not only the religion of these families, but their day-to-day lives as well.

History",History,"Zaragosa Vargas, Paul R. Spickard","The late nineteenth and early twentieth century Rocky Mountain West coal mining region was a hub of migration, relocation, new settlements, and sites for the construction of new social identities as waves of workers and their families arrived in search of work. Mexican and Mexican Americans constituted an integral segment of these mining communities. The unforgiving nature and seclusion of the mountainous environment forced miners and their families to draw on their resources and ingenuity to struggle for their daily needs. This is a study of the relationship between family, community, and worker militancy amongst Mexican and Mexican American men and women through the use of networking and reciprocity. I begin my study by examining the immigration and migration of Mexicans to the Rocky Mountain West in response to work opportunities in the bituminous mines. I argue that work, the collective culture of the mining communities, and class struggle in this geographic region produced a unique working class experience that shaped and reshaped the lives of Mexican and Mexican Americans. I will delineate the growth and consolidation of these early mining communities that in essence were industrial colonies and then examine Mexican and Mexican American's participation in and shaping of the culture, values, institutions, and shared experiences of the mining camps. This is followed by a discussion of the lives of Mexicans in relation to other ethnic mine camp dwellers, all of whom lived in the ""foreign"" section of the camps. The welfare of mine camp households was contingent upon miner's wages. The shared experiences of day-to-day survival drew mine camp residents together into tight community networks. Mine companies dominated politics and society; however, trade unionism and radical politics likewise distinguished the mining camps and enriched community life. Socialists frequently visited the camps, and the Industrial Workers of the World were leading activists who inspired the miner and their families to militancy and added to outbursts of radical activism. I draw on strike actions in southern and northern Colorado from the 1880s to the 1920s to illustrate my argument, particularly the 1914 Ludlow Massacre and the 1927 Columbine Coal Strike.",Mexico,-102.552784,23.634501,64

Linguistics",Linguistics,Carol Genetti,"This thesis presents an analysis of the system of transitivity, voice and valency alternations in Huasteco of San Luis Potosi (Mayan) within a functional-typological framework. The study is based on spoken discourse and elicited data collected in the municipalities of Aquismon and Tancanhuitz de Santos in the state of San Luis Potosi, Mexico. The research presented here contributes to the typological understanding of valency and voice, as well as to the better understanding of these phenomena within the Mayan linguistic family. In this thesis a detailed morphological analysis of voice and valency in SLP Huasteco is set forth, together with a description of the intricate interaction between the lexical, morphological, syntactic and discourse level in the expression of events in this language. The thesis distinguishes between the lexical-semantic property of valency and the syntactic-pragmatic property of transitivity, which corresponds to a finer distinction between valency alternations and voice proper, and is reflected in the structural encoding of these phenomena. This thesis proposes a subcategorization of SLP Huasteco verbs based on their morphosyntactic behavior with respect to valency and valency alternations that in turn corresponds to their lexical semantic properties. The thesis considers verb roots and thematic suffixes to be central to the encoding of valency. It presents the encoding of valency alternations with ambitransitive roots as well as valency augmenting suffixes, mainly causatives and applicatives. This dissertation also describes the forms and functions of the antipassive and passive voices, and concludes that the Huasteco antipassive has the main semantic/pragmatic function of lowering the transitivity of the clause, whereas the passive has in most cases the syntactic/pragmatic function of putting the prominent topical third-person participant into the absolutive argument of the intransitive clause. In sum, this study shows that this intricate interaction between different levels of the structure is central to the understanding of the grammar of this language, and that fine distinctions in meaning and function correspond to finely nuanced grammatical forms.",Mexico,-102.552784,23.634501,64

Robinson,"Policing the Wretched examines the transnationalization of systems of racism, class exploitation, criminalization, militarized policing, and social control throughout North and Central America in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century. It provides a sociological, historical, and materialist analysis of the militarization of the Los Angeles Police Department, the policing of youth and surplus labor populations in El Salvador, the so-called ""war on drugs"" in Mexico, and the emergence of hip hop as a cultural form of expression in the heavily policed Pico Union district of Los Angeles to conceptualize what I call ""transnational apparatuses of social control"". It demonstrates that during the epoch of global capitalism, repressive nation-state apparatuses have taken transnational dimensions. It shows that these forms of social control should be understood alongside neoliberal policies such as structural adjustments programs (SAPs) and free trade policies, and the proposed ""wars"" on drugs, crime, gangs, terrorism, and anti-migrant policies in this region. It illustrates that the transnationalization of social control emerged as a response to social and economic crises that have developed from neoliberalism, racial and social inequality, and the emergence of grassroots social movements. While remaining attentive to the repressive apparatuses of social control in a transnational context, Policing the Wretched also examines how social movements in Los Angeles, Mexico City, and San Salvador have contested neoliberal policies, security initiatives, and militarization. Through interviews, participant observations, and archival research (government documents, congressional reports, and studies; presidential addresses; media sources and journalist accounts; and non-governmental literature, studies, and research) spanning three countries, the project traces the ways in which social movements in the U.S., Mexico, and El Salvador have mobilized and waged a relentless struggle over hegemony that provides an alternative social warrant that places democracy over securitization and human rights over property rights. It concludes by showing how hip hop in Los Angeles delineates acritique of transnational social control and a culture of resistance.

Sociology",Sociology,"William I. Robinson, Juan-Vicente Palerm","This dissertation examines the interplay between processes of globalization and transnational migration and their impact at the micro level in the understudied area of gendered household economic strategies in both sending and receiving communities. Drawing on a multi-sited ethnography study which employed a two-phase mixed methods approach, I analyzed migration histories, occupational mobility, migration dispersion in the U.S., and household economic strategies, in two transnational communities: 1) Acayahualco, Guerrero Mexico and Santa Barbara, CA and 2) Mayanalan, Guerrero Mexico and Wilmington, DE. To ascertain key socio-demographic features of the populations under study, I developed a 162-item survey that I administered to 90 households in the sending communities of Guerrero, Mexico. The survey results were both complemented and challenged by my multi-sited ethnographic research comprising 50 in-depth interviews, along with participant observation in the sending and receiving communities. This study offers two contributions to sociology: in the one hand it examines the ways in which globalization takes place at the local level, specifically in the social context of international migration. By undertaking this type of dialectic analysis of the global and the local, this study sheds light on the individual's response capabilities and, more importantly, on their agency power in the face of global processes. This proactive agency on the part of the transnational migrant families becomes evident as they are observed looking constantly for ways to ""stretch their limited resources"" to cover expenses by relying on their unlimited resourcefulness. In this context, international migration should not be viewed simply as a survival strategy for peasant families, but, as a mechanism of reaction and resistance against global capitalism barriers. On the other hand, I demonstrated throughout this work, the social phenomenon of international migration in these two communities, and within their domestic units, is the result of an accumulative and uninterrupted process that has been shaped by a vast number of learning experiences, social and cultural exchanges, and innovative and resourceful practices to cope with the challenges of becoming transnational. The transnational perspective allows us to underscore how, in spite of being physically separated by great distances, the development of household economic strategies by migrants and their families are deeply linked. This transnational linkage allows migrants and their families in their communities of origins to cope with the challenges of a globalized economy that has been detrimental to their living conditions. In this sense, the results of my study counter the view that sees migrants and their families in their communities of origin as puppets controlled by forces beyond their own control. Rather, this study emphasizes how migrants and their families with hard-working ethics look for opportunities to improve their socioeconomic circumstances and enhance their living conditions.",Mexico,-102.552784,23.634501,64

Spanish and Portuguese",Spanish and Portuguese,Ellen McCracken,"Lastly, this dissertation connects the fields of Digital Humanities and Hispanic literature. Recent trends in literary criticism, which were previously labeled as ""non-normative"" methods of study, are now considered acceptable. These methods include different types of computer-assisted or machine readings as well as textual visualizations. However, there is a lack of representation of using these digital tools in the field of Hispanic literature; this dissertation responds directly to this void. Reforming Deforming, and Performing: Remixing Digital and Traditional Approaches to Jose Agustin's La tumba by Claire Elizabeth Ihlendorf Burke This dissertation focuses on the novel La tumba, by Mexican author, Jose Agustin and explores this 1960s text through a digital lens. La tumba, written by Agustin when he was just seventeen, follows the life of a young, urban, upper-class protagonist who is disillusioned with his life and society in Mexico City in the beginning of the 1960s. What my re-reading of La tumba aspires to contribute to the existing critical landscape is summarized by three goals. The framework for my textual experimentation comes from the concept of deformance by Jerome McGann and Lisa Samuels. For the purposes of my investigations, I extend this concept from poetry (as McGann and Samuels outline) to an entire novel. I combine my analysis of the deformances with traditional textual analysis/close reading scholarship. I also explore performances of the novel through social media platforms in order to consider the text in a modern-day format. This structure supports the secondary goal of my work, which is to propose new methodology that can be applicable in the study of other novels, regardless of language. The tools and methods I use can be adopted for literary analysis, but also have utility in a teaching capacity. Secondly, my work acts as a model for the study of other texts. Agustin has never been examined with a computer-assisted close reading and my dissertation acts as an example of what can be done for future study of other texts and further investigations of Agustin's work. I explore case studies in which I used both deformances and performances of the text in a classroom setting to gauge the pedagogical implications of these methods. My research demonstrates the new perspectives and insights gained by using digital tools and visualizations, and while doing so, I demonstrate how these methodologies can be employed in the study of other texts. Firstly, my reading demonstrates a new degree of investigation, examining previously undiscovered perspectives of this classic text. I base my analysis of a re-mapping of the text by combining new and traditional hermeneutics. Where previous scholars have limited their scope purely on linguistic elements of this text, I offer new outlets for analysis that extend beyond the existing readings. Through this work I explore the relationships in the text, specifically those between the female characters and the protagonist.",Mexico,-102.552784,23.634501,64

Spanish and Portuguese",Spanish and Portuguese,Francisco Lomeli,"My dissertation uses an interdisciplinary approach to examine the representation of the crisis of the family in contemporary Latin American cinema of the first decade of the twenty-first century. I argue that the representation of the crisis of the family in certain postmodern Latin American films is a symbol of the effects of the violent transition to a globalized world put into practice by authoritarian regimes and dirty wars. The motif of incest -and in lesser extent, of parricide- is a polysemic narrative device that operates as a sign for the impossibility of representation of the historic events of the recent past, the effects of which emerge as a phantasmagoric (post)memory and discontent in the Latin American society of the present. The cinematic works I discuss include eleven recent films from Argentina, Chile, Peru, Brazil, and Mexico: the Peruvian films Ojos que no ven (2003) by Francisco Lombardi, Jose Mendez's Dias de Santiago (2004), and Claudia Llosa's Madeinusa (2006); Sebastian Lelio's La sagrada familia (2004), Pablo Larrain's Fuga (2006), and Tony Manero (2008) from Chile; the Argentinean Geminis (2005) by Albertina Carri, and Lucia Puenzo's El nino pez (2009); Matheus Nachtergaele's A festa da menina morta (2008) from Brazil; Ricardo Montreuil's La mujer de mi hermano (2005), a Mexican, Peruvian, and Chilean co-production; and Carlos Reygadas's Batalla en el cielo (2005) from Mexico. Based on this cinematic selection, I propose that the representation of the crisis of the family, which emphasizes the transgression of the incest taboo, and parricide as motifs or recurrent themes, is an allegory of the culmination of a crisis, and at the same time, operates as an allegory of a symptom and critical device of the homogenized values of the patriarchal order that has lost its legitimacy. The criticism of these values focuses on the different modes of articulation of the roles in the family in terms of class, ethnicity, gender and sexuality, which questions at the same time the foundation of modernity as a homogeneous system that the postmodern narrative defies and fragments. The transgression of the incest taboo as a fundamentally masculine act, is at the same time an excess of power, and indicates that what is at question here is the patriarchal discourse as a valid and endurable one in a more heterogeneous and multifaceted emerging postmodern society at the threshold of the new century.",Mexico,-102.552784,23.634501,64

Spanish and Portuguese",Spanish and Portuguese,Sara Poot Herrera,"This study examines the relationship between the Latin American journalistic cronica (""chronicle"") and memory, specifically the way writers used highly imaginative cronicas as a means to uphold or challenge official memory and history and to propose ""alternative"" readings of the nation during Mexico's centenary and bicentenary commemorations of Independence of 1910, 1921, and 2010. The centenarios were times when historical memory was of paramount importance and that foregrounded two long-standing obsessions of the cronica: the topic of national identity and an interest in great historical events. Positing the cronica as a sort of literary lieu de memoire (""site of memory""), the study analyzes works from Mexican and Mexican American cronistas (""chroniclers"") drawn from current and turn-of-the-century periodical sources including writings by Juan B. Urrutia, ""Cagliostro,"" Rafael Lopez, Jose D. Frias, Jose de Jesus Nunez y Dominguez, Jorge Ulica (Julio G. Arce), Carlos Monsivais, Rafael Perez Gay, and Hermann Bellinghausen. The study contends that the modern cronica (1910, 1921) and the postmodern cronica (2010) as works of memory differ in their literary treatment of events, partly due to the changing role of the cronista as well as changes in the form/content, functions, and reception of the literary chronicle from one century to the next. In the case of the Mexican independence celebrations examined here, ""alternative histories"" or narratives of the nation's past also responded to changes associated with the paradigmatic shift from modernity to postmodernity. While for turn-of-the-century modernista writers, for instance, the cronica itself was an experiment in creative journalism, cronicas today, often published in blogs, or online journals or newspapers, involve new forms of experimentation, are not necessarily published by professional writers or intellectuals, and may involve reader participation (or ""modification"" of official memory through online commentary and social networking tools). Furthermore, while nineteenth-century cronicas sought to express a singular, monolithic version of national identity, now postmodern or late twentieth and early twenty-first century cronistas tend to question such metanarratives or ""all-encompassing"" explanations of knowledge or ""absolute truths"". Todays cronistas also seem less likely to function as an authoritative source of knowledge (or ""memory""), as readers now have the ability to quickly and easily verify information on their own (via the internet) and to interact with electronically published texts to question them or to provide their own versions of ""what happened""; that is, to provide countermemories. Critical studies to date have been unable to provide a definition of the literary cronica that accounts for diachronic changes as well as issues relating to the genre's formal hybridity (between literature and journalism) or its official or unofficial stance toward state-backed concerns. I argue, however, that reading the cronica as memory transcends these questions and provides an important bridge to a more all-inclusive definition of the genre, thus establishing its significance in the literary canon and offering an additional approach to its critical study.",Mexico,-102.552784,23.634501,64

Spanish and Portuguese",Spanish and Portuguese,Ellen McCracken,"To date, no lengthy study has examined queer sexualities and space in Latin American film. In three chapters organized around different spatial scales, I theorize how spatiality reflects and affects the development and expression of queer sexuality in eight films from throughout Latin America. In the first chapter, I explore public and private spaces in relation to queer sexuality in Francisco J. Lombardi's No se lo digas a nadie (Peru 1998), Tomas Gutierrez Alea and Juan Carlos Tabio's Fresa y chocolate (Cuba 1993), and Jorge Fons's El callejon de los milagros (Mexico 1994). I argue that despite their attempts to carve out private spaces---with varying degrees of success---the queer characters in these films are not able to escape the influence of the public sphere and heteronormativity. In Chapter Two, I examine the relationship between queer sexualities and city space. I argue that in Enrique Bochichio's El cuarto de Leo (Uruguay 2009) Montevideo is presented as a sort of utopia, a liberating space for individuals who may choose to come out of the closet. By conflating homosexuality with criminality, Marcelo Pineyro's Plata quemada (Argentina 2000), on the other hand, depicts the traditionally oppressive, unsustainable relationship between the city and homosexuals. In Chapter Three, I explore the use of the body as a space for working through issues of queer sexuality. In the films that I analyze, there is an increasing degree of materialization of the body as space. In Javier Fuentes-Leon's Contracorriente (Peru 2009), the ghost of the protagonist's dead lover serves as a sort of mirror that helps the protagonist cope with his sexuality. In Karim Ainouz's Madame Sata (Brazil 2002), issues of sexual identity, gender, race, and class are consolidated in the body of a cross-dressing performer. In Lucia Puenzo's XXY (Argentina 2007), the concern for the body as space is materialized to the greatest extent. The protagonist is an intersexed adolescent whose body serves as a space that represents not only her internal struggles, but also those of her parents and the society within which she does not neatly fit.",Mexico,-102.552784,23.634501,64

However, there is a lack of representation of using these digital tools in the field of Hispanic literature; this dissertation responds directly to this void. Reforming Deforming, and Performing: Remixing Digital and Traditional Approaches to Jose Agustin's La tumba by Claire Elizabeth Ihlendorf Burke This dissertation focuses on the novel La tumba, by Mexican author, Jose Agustin and explores this 1960s text through a digital lens. La tumba, written by Agustin when he was just seventeen, follows the life of a young, urban, upper-class protagonist who is disillusioned with his life and society in Mexico City in the beginning of the 1960s. What my re-reading of La tumba aspires to contribute to the existing critical landscape is summarized by three goals. The framework for my textual experimentation comes from the concept of deformance by Jerome McGann and Lisa Samuels. For the purposes of my investigations, I extend this concept from poetry (as McGann and Samuels outline) to an entire novel. I combine my analysis of the deformances with traditional textual analysis/close reading scholarship. I also explore performances of the novel through social media platforms in order to consider the text in a modern-day format. This structure supports the secondary goal of my work, which is to propose new methodology that can be applicable in the study of other novels, regardless of language. The tools and methods I use can be adopted for literary analysis, but also have utility in a teaching capacity. Secondly, my work acts as a model for the study of other texts. Agustin has never been examined with a computer-assisted close reading and my dissertation acts as an example of what can be done for future study of other texts and further investigations of Agustin's work. I explore case studies in which I used both deformances and performances of the text in a classroom setting to gauge the pedagogical implications of these methods. My research demonstrates the new perspectives and insights gained by using digital tools and visualizations, and while doing so, I demonstrate how these methodologies can be employed in the study of other texts. Firstly, my reading demonstrates a new degree of investigation, examining previously undiscovered perspectives of this classic text. I base my analysis of a re-mapping of the text by combining new and traditional hermeneutics. Where previous scholars have limited their scope purely on linguistic elements of this text, I offer new outlets for analysis that extend beyond the existing readings.

Spanish and Portuguese",Spanish and Portuguese,Sara Poot-Herrera,"D. H. Lawrence, Graham Greene and Malcolm Lowry traveled individually to Mexico during the 1920s and 1930s. In their respective trips, these three authors tried to know and analyze not only the place but the people who lived in it.

Three English novels situated in Mexican space. The impact that post-colonial studies have had in understanding the imposed perspective of previous empires over other regions makes it impossible to sustain that this representation of the other is ""transparent"", that it's not mediated by form. Some concepts belonging to the study of rhetorical analysis---such as focalization and characterization---allow me to discover the different points of view that are at play in the creation of stories that describe a space not only unknown to the reader, but even new within the literary universe that subscribes them. These three novels inherit almost directly the narratives of exploration and travel of the 16th and 17th centuries. Therefore, they reflect an old narrative tradition of writing about what has been explored, of knowing a space and then recreating it in words as the background for travels that have been lived. This project focuses in revealing the rhetorical techniques used by the authors to transform Mexico into the setting for different narrative worlds. By referring their readers continually to a country that has been visited, explored and surveyed by themselves, the writers contribute to the formation of one coherent narrative universe whose meaning is distributed throughout the three novels, but all together conforms what I've called Mexican space. This narrative world was founded by Lawrence, but Greene and Lowry follow in his footsteps and contribute to it. By not only situating their novels in a country that's explicitly referred to as ""Mexico"", but giving them the same thematic background---a religious upheaval---these writers create a consistent image of Mexico as a religious country where modern men go to seek spiritual reconnection in the period between two World Wars. The narrative space created by Lawrence, Greene and Lowry is then equally Mexican and religious, but this qualities are presented through a collection of sites and places that I've grouped for their analyses in four categories: topographical space, social space, religious space and movement. By reading these novels through their spacial representations, I propose a view of Mexico as a trope, a topos, in English literature that was created and solidified in the novels written by Lawrence, Greene and Lowry.",Mexico,-102.552784,23.634501,64

Spanish and Portuguese",Spanish and Portuguese,Sara Poot Herrera,"This study examines the relationship between the Latin American journalistic cronica (""chronicle"") and memory, specifically the way writers used highly imaginative cronicas as a means to uphold or challenge official memory and history and to propose ""alternative"" readings of the nation during Mexico's centenary and bicentenary commemorations of Independence of 1910, 1921, and 2010. The centenarios were times when historical memory was of paramount importance and that foregrounded two long-standing obsessions of the cronica: the topic of national identity and an interest in great historical events. Positing the cronica as a sort of literary lieu de memoire (""site of memory""), the study analyzes works from Mexican and Mexican American cronistas (""chroniclers"") drawn from current and turn-of-the-century periodical sources including writings by Juan B. Urrutia, ""Cagliostro,"" Rafael Lopez, Jose D. Frias, Jose de Jesus Nunez y Dominguez, Jorge Ulica (Julio G. Arce), Carlos Monsivais, Rafael Perez Gay, and Hermann Bellinghausen.

Research subjects were categorized as having ""successful"" and ""unsuccessful"" street exits based on their ability to stay off the street and parent their children. Primary findings were that mothers in the ""unsuccessful"" category had experienced violence at a greater rate both in their families of origin and on the street and were also more likely to suffer from mental health problems, especially suicidal ideation. Also, the ""unsuccessful"" mothers were more likely to have migrated to the street at a younger age and to have used drugs for a longer period of time. There was not a significant statistical difference between the education levels, duration on the street, labor histories or age of drug initiation between the two groups. These findings were based on analysis of archival research of prior residents at SEDAC. In addition, the findings were fortified by ethnographic observations conducted by the researcher on the streets with Casa Alianza's street educators and within the resident shelters of Casa Alianza and SEDAC, as well as by interviews with personnel of both organizations. The chief practical finding of this research for social welfare agencies that provide for street youth is that a focus on mental health and recovery from trauma and abuse should be an integral part of efforts to help adolescent mothers transition off of the street and successfully parent their children. ,",Mexico City,-99.133208,19.4326077,5

Sociology",Sociology,Kum-Kum Bhavnani,"This study examines the lived realities of Haitian Americans residing in Miami, Florida. By drawing on theories of global capitalism, migration, transnationalism, and diaspora it explores how the experience of Haitian migrants living in the Miami community of Little Haiti offer insights as to whether transnational, diasporic communities are uniquely placed to become socially aware and political active within their diasporic communities . Most studies on Haitians in the United States focus on New York. However, those residing in the global city of Miami are a unique population of mostly working-class Haitians who, marginalized by U.S. politicians, the media, and migrant groups in Florida, are rendered precarious. Such experiences can push Haitian migrants to maintain transnational links and form diasporic communities in areas such as the ethnic enclave of Little Haiti. Through participant observation and semi-structured interviews with Haitian volunteers and employees at the Little Haiti Community Support Center (LHCSC), in July 2014 I explored the lived experiences of politically engaged Haitian migrants residing in this diasporic community. From the interviews emerged a hybrid, at times ambivalent, diasporic political and cultural consciousness maintained through transnational forms of solidarity. Political consciousness developed in community and in strategic collaborations with other Black diasporic groups. Cultural consciousness functioned as a tool of empowerment and a medium for critiques of U.S. policies, aspects of Haitian culture, and gender norms. Activism solidified communities and families and cultivated new practices to pass on to the next generation. Using the LHCSC as an example of a transnational, politically active site of community, this paper explores how an ethnic community becomes unified as diaspora, and more socially and globally aware as a consequence of their migrant experience.",Miami,-80.1917902,25.7616798,1

Sociology",Sociology,Fernando Lopez-Alves,"The local food movement offers the simple premise that changing the way we eat can change the world. As the global adoption of neoliberal practices has encouraged the ""privatization of survival,"" where states deregulate, sell, and commodify social services once provided for free or at low cost, people without monetary means to access them have gone into debt or gone without. This reduction in public services, rising unemployment rates, soaring fuel and food costs, and a ""race to the bottom in food"" production that makes food less nutritious and less safe, have made more people unable to provide for basic needs and consume healthy food. Additionally, as neoliberal policies have triggered extreme economic inequality, acute difficulties meeting basic needs, and the erosion of political representation, people have responded by rejecting globalization outright or attempting to guide it down a more sustainable path. To better understand the nature of such responses to globalization, where the local food movement fits in, and how urban agriculture efforts in Detroit, Flint, and Ypsilanti are unique, this project documents how the local food movement seeks to relocalize the economy and adopt more sustainable consumption practices to counter the economic inequality, resource scarcity, and social fragmentation exacerbated by neoliberal policies and practices. This project is an ethnographic study of the local food movement in southeastern Michigan and California conducted through urban agriculture experiments and participant observation of farmers markets, urban farms, farmers' cooperatives, community and school gardens, restaurants, non-profits, and local food distribution networks. It also included an online survey investigating motives to support and participate in the local food movement, a comparison between the physical environment, food system, and social environment in Michigan and California, and informal interviews with growers, producers, eaters, chefs, and business owners. It found that although California agriculture is dominant in crop diversity, growing season, and production volume, Michigan has advantages in water and land access, food safety legislation, and zoning ordinances that enable urban agriculture initiatives to be more successful.",Michigan,-85.6023643,44.3148443,1

Aranye Fradenburg,"This dissertation explores Middle English literary texts that consistently portray ethics as a patently emotional affair. The introduction rehashes recent neuroscientific discourses that similarly assert the centrality of emotion in processes of ethical decision-making, as well as other contemporary theoretical and historiographic accounts of emotion. Chapter 1 argues that Middle English rhetorics of righteous and sinful anger played an important role both in sparking the Peasants' Revolt of 1381 and in retroactively reevaluating the dangers of uninhibited anger in the uprising's posttramatic wake. The second chapter discusses Middle English discourses on dread that suggest that devotees in late medieval England conceptualized the ascetic project of dreading well as integral to the ethical project of living well. The third chapter argues that the three successive versions of Piers Plowman, as we know them today, contain three strikingly different theologies of love and dread. Rather than reading these as evidence of one man's gradual movement from a theology of dread to one of love, it reimagines the production of Piers Plowman as a densely intersubjective affair that engendered a network of differing (and deferring) theologies of love and dread. Chapter 4 turns to the famous Middle English elegy Pearl, arguing that the Pearl-maiden does not prompt the dreamer to happily share in her celestial estate, but instead stirs his envy of her heavenly bliss, suggesting that terrestrial devotees ought to work through, rather than eschew, their envy of their celestial loved ones. Chapter 5 focuses on another poem solely attested in Cotton Nero A.x: Sir Gawain and the Green Knight. While critics often read Gawain's shame at the end of the poem as sundering him from his fellow courtiers, I read Gawain's shameful confession to the court as profoundly and successfully reparative of the homosocial, chivalric habitus wounded by Gawain's life loving transgression. Moving next to Geoffrey Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde, Chapter 6 builds on a scholarly tradition that reads Troilus as a masochistic courtly lover, arguing that, at the poem's conclusion, Troilus spontaneously transforms into a sadistic courtly hater. Since masochistic courtly love and sadistic courtly hate constitute different responses to social privilege, the courtly lover always already possesses the potential to morph suddenly into a courtly hater, as does Chaucer's Troilus when he channels his disappointment at having lost Criseyde's love into vengeful, militarized violence against any and all Greeks. Finally, by way of conclusion, I discuss some of the pedagogical implications of my research into Middle English ideologies of emotion, focusing particularly on the vexed question of how one might ethically teach medieval cultures of compassion.",Middle East,42.5509603,29.2985278,4

Film and Media Studies",Film and Media Studies,Michael Curtin,"How does hope emerge amidst a hopeless situation, freedom amidst apartheid, equality amidst inequality? In the context of Palestine, where is utopian located? A possible answer to these enigmas presented itself in a Freedom March organized by a group of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron in March 2013. Carrying Palestinian flags, they crossed into a forbidden zone, boldly walking into the section of the street designated for Jewish settlers only. On their faces were masks of Martin Luther King, Jr., in their hands were portraits of Rosa Parks, and on their shirts were four English words: ""I have a dream"". By resurrecting the imagery and iconography of the US Black Freedom Movement, these Palestinians were drawing new, imaginative constellations of counterhegemonic protest and forging transnational links of solidarity across time and space. The demonstrators thus staged a disruption. They temporarily interrupted the status quo and transgressed the rules and regulations of the hegemonic order. As a result, they were swiftly apprehended by uniformed members of the Israeli Defense Forces. As if to reenact a scene from Birmingham or Selma, the soldiers ripped the flags from the protesters' hands and placed them in handcuffs. With MLK masks still on their faces, the demonstrators were loaded onto trucks and quickly taken out of sight. The protest was thus brought to a halt almost as soon as it had begun. In this way, an attempt was made to contain the disruption, to restore the ruling regime of hierarchy and segregation, and to sew up the tear that the demonstrators had ripped in the symbolic universe. But while the protesters themselves could be forcibly removed from the scene, the images they left behind could not be so easily erased. Photographs of the demonstration were immediately published on the Internet and circulated on social media websites. Like apparitions from another dimension, these images demonstrate that another world is possible, a world without ethnic- or religious-determined divisions, a world without apartheid walls, security fences, or segregated streets. They show that the unthinkable can be made thinkable, that the invisible can be made visible, and that the impossible can be made possible. This staged news spectacle represents just one example of a larger trend. In Equality in the Shadows, I look at the role of film, media, and culture in the Palestinian struggle against Zionist colonization. Basing my dissertation on both Edward Said's notion of ""the Palestinian Idea"" and Jacques Ranciere's subversive redefinition of equality, I aim to show how through film and media, Palestinian liberation is not only a dream for a far-off and distant future but something that already exists in the present. While my dissertation has a strong foundation in film and media studies, I am drawing on a range of approaches, and I believe my work is relevant to scholars in a variety of disciplines including Black studies, cultural studies, Global and International Studies, Middle Eastern studies, politics, and sociology. Each chapter utilizes the work of several critical theorists, and I am attempting to put Palestinian media in conversation with writers such as Ernst Bloch, James Cone, Joan Copjec, Sigmund Freud, Stuart Hall, Dick Hebdige, C.L.R. James, Ghassan Kanafani, Robin D.G. Kelley, George Lipsitz, Catherine Malabou, Herbert Marcuse, and Slavoj Zizek.",Middle East,42.5509603,29.2985278,4

Film and Media Studies",Film and Media Studies,Peter Bloom,"This dissertation examines how imported TV series, including Spanish-language telenovelas and Turkish soap operas, have been culturally adapted by the second Moroccan channel, 2M, and the Middle East Broadcasting Center, MBC. The cultural adaptation of imported TV shows has relied on techniques of censorship in which sequences are re-edited and dubbed into Arabic dialects. This has marked a shift from earlier dubbing practices into traditional standard Arabic. The tightening of censorship restrictions has occurred because of the increasing accessibility of imported television shows given that they can now be more widely understood in local dialects. The alteration of essential dramatic events in these original television programs has, in several cases, distorted the narrative intent. An analysis of this type of censorship provides insights into how interrelated forms of political authoritarianism in the Arab world govern broadcast media. My dissertation also examines the social effects of Spanish-language telenovelas and Turkish soap operas on Arab viewers. The appearance of Spanish-language telenovelas on Moroccan television has heralded a more consumerist worldview particularly among young viewers aged 18-34. Many of these fans have expressed their admiration for depictions of luxury as represented by fashion, mansions, and expensive automobiles. The success of Turkish soap operas on MBC have found its most receptive audience among female viewers, who have started demanding a less authoritarian quality of interaction from their spouses. Depictions of the caring way Turkish male protagonists interact with female characters, who are presumably Muslim as well, has been a significant context for social change. Also, young female fans have used social media platforms, such as Facebook, to voice their moral and sexual preferences in men, taking Turkish fictional characters as their model. Arab female fans in the online fan communities increasingly discuss cultural taboos pertaining to male sexual appeal and their own physical and sexual preferences in men, expressing their aspirations for change in gender stereotypes and sexuality.",Middle East,42.5509603,29.2985278,4

Global and International Studies",Global and International Studies,Paul Amar,"The pivotal role Islamism will play in the post-Arab Spring global dynamic drives this thesis. It analyses the various origins and ideologies of the most seminal Islamist movement, the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood. As Egypt serves as the socio-political fulcrum of the Middle East North Africa region, so too stands the Muslim Brotherhood as the logical genesis for a discussion about the larger phenomenon of Islamism. My thesis argues that the Brotherhood specifically, and Islamism generally, offers far more flexibility in ideology than the West frequently concedes. Its development proves non-linear, complex and frequently interrupted by bifurcation; the ideologies it produced and still produces are therefore polymorphic, ranging from moderate and conciliatory to belligerent and radical. Which, if any, Islamism prevails in the Middle East will depend on the abilities of the various movements' leaders to offer beneficial alternatives to the decades of tyranny the masses rejected in the Arab Spring. I argue that by returning to the ideology of the Brotherhood's founding father, Hassan al-Banna, a moderate, conciliatory, and above all flexible interpretation of Islamism may be found. This requires a reconsideration of the radicalism that has spiraled out of the ranks of the Brotherhood, specifically acknowledging Sayyid Qutb's writings as aberrations of al Banna's message, rather than as natural evolutions. I conclude that Islamism and radical Islamism must be separated in academic and political discourse, treated as related but separate phenomena, in order to push the quotidial dialogue in a mutually generative direction. To do this, I first trace the historical trajectory of the Brotherhood, highlighting incidences of flexibility and cooperative methods of the movement to insure its survival through the tumultuous post-Colonial era. The second section highlights the Brotherhood's oscillations between radical and moderate ideological positions. My analysis demonstrates that the Muslim Brotherhood has a long history of pragmatic response to changing political situations. The West too often views the Muslim Brotherhood through the ""Clash of Civilization"" narrative -- in which the Muslim Brotherhood is one continuous, fixed entity in opposition to the West -- rather than acknowledging the bifurcated and malleable identity of the organization.",Middle East,42.5509603,29.2985278,4

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Lorraine Lisiecki,"The development of high quality age models for paleoclimate records is critical for constraining leads, lags, and rates of change within the climate system, which helps to elucidate the mechanisms of past climate changes. For example, improvements to age models for paleoclimate records from marine sediment cores were central to proving Milankovitch theory. In this dissertation, I compiled a quality-controlled database of almost 300 previously published benthic foraminiferal oxygen isotope (delta 18O) records from globally distributed sites. The only way to directly date marine sediments is by radiocarbon dating, but this technique can only be used back to about 40,000 years ago and is subject to uncertainties about past surface reservoir age changes. Chapter 2 presents an averaged high-latitude North Atlantic reservoir age reconstruction based on aligning 33 deep North Atlantic benthic delta18O records and comparing high- and low-latitude planktonic foraminiferal radiocarbon dates. This reconstruction shows increased reservoir ages during the beginning of the last deglaciation and the Younger Dryas, which suggests that previous chronologies based on the assumption of constant reservoir age need to be revised by up to about 1,000 years. North Atlantic reservoir ages are also a proxy for Atlantic meridional overturning circulation strength, so deglacial reservoir age excursions provide insight into the timing and role of ocean circulation changes during the deglaciation. Regional benthic delta18O stacks and chronologies fill an important niche between global stacks and studies comparing a few well-dated records. Chapter 3 presents seven different regional benthic delta 18O stacks with independent planktonic 14C-based age models for 0-40,000 years ago. The stacks show regional differences in the timing of benthic delta18O change of up to 4,000 years during the last deglaciation. In Chapters 4 and 5, the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian benthic delta18O stacks are extended beyond the limits of radiocarbon to 145,000 years ago and combined into a single volume-weighted global stack. The regional stacks aligned to proxy data with well-constrained absolute age estimates provide improved chronostratigraphic constraints for the last glacial cycle. The volume-weighted global stack demonstrates errors of up to 4,000 years in the currently accepted global benthic delta 18O stack.",Milan,9.189982,45.4642035,2

The document begins with historical information on the music, discussing its specific genres, tablature, and origins. Further, three composers, Luis Milan (1500-1561), Luys de Narvaez (fl. 1526-1549), and Alonso Mudarra (1508-1580), are discussed in detail. This study examines and offers insight into their lives and musical style. Eventually, my work in this area will expand to include the seven major vihuela composers. In later chapters, issues of performance practice are discussed, such as ornamentation, voice type, diction of early Spanish, and choice of instrument. Because so little has been written about this music in comparison to other genres of accompanied solo song, research posed no small challenge. The writings of John Ward and John Griffiths have been especially helpful. Both of these scholars have devoted their lives to this music and remain among the most respected experSts in the field. Their writings extensively informed this study. A unique part of our investigation is a section on the guitarist-singer collaboration. While there are many books dedicated to the pianist-singer collaboration, none familiar to me have been written on the collaboration between guitarist and singer. My own expertise as a performer served as the chief source of information. This section guides people in making the collaboration as effective as possible.

Music",Music,Scott L. Marcus,"Milwaukee, Wisconsin, boasts a vibrant Irish traditional music and dance community. Spurred on by a strong dance scene, numerous pub sessions, the cultural and educational influence of Milwaukee Irish Fest and its Summer School, and the transnational circulation of performers and audio recordings, local traditional musicians have developed considerable skills, as well as strong personal and collective styles. In a number of cases, musicians associate themselves, through the style and repertoire of their playing, with specific regional styles of traditional music in Ireland, such as those of County Donegal or Sliabh Luachra (Counties Cork and Kerry). It is remarkable, however, that with perhaps only a single exception, these musicians are not from the areas with which they stylistically associate themselves or even from Ireland itself. Rather, they are for the most part natives of Southeastern Wisconsin who have been introduced to Irish traditional music in the context of late 20 th century revival movements. How then have they come to associate themselves with localized performance styles from Ireland? This thesis analyzes these stylistic associations in terms of the repertory requirements of local dancing, opportunities to hear and be educated in regional styles by visiting musicians, and the availability of stylistically diverse audio recordings. This paper speaks to the ways in which local musics are globalized, but then socially re-localized through affinity-based musical practices, and is based on my extended local involvement as a musician from 2004 onwards, as well as ethnographic fieldwork from 2009 to 2010.",Milwaukee,-87.9064736,43.0389025,2

Drawing from cultural representations and interviews I conducted with fifty-one women in rural South Dakota and Minnesota, I suggest that an estrangement exists between the desires, logics, and strategies of LGBTQ women in the rural Midwest and those of gay rights movements. This estrangement points to the need to consider the ideologies undergirding and the ramifications of LGBTQ visibility politics. I make three interventions in the interdisciplinary study of visibility: I argue that calls for visibility are symptomatic of and enable metronormativity, that visibility politics reproduce both post-racial and what I term post-spatial ideologies, and, finally, that becoming recognizable as visible is a labored process, and, as such, calls for LGBTQ visibility, which relentlessly demand constant laboring, are a reflection of and benefit to capitalist logics. In doing so, I revise assumptions about the ostensible relations among gay community, identity, and visibility, question the notion that visibility leads to rights or justice, and challenge dominant conceptions of the nature of rural communities. Beyond examining the unbecoming-ness of visibility discourses, I suggest that an interrogation of visibility discourses explicates how one becomes (and might un-become) a sexual subject and can broaden possibilities for actualizing alternate subjectivities--sexual or otherwise.",Minnesota,-94.6858998,46.729553,2

I highlight three variable dimensions that help us understand the unique nature of social movements in abeyance: fields of contention, collective identity, and tactical repertoires. I argue that during periods in which mobilized participants have little support: a) institutions of higher education provide welcome environments for feminist mobilization, often in unexpected locations such as multi-cultural sororities and student government; b) feminist collective identities nest or ""spill over"" to influence other social movements including queer, anti-racist, and anti-fee hike organizations; and c) tactics move on-line, especially to social networking sites.

This is significant due to possible applications to understanding the spectrum of dilatations for a surface.

These organic paints are often present as part of complex mixtures within thin layers, well below the spatial resolution of many instruments. We also report the first high resolution spectroscopy of chromophores within madder dye, an historically significant organic colorant, allowing for the unambiguous identification of the molecule within the intrinsically complex nature of ancient paintings. Additionally, pottery sherds from Maya vessels (600-900 CE) and Mississippian vessels (1100-1200 CE) were examined for three molecular markers (theobromine, theophylline and caffeine) using R2PI spectroscopic techniques. The data obtained supports the existence of a previously unknown trade network between Mesoamerican and North American civilizations. A system combining laser desorption, jet-cooling, resonant 2-photon ionization (R2PI) spectroscopy, and time-of-flight mass spectrometry (TOF-MS) generates exceptionally well resolved vibronic spectroscopy and fragment free mass spectrometry for molecules within a complex matrix. Following laser desorption, gas-phase molecules are entrained in a supersonic molecular beam of argon. This causes extremely efficient jet-cooling of the internal degrees of freedom within the molecules and makes it possible to perform high resolution spectroscopy. The cold molecule is resonantly excited to the first electronic excited state by a tunable dye laser, and subsequently ionized by another photon before being detected in the TOF-MS. The result is the ability to selectively ionize a single target molecule within an extremely complex matrix.",Mississippi,-89.3985283,32.3546679,5

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Alexander R. Simms,"Recent studies along the northwestern Gulf of Mexico document rapid back-stepping of estuarine environments of up to 20 km and 150 m/yr at ca. 8.2 thousand years ago (ka), 4.8, ka, and 2.6 ka. If such rapid changes in coastal environments occurred today along the urbanized coast of the Gulf of Mexico major economical and ecological loss would occur. Of these three backstepping events, only one can be tied to a known cause---the 8.2 ka event related to a rapid increase in the rate of relative sea-level rise. However, the cause of the latter two, the 4.8 and 2.6 ka events are largely unknown. To determine the relative roles of changes in sea level and climate in these two events, paleo sea-level (Chapter 2), climate (Chapter 3), and stratigraphic records (Chapter 4) are presented from upper Baffin Bay, Texas and neighboring playa Laguna Salada. As commonly used high-resolution sea-level indicators are absent from the southern Texas Coast, a new sea-level indicator is needed. I test the use of intertidal microbial mats in reconstructing Holocene sea levels from Baffin, Bay Texas (Chapter 2). The indicative range of microbial mats is +/-0.29 m, much less than the +/-2 m indicative range of typical sea-level indicators currently used along the semiarid Texas coast. The elevations of 22 buried radiocarbon-dated microbial mats plot within error of relative sea-level data derived from the central Texas coast for the past 5.0 ky indicating that microbial mats provide a robust proxy for paleo--sea levels along semiarid and arid coastlines. The high-resolution microbial mat relative sea-level record derived from the tectonically stable central Texas coast also provides a test of recently proposed Holocene Highstands based on emergent coastal deposits in Texas and Alabama. The microbial mat relative sea-level data, similar to relative sea-level data derived from Mississippi Delta basal peats and lower-resolution Texas estuarine bivalves, indicates an ever-decreasing rate of relative sea-level rise since ca. 5.0 ka and precludes the possibility of Holocene Highstands in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Paleoclimate records are also sparse along the southern Texas coast. A new quantitative drought proxy is derived from a transfer function between X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) elemental data from a Texas playa and a tree-ring drought record (Chapter 3). Using this transfer function, a 954-year tree-ring drought record was extended to ca. 3,000 ka. Ba, Br, and Pb were utilized as predictor variables. Machine learning algorithms, utilized to derive the transfer function, had maximum validation accuracies of 94%. Changes in the extended drought record correspond with the timing of the Roman Climate Optimum, Medieval Warm Period, Little Ice Age, and changes in North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SST). Increased drought frequency is coeval with nearby dune migration ca. 0.2 ka, 1.9 ka, and 2.6 ka. The highest drought frequency in the record occurs during the Medieval Warm Period ca. 1.0 ka followed by a decrease in drought frequency during the Little Ice Age ca. 0.4 ka. Increased drought frequency accompanies increased North Atlantic SST since 3 ka. This trend of warm North Atlantic SST and dry conditions over the study area follows secular meteorological observations and tree-ring records. These results indicate that lacustrine derived XRF element data can be used as a quantitative tool to reconstruct past drought records, and that North Atlantic SST modulated drought in southern Texas for the last 3,000 years. Within Baffin Bay, five flooding surfaces making periods of abrupt environmental change, between 1.1--1.0 ka, 2.7--2.1 ka, 3.8--3.0 ka, 5.2--4.9 ka, and 6.5--5.7 ka occur through a time-period of ever decreasing rates of relative sea-level rise and within error of periods of drying in southern Texas at ca. 1.0 ka, 2.6 ka, 3.4 ka, 4.8 ka, and 5.5 ka (Chapter 4). I hypothesize that these flooding surfaces, occurring when sea level in the Gulf of Mexico was rising < 2 mm/yr, and during independently documented drying events, were primarily driven by changes in climate through declines in fluvial sediment supply to the coast.",Mississippi,-89.3985283,32.3546679,5

Kern County and the city of Bakersfield were critical epicenters of civil rights activism during the twentieth century. Simultaneously, an equally active and sometimes hostile, conservative resistance toward labor and civil rights existed in the region. In the immediate post-World War II era, Mexican Americans built racial coalitions with African Americans and white liberals to challenge racial segregation and discrimination in housing and employment. In the ensuing decades, the war on poverty, farmworker, and Chicana/o power movements impacted racial coalition building and civil rights reform in complex ways, including struggles over increased political representation for racial minorities, expansion of rural-migrant health care, and school desegregation. Since World War II through the rise of the modern political right, Mexican immigrants and their descendants shaped rural and urban civil rights reform in California's interior. This dissertation draws upon several archival repositories related to labor and civil rights history in California's Central Valley, including the collected papers of the United Farm Workers (UFW), the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF), the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Region I, West Coast Branch (NAACP-WC), the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), as well as previously unexamined personal paper collections of Bakersfield civil rights leaders and politicians.

Tourists from thirty-seven states flocked to view the town's decaying antebellum mansions, hoop-skirted hostesses, and a pageant saturated in sentimental Lost Cause imagery. Organized by the town's female garden club, the Pilgrimage created a popular culture experience that appealed to the tastes of 1930s tourists. All that was missing was Scarlett O'Hara herself. This dissertation analyzes how the selective white historical memories of a small Southern community originated from the experiences and hardships of the Civil War, changed over time, and culminated in a successful heritage tourism enterprise still in business today. This project also examines the ways in which Natchez African Americans worked to create a distinctive post-emancipation identity that challenged the dominant white historical memory. Although black public historical traditions in Natchez eroded far more quickly than in other Southern towns, this dissertation reveals how a vibrant postwar African American community helped to keep these memories alive. This dissertation builds on earlier scholarship in showing that historical memory is neither monolithic nor static, but an ongoing fluid process shaped and reshaped by memory makers, their audiences and an array of cultural, economic and political forces unique to a particular community. In the course of revealing how historical memory evolved in Natchez, this project contributes new insights on the periodization of Lost Cause ideology, the gendering of historical memory, and the role of fraternal and martial associations in crafting a postwar Southern masculine identity. The legacy of Natchez's collective historical memories---black and white---raises important questions about the impact of such selective historical memories on a nation and its people. Relying on a rich body of textual and visual sources, this study considers not only the meaning of being white and black in the late nineteenth and early twentieth-century Jim Crow South, but also the ways in which members of one black community crafted their own collective narratives of the past.",Mississippi,-89.3985283,32.3546679,5

History",History,Mario T. Garcia,"The history of race, politics, and civil rights in California's Central Valley is an important yet understudied aspect of multiracial history in the American West. Kern County and the city of Bakersfield were critical epicenters of civil rights activism during the twentieth century. Simultaneously, an equally active and sometimes hostile, conservative resistance toward labor and civil rights existed in the region. In the immediate post-World War II era, Mexican Americans built racial coalitions with African Americans and white liberals to challenge racial segregation and discrimination in housing and employment. In the ensuing decades, the war on poverty, farmworker, and Chicana/o power movements impacted racial coalition building and civil rights reform in complex ways, including struggles over increased political representation for racial minorities, expansion of rural-migrant health care, and school desegregation. Since World War II through the rise of the modern political right, Mexican immigrants and their descendants shaped rural and urban civil rights reform in California's interior. This dissertation draws upon several archival repositories related to labor and civil rights history in California's Central Valley, including the collected papers of the United Farm Workers (UFW), the Mexican American Legal Defense and Education Fund (MALDEF), the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People Region I, West Coast Branch (NAACP-WC), the Office of Economic Opportunity (OEO), as well as previously unexamined personal paper collections of Bakersfield civil rights leaders and politicians. Referred to pejoratively as ""Mississippi West"", given the county's vibrant history of civil rights activism and antistatist opposition toward civil rights, Kern County is ground-zero for a massive demographic transformation from a white to Hispanic majority; a trend other U.S. regions will experience in the coming decades. The history of race relations, civil rights, and politics in the region sheds light on the importance of a burgeoning Latino population, as well as marks a bellwether for future U.S. social and political trends in California and beyond.",Mississippi,-89.3985283,32.3546679,5

Videos capture police-citizen interactions and analysis focused on bystander participation during the street encounter. Videos were analyzed using methods of analytic induction and visual coding schemes. Findings show that bystanders use taunting and insulting the police as a form of resistance. Additionally, bystanders give advice to the subject of the encounter. Furthermore, bystander comments reveal the ways they believe gender and race to be relevant to the police-citizen encounter and relationship with law enforcement more generally. Bystander talk reframes the encounter and positions the subject as victim and law enforcement as the source of trouble. Bystanders accuse the police of going beyond the parameters of their jobs to express sexual desire and racial antipathy. Additionally, bystander participation dramatizes the limits of police authority as bystanders offer the subject legal advice and creates derogatory experiences for the police.",Missouri,-91.8318334,37.9642529,1

Geography",Geography,Bodo Bookhagen,"High Mountain Asia (HMA) has been strongly impacted by climate change, and will continue to be impacted by diverse climate stressors in the coming years. A combination of changing weather patterns and retreating glaciers has begun to impact water resources in the region; the rate, extent, and mechanisms behind these changes are poorly quantified due to a lack of data and process understanding. As rivers sourced in HMA feed more than a billion people in the region, increased understanding of climate impacts on regional hydrology is essential for effective water management. Glaciers play a diverse role in hydrology throughout the range, with some catchments having little to no reliance on glacial meltwater, and some catchments receiving almost all of their water from glaciers. This study aims to decipher the impact of climate change on glaciers in the Tien Shan mountain range, a large and understudied region that extends roughly 2,800 km northeast from the Pamir Knot in Tajikistan through China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Mongolia towards the Altai Mountains. As glacial area extents do not present a complete picture of the impacts of climate change on glaciers, the author undertook a pilot study to examine the mass balances of glaciers throughout the range. Mass balance estimates are a proxy for changes in water equivalent stored in a glacier, and are thus essential measurements for understanding the hydrology of the range. The author presents preliminary evidence that high elevation areas in the Tien Shan are thickening, even in the context of retreating glacial tongues. This implies an overall gain of ice mass in the region, despite generally retreating glaciers. This trend was linked to recent increases in precipitation in the range, as well as increases in air temperature. There is not yet enough data to unravel changes in glacier mass balance across the range, although the author predicts that the recently coined 'Karakoram Anomaly' may in fact need to be renamed to include both the Pamir and the western Tien Shan. After validating the algorithm against multiple manually digitized control datasets, the author applied it to a study area encompassing six Landsat scene footprints along the strike of the Tien Shan Orogen. A statistically significant, though minor, gradient in glacier retreat was found, where those glaciers in the west of the range have retreated less than those glaciers in the east. This gradient is explained by differences in regional climate, where large winter storms tend to arrive from the west and break apart and weaken before moving towards the eastern edge of the range. This is substantiated by differences in mean annual precipitation, as derived from Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) 3B43 V7 data, as well as differences in atmospheric lapse rates, where the western region of the range remains cold year-round and the more eastern edges have larger annual temperature fluctuations, as well as a lower overall lapse rate, which implies higher temperatures at higher elevations. Previous studies in the region lack the data to decipher gradients in glacial retreat across the range. To address this data deficit, the author designed and implemented a glacial mapping algorithm which delineates both clean glacial ice---methods which are well documented---and glacial debris tongues, which often require extensive manual digitization. This research is the most significant part of the thesis, and improves upon methods developed to automatically delineate glacial areas using spectral, topographic, velocity, and spatial relationships. The author found that the algorithm misclassifies between 2 and 10% of glacial areas, compared to a ~700 glacier control dataset. These results show significant improvement over previously used methods, as well as large-scale glacier databases such as the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI) which are commonly used in mountain-belt scale studies of glaciers.",Mongolia,103.846656,46.862496,2

Linguistics",Linguistics,Carol Genetti,"The most fundamental feature of Khatso is the fact that it is a pragmatics-based language, meaning that verbal semantics and discourse context are often more crucial than syntax in comprehending the language. Topic-comment structures and zero anaphora are frequent, regularly creating utterances in which key information is underspecified or absent. Some constructions, such as pragmatic agent marking, are triggered only when the context is ambiguous. And, many particles and constructions in Khatso are multifunctional, relying on context to clarify meaning. Essentially, syntax sets the stage for several potential interpretations and only the flow of information in a specific utterance points to the correct choice. Moreover, some constructions are only identifiable through contextual analysis, such as the many clause-combining structures that link phrases pragmatically without syntactic integration. Consequently, the discourse-functional approach used here has proven especially useful for painting a comprehensive picture of the Khatso language. The research and analysis presented in this dissertation differ significantly from previous efforts to describe the language. In addition to identifying the basic building blocks - phonetics, phonology, morphology, syntax and the lexicon - there is an emphasis on capturing Khatso the way it is spoken in daily life. Natural language data were gathered during nearly a year of fieldwork in Xingmeng, via both audio and video recordings, creating a large multimedia corpus of the language. Transcriptions of the recordings formed the foundation for the investigation, which follows a discourse-functional approach to linguistic analysis. As a result, this grammar is the most comprehensive analysis of Khatso yet, providing an in-depth look at the features, structures and systems that interact to comprise this unique language. It is also the first major study of the language in English. Khatso (kha55tso31 [special characters omitted]; also Katso, Kazhuo [special characters omitted], Gazhuo [special characters omitted] and Yunnan Mongolian; ISO 639-3:kaf) is an endangered Ngwi (or Yi) language spoken in Xingmeng, a single farming village in Yunnan, China. Khatso speakers, who number about 5600 people, are descendants of the Mongolian soldiers Kublai Khan brought to Yunnan in the 13th century, and they still identify as Mongolian today. The language has evolved considerably through language contact, however, and is now considered part of the central branch of the Ngwi language family within the Tibeto-Burman phylum. Khatso is a tonal language that is both analytic and isolating. The phonology is similar to that of most Ngwi languages, with the exception of its relatively large eight-tone system. Tone sandhi is triggered by a variety of phonological, syntactic and discourse factors. There is very little morphology in the language, and most of the lexicon consists of monosyllabic and disyllabic monomorphemes. There is a rich classifier system, which also marks number and specific reference. Typical word order is SV/APV, though there is a great deal of flexibility in discourse. Simple noun modifiers follow nouns, but relative clauses precede them. Serial verb constructions are frequent, and may describe one- and two-event situations. There is no verbal inflection; the aspectual system is indicated by grammatical particles. There is also no evidential system, but both the interrogative and emphatic marker inventories include morphemes that convey epistemic information. Almost all of the Khatso are bilingual in Mandarin or the local Yunnan dialect, because that is the only way to communicate with outsiders. Chinese is also the only language used in school and mastering it is necessary to pursue an education or find employment outside the town. Children continue to learn the language, but many parents teach them Chinese first and Khatso second. Moreover, there is no writing system; the language is not supported by print media or technology. As a result, the vitality of the language is eroding rapidly. This dissertation is part of larger project to document Khatso in order to help preserve and revitalize the language.",Mongolia,103.846656,46.862496,2

Even a relatively small amount of Carpobrotus edulis has negative effects on arthropod abundance, richness, and composition, with an exponential decrease in abundance and richness and a shift in composition well before 50% Carpobrotus cover. Changes in feeding guilds and composition helped to suggest the drivers of these patterns, and revealed a particularly strong effect on fossorial arthropods, likely related to the dense rooting structure of Carpobrotus. Thus, while the negative effects of non-native plant invasions typically increase with increasing invader cover, the form of this relationship is determined by the attributes of both the invader and the invaded system. For my dissertation work, I asked what effect non-native plant invasions are having on entire arthropod assemblages, and how that effect is related to the degree of invasion. I further asked how the responses by component feeding guilds contribute to these relationships. I answered these questions by conducting a meta-analysis and review of existing studies, then investigating the effects of one invader, Carpobrotus edulis, on coastal dune arthropods at four different coastal California sites.

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Jordan F. Clark,"California guidelines for recycled water reuse currently give preference to groundwater tracers to determine underground retention time, with a target retention time of >6 months from infiltration to drinking water extraction. Two prospective tracers were evaluated here: boron-10 (10B, the lesser abundant boron stable isotope), and heat (with recharging water warmed at sewage treatment plants and by solar radiation in surface-spreading basins). Bromide (Br-), a conservative deliberate salt tracer with limitations to low-volume settings, was released as a control. Tracer injection occurred when 3 kg of 10B-enriched boric acid and 36 kg of NaBr were added to the research test basin at San Gabriel Spreading Grounds, part of the Montebello Forebay, Los Angeles County, CA, USA. Recycled wastewater was piped directly to this basin at a rate of 2200 m3/day for ~two continuous months. 10B and Br- tracer breakthroughs were observed at seven monitoring wells ranging from directly beneath the basin floor to 150 m downgradient. Travel times ranged from 0.7 to 40 days. Arrival of Br- to each well was always coincident or preceded 10B arrival, reflecting retardation of 10B presumably due to exchange with clay surfaces. 10B/Br - travel time ratios determined from the center of mass ranged from 1 to 1.4. Travel times were successfully determined to all wells. Peak matching of diurnal variations was only possible at the nearest well (<1 day travel time). Basic analysis of temperature measurements, even in the absence of peak matching, yielded a reliable estimate of the underground residence time. Heat has great potential as an intrinsic tracer for managed recharge applications. Based on average tracer travel times, a vertical flow line directly below the test basin had an average vertical velocity of 3.3 m/day, equivalent to a recharge rate of 0.8 m/day.",Montebello,-118.1137535,34.0165053,1

Spanish and Portuguese",Spanish and Portuguese,Ellen McCracken,"To date, no lengthy study has examined queer sexualities and space in Latin American film. In three chapters organized around different spatial scales, I theorize how spatiality reflects and affects the development and expression of queer sexuality in eight films from throughout Latin America. In the first chapter, I explore public and private spaces in relation to queer sexuality in Francisco J. Lombardi's No se lo digas a nadie (Peru 1998), Tomas Gutierrez Alea and Juan Carlos Tabio's Fresa y chocolate (Cuba 1993), and Jorge Fons's El callejon de los milagros (Mexico 1994). I argue that despite their attempts to carve out private spaces---with varying degrees of success---the queer characters in these films are not able to escape the influence of the public sphere and heteronormativity. In Chapter Two, I examine the relationship between queer sexualities and city space. I argue that in Enrique Bochichio's El cuarto de Leo (Uruguay 2009) Montevideo is presented as a sort of utopia, a liberating space for individuals who may choose to come out of the closet. By conflating homosexuality with criminality, Marcelo Pineyro's Plata quemada (Argentina 2000), on the other hand, depicts the traditionally oppressive, unsustainable relationship between the city and homosexuals. In Chapter Three, I explore the use of the body as a space for working through issues of queer sexuality. In the films that I analyze, there is an increasing degree of materialization of the body as space. In Javier Fuentes-Leon's Contracorriente (Peru 2009), the ghost of the protagonist's dead lover serves as a sort of mirror that helps the protagonist cope with his sexuality. In Karim Ainouz's Madame Sata (Brazil 2002), issues of sexual identity, gender, race, and class are consolidated in the body of a cross-dressing performer. In Lucia Puenzo's XXY (Argentina 2007), the concern for the body as space is materialized to the greatest extent. The protagonist is an intersexed adolescent whose body serves as a space that represents not only her internal struggles, but also those of her parents and the society within which she does not neatly fit.",Montevideo,-56.1645314,-34.9011127,1

Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology","Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology",Gretchen E. Hofmann,"Ocean acidification (OA) and rising sea surface temperatures will likely shape the structure and function of coral reefs in the future (Fig. 1). Understanding the sensitivity of corals to ongoing shifts in pCO2 and temperature is imperative as coral are the engineers of the coral reef ecosystem. Specifically, coral larvae may be a life history stage of corals that is particularly vulnerable to environmental stress. Shifts in physiological processes in response to environmental conditions may affect the success of larval dispersal and recruitment. To understand the consequences of OA and warming on the physiology of P. damicornis larvae, I employed a holistic approach, examining the response of a suite of physiological processes from the levels of gene expression up to the level of the whole organism. I used metabolic rate and lipid utilization as whole-organism techniques for assessing the effects of OA and warming on larval energy consumption. Planulae released after the peak of spawning experienced metabolic suppression under high-temperature, high-pCO2 conditions. There was evidence of biochemical limits of increasing oxidative capacity to satisfy elevated energy demands under future ocean conditions. Measurements of lipid utilization suggested that the metabolic costs of tolerating OA and warming will be greatest when both environmental stressors occur simultaneously. Larvae released at the peak of spawning will experience greatest changes in lipid content in response to OA and warming, with associated changes in buoyancy that affect their dispersal potential. The organism-level studies revealed physiological plasticity within coral larval energy consumption. Biochemical and transcriptomic techniques were used to better understand the underlying mechanisms. P. damicornis larvae increased their total antioxidant potential in response to oxidative stress under exposures to high pCO2 but not elevated temperature. Furthermore, OA-induced hypercapnia caused increased acid-base regulation, observed through elevated pNPPase activity of Na+/K +-ATPase. As was observed at the whole-organism level, physiological traits varied between cohorts of larvae. Finally, comparisons of gene expression profiles revealed down-regulation of genes under single-stressor treatments but up-regulation of genes when high-pCO2 and high-temperature co-occurred. An important facet of my dissertation research was to provide environmental context for the results of my biological experiments. I deployed autonomous pH and temperature sensors on the fringing reefs where the experimental corals were collected. The time series of pH and temperature approximated the conditions of the water mass bathing the reef to which the study organisms were acclimatized and into which the larvae would have been released. These environmental data confirmed that control treatments in the laboratory experiments were within the range of conditions experienced on the reef. The elevated pCO2 treatment levels were not observed in the present-day time series. Additionally, pH and temperature regimes differed between reefs in Moorea and Taiwan. pH and temperature were on average lower in Taiwan and more variable in Moorea. Temperature was on average lower and more variable in Taiwan. These results highlight the importance of generating such an environmental context for study species. Environmental data informed metrics of biological performance of individuals at these sites as well as the potential heterogeneity of phenotypes across the biogeographic species range, products of local adaptation to regimes of pH and temperature. The aim of this dissertation was to examine the physiological plasticity of coral larvae in response to two potentially interacting anthropogenic stressors -- OA and warming. Pocillopora damicornis (Linnaeus, 1758) was an excellent study organism for this research given its ubiquitous Indo-Pacific distribution, reef-building role, and long dispersal potential. To accomplish the objectives of this dissertation, I conducted laboratory experiments in which P. damicornis larvae were exposed to seawater of different pCO2 and temperature conditions. P. damicornis larvae were collected from populations in Moorea, French Polynesia and southern Taiwan.",Moorea,-149.8295234,-17.5388435,1

English",English,Bishnupriya Ghosh,"This dissertation presents a series of studies in the aesthetics of vital matter, examining their trans-corporeality in a range of cultural artifacts produced by what Nikolas Rose has come to call the ""molecularization of vitality"" (13). In The Politics of Life Itself, Rose discusses molecularity as a mode or practice, a way of imagining a new vitality and permeability between bodies that now is open to aesthetic-political analysis. This vitality, Rose argues, is related to the new mobility of vital elements, the ways in which ""Molecularization strips tissues, proteins, molecules and drugs of their specific affinities... and enables them to be regarded, in many respects, as manipulable, and transferable elements or units, which can be delocalized---moved from place to place, from organism to organism, from disease to disease, from person to person (15). Rose suggests molecularity as a style of thought, a new intelligibility and transparency about the compositional makeup of bodies. Molecularization became not just a style of thought, but also a technique of optimization and enhancement (15), a technique which refuted the reductionism and oversimplifying of dynamic biological systems. Together, these theoretical explorations of the molecule suggest its power lays in its unprecedented specificity, one that has peaked the interests of scholars from biopolitics to aesthetics. Molecules are data, but they also are complex arrangements with behaviors, shapes, and forms. What occurs when we take on a ""molecular"" gaze is an even-ing of playing fields in a sense. Scientific advances in molecular technologies have produced a molecular imaginary that involves new modes of perceiving between things. As a kinesthetic paradigm, molecular modes of perceiving or sensing which emerge from modern molecular biology have altered the framework for a certain vitalist aesthetic. Research within systems and synthetic biology signal a new future of vital states, constantly being regulated, reorganized, and most importantly, customized for consumption. This aesthetic is both uncertain and non-human, an exploration of how agency manifests at a wide variety of scales and between a wide variety of objects. The texts examined in the dissertation belong to no exclusive pre-established literary moment though most are taken from Anglo-American culture in the modernist moment into the 21st century. They are gathered to consider how molecularity produces different disciplinary domains, particularly since New Materialist critique has increasingly called upon scholarship to provide a more associative landscape for not just analyzing material bodies, but also mobilizing them. What, then, does cancer, J.G. Ballard's psychotropic houses, xray crystallography, the electric chair, transgenic mice, poetry about reproductive technologies, Leopold Bloom's dromomania, Bertha's bliss, protocell technology, and systems architecture have to do with each other? The intervention of the dissertation is not so much the theoretical framework by itself, but that the theoretical framework demands a reorganization of how we mobilize a range of cultural artifacts through a transversal mode of molecular thinking. As either agents, texts, or states of matter, these eco-materialist texts that all problematize the natural/culture divide as well as challenge our notions of species, subjectivity, and body-making. Moreover, they tread on the affective space of an uncertain vitalism. It is not as if now we live in the molecular age, as in, we are living in a new age where everything is customizable, transparent, ready to be turned into scientific data and quantified. It is this for sure, but this is nothing new, in fact, we are arguably at the ""peak"" of the molecular age and biopolitics in contemporary discourse. Instead, the provocation of the molecular age lies in that it marks the age of the indiscernible subject, the indiscernible organism, the indiscernible feeling, the indiscernible machine, the uncertain vitality lingering off the shoots of a downed wire during Hurricane Sandy, the poem-turned-karyotype of an unborn baby, the DNA-less oil that sheds skin for landscaping properties in systems architecture. These are uncertain vitalities. They experiment with matter that differentiates, morphs, and perhaps has sentience, homeostasis, movement, behavior, etc. What's more, and this is a discussion largely missing from new materialist criticism on scientific matter, they have aesthetic histories. From William Morris' treatises on the organic ornamental to Democritus' theories on atomism, the dissertation offers arguments to motivate further research on aesthetic histories of new vitalities highlighted by scientific discoveries. The organizing questions for the dissertation ask how does molecular thinking activate perceptions of vital matter, how are then those perceptions realized in molecular aesthetics, and lastly, what do these molecular aesthetics tell us about key questions of agency that haunt vitalist debates?",Morris,-74.5463282,40.8336038,2

Music",Music,Derek Katz,"Focusing on the period from roughly 1870 until the start of the Second World War, this dissertation provides a reappraisal of the formative decades of the early music revival, as well as a reassessment of its position within the larger cultural landscape of the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. In situating the revival within this context, my project seeks to illuminate its rich connections with the artistic, literary, and intellectual developments of the time. By reframing the discussion along these lines, I wish to show that far from being an isolated retreat into the musical past, the revival of early music was in fact an integral and vital element of modern culture, closely connected to many of the progressive artistic and intellectual movements active in the decades surrounding the turn of the 20th century. After an introductory chapter that provides an overview of my topic, I proceed to a study on the evolving reception of the harpsichord in the 19th and early 20th centuries, using the instrument as an entry point for the examination of the tensions between the past and present. The third chapter focuses on two case studies: Gustav Mahler's 1909 ""Bach Suite"" and Fritz Kreisler's ""Classical Manuscripts."" The former work repackaged Bach for modern audiences, while simultaneously emphasizing the historical nature of the music. By contrast, the Kreisler works presented newly composed music as being the products of long-dead historical composers like Louis Couperin, Antonio Vivaldi, and Gaetano Pugnani. In discussing these works I look at how both Mahler and Kreisler shrewdly balanced perceived historicity with a desire for familiar appeal. The fourth chapter provides a detailed study of Arnold Dolmetsch's engagement with the Arts and Crafts movement around turn of the 20th century, particularly his relationship with William Morris and the creation of the ""Green Harpsichord."" In my final chapter, I look at the role that recording technology played in both promoting in shaping the sound of early music in the 1920s and 1930s.",Morris,-74.5463282,40.8336038,2

Geography",Geography,Michael F. Goodchild,"Geographically embedded networks (GENets) are systems of physical and abstract linked relationships contained wholly or partially within geographic space. The purpose of this dissertation is to examine the question, ""what are the particular characteristics of networks in geography?"" To uncover such properties, a series of network case studies is examined and each translated into computational data structures or workflows. Constrained as computational models, the cases are assessed and compared for patterns and common approaches. The modeling serves, 1) as a methodological template for the discovery of network properties, and 2) to reveal an initial set of characteristics for consideration based on the contemporary state of quantitative geographical analysis. The use cases are examined first by focusing on data structures and second through analytical workflows. The data structure use cases were selected to represent diverse GENet conditions and include Minard's map of Napoleon's March on Moscow, a Census table of state-to-state human migration, and a GIS dataset of the flow routes in Kentucky's Mammoth Cave karst watershed. The analytical workflow use cases include an optimization problem (shortest path calculation), a process model (stream network generation from an elevation model), a simulation (growth along an urban corridor), and a GIS feature comparison (selection of streets bounding a city block). Commonalities from the data structure cases are distilled into a general model, but the analytical cases cannot be similarly reconciled. In order to make the geographic aspects of the analytical cases explicit, the cases are evaluated against a set of tests for spatial models devised by Goodchild (2012). From the case studies and tests, GENet characteristics can be subdivided into two categories: those that are properties of network with respect to the physical environment and those that are properties of representation. GENets with arcs or nodes that physically exist in the environment may exhibit characteristics of constituent heterogeneity and areal interaction. GENets representations are affected by issues of scale and spatial uncertainty. To evaluate these characteristics in a GIS implementation, an itinerary planning GENet problem, the Geyser Travel Problem, is introduced. The problem offers a practical application of GENet workflows in GIS and an avenue for discussion of associated best practices.",Moscow,37.6172999,55.755826,1

Sociology",Sociology,Denise A. Segura,"This ethnographic study examined the way the University Industrial Complex creates an informal economy. This study interrogated how the lines between the formal and informal sector are increasingly becoming blurred as both economic systems require a powerful workforce (consisting of faculty, administrators, graduate students, undergraduate students, etc.) whose social reproduction is secured by a powerless army of service workers who live and work in the shadows of the university, that is, in college-towns such as Mountain View. The following methodologies were utilized: ethnography, semi-structured and face-to-face interviews, shadowing, and police ride-a-longs. The findings revealed that an informal economy is internally stratified in what I call a dual-informal economy between powerful students and powerless non-students (Latina/o immigrants, gangs, and alumni). Mountain View's informal economy is not an equal playing field, but it involves a major component of social control, which keep an army of informal laborers in their place through selective criminalization, that is, criminalization of classed and racialized communities who are victimized. In this case, the state especially in the form of the police and other social control agencies criminalize the informal economic activities of the powerless and tends to ignore those of the powerful and privileged sectors. As a consequence, the powerless developed creative responses at the level of their individual and collective agency in order to challenge hyper-criminalization and hyper-surveillance by being covert about their income generating practices. Finally, this ethnography suggests we must refine existing theories in the informal economy.",Mountain View,-122.0838511,37.3860517,1

Global and International Studies",Global and International Studies,Jan Nederveen Pieterse,"In 2009 the governments of Brazil, Japan, and Mozambique agreed to launch a long-term agricultural development program along the Nacala Corridor in Northern Mozambique. The aim of the program known as ProSAVANA is to replicate the successes of the transformation which took place in the Cerrado region of Brazil beginning in the 1970s, helping that country to become a major global producer of several agricultural commodities. The governments in charge of the program have promised poverty alleviation and food security for Mozambican farmers through investment in agricultural research and extension services, increased land tenure security, improved irrigation, roads, and storage facilities, and greater access to modern inputs and markets through contract agriculture. However, since its early stages the program has faced intense opposition from small-scale farmers, peasant organizations, and national and international NGOs. There is great fear that the program will result in massive land expropriation benefiting corrupt politicians and foreign companies at the expense of the families farming in the region. These groups point to the massive concentration of land ownership and the environmental destruction that accompanied the transformation to large-scale mechanized agriculture in the Brazilian Cerrado. They also cite the large number of land conflicts in recent years between local small-scale farmers and foreign investors granted land concessions by the government. The large majority of Northern Mozambique's population practices rain-fed subsistence agriculture with little or no access to chemical fertilizers, pesticides, or improved seed varieties. More than 40 percent of farmers fail to produce enough crops to feed themselves for the entire year. Very few people in the region have land title and thus are in a precarious position. There is little doubt that increased investment in the region could contribute to higher crop yields and greater food production. However, it is also possible that more investment may also lead to an increase in the number of land conflicts and expropriation of peasant lands. In my thesis I will trace out the development of ProSAVANA and analyze some of the historical circumstances that may have contributed to the strong negative reaction against the program. I will review the Mozambican land tenure system and threats to the land tenure security of Mozambican peasants. I will look at the ways in which the opposition to ProSAVANA has led to changes in the rhetoric used in program documents, and possible changes to the priorities of the program itself. Finally, I will ask under what conditions the program may gain the acceptance of the peasant population and be considered a success.",Mozambique,35.5296,-18.6657,1

Anthropology",Anthropology,Juan Vicente Palerm,"California provides a unique opportunity to investigate how capitalist agriculture shapes the development of different societies. The types of agricultural workers and communities that can or are found in association with agricultural crops in California vary according to historical specificity, location and commodity produced. Production and consumption are closely linked. This linkage between consumption and production is evident in the rapid increase in the production of wine grapes across California as the consumption of wine increases globally. In the Napa Valley, the capital investment in the wine industry is changing the organization of wine grape agriculture and its relationship to labor. I investigate the role of terroir-tourism by examining the interconnection of various sectors of labor: vineyard labor, wine production, and tasting rooms. I argue that wine grape cultivation is a significant factor in shaping both physical and social spaces, society, people and landscapes in the Napa Valley. This dissertation argues that the intensified production (more labor intensive) in premium wine grapes is facilitating the permanent settlement of Mexican farm laborers in the Napa Valley. Through the use of ethnographic accounts this dissertation interrogates the meaning of social interaction in specific spaces between Mexican farm laborers and white actors. This dissertation is theoretically driven by space and examines how power, language, class, race, and knowledge interact in a social setting where the parameters are tightly scripted.

Geography, Joint Program SDSU","Geography, Joint Program SDSU","David Lopez-Carr, Li An","This dissertation addresses connections among climate variability and change, land use and land cover, and population at a rural case study site in the Chitwan Valley in south-central Nepal experiencing rapid population growth and change. Subsistence farmers drawn to the area since the beginning of settlement in the 1960's are the primary residents, many of whom in-migrated to Chitwan for the increased agricultural opportunities available in the valley compared to more rural areas of Nepal. However, the dependence of the population on rainfed and seasonally irrigated agriculture leads to a vulnerability to environmental change. This study begins with an analysis of climate trends in the area, finding increasing interannual precipitation variability, increasing minimum temperatures, and reduced dry season streamflow, all likely to have adverse effects on agricultural yields in the region. Using satellite and social survey data from the Chitwan Valley Family Study, a regression model reveals links between agricultural productivity and short-distance temporary migration in the valley. Finally, to integrate findings from multilevel studies of social and environmental change in the region, an agent-based model is developed, and used to examine the effect of reciprocal connections (feedbacks) between demographic change and land use. The model reveals that feedbacks between environmental change and individual-level demographic decisions can lead to significant differences in rates of population growth and land-use change. The study reveals the strong couplings between environmental change, individual-level decisions, and livelihoods in Chitwan, and suggests that managers must take a holistic, landscape-level view when setting conservation policy.",Nepal,84.124008,28.394857,2

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Douglas W. Burbank,"The Himalayas are a surface manifestation of the ongoing collision of the Indian and Asian plates. As stress accumulates along the collision zone, it is released during large earthquakes that pose an enormous threat to the growing populations in the region. The destructive power of these earthquakes was demonstrated most recently by the 2015 Gorkha earthquake in central Nepal, which caused over ten thousand casualties. Most large Himalayan earthquakes occur along the Main Himalayan Thrust (MHT), which is the active plate boundary beneath the range. In addition to generating large earthquakes, tectonic movement along the MHT results in mountain building. Recent theoretical and technical advances have led to the realization that rates of rock uplift, which reflect the structure of the faults in the subsurface, are, to a degree, encoded into the landscape form (i.e., tectonics can be read from topography). Analysis of Himalayan topography reveals that the mountain front in western Nepal is characterized by two steps, as opposed to the rest of the central Himalaya, which features a single, dramatic mountain front. This distinction is likely related to a previously unknown along-strike change in the geometry and history of tectonic structures beneath the range. Specifically, it is hypothesized that mid-crustal deformation has recently shifted from the northern topographic step to the southern, raising a broad area between them that is now preserved as a high-elevation, low-relief landscape. In order to test the hypothesis that the study area in western Nepal is undergoing transient incision due to recent uplift of the low-relief landscape between the two mountain fronts, modern erosion rates are estimated in twelve watersheds that drain the two topographic steps and the high-elevation, low-relief landscape between them. Erosion rates vary by an order of magnitude and appear to be a function of watershed morphology, which is in turn a function of the watershed's position with respect to an upstream-migrating wave of incision that appears to be related to the hypothesized rejuvenated uplift along the southern mountain front. In a parallel study aimed at constraining the longer-term history of deformation in the study area, low-temperature thermochronology is employed to estimate rock-uplift rates from bedrock cooling ages. Inversion of these data using a thermo-kinematic model yields best-fit rock-uplift rates, which are compared to predictions from the hypothesis presented above. Results show that the main zone of rock uplift in well-studied central Nepal makes a sharp turn to follow the northern mountain front in western Nepal, away from the trend of the rest of the range, which would otherwise follow the southern mountain front. In contrast, rock uplift has been slow since ~10 Ma along the southern mountain front, and the hypothesized recent uplift there can be no older than 4 Ma. In summary, the recent tectonic history in western Nepal differs significantly from the trend exhibited in adjacent segments of the range. This distinction has important implications for the possible locations of future seismic activity, the paleoseismic record in western Nepal, and the ongoing evolution of the range.",Nepal,84.124008,28.394857,2

History of Art and Architecture",History of Art and Architecture,Mark Meadow,"In this dissertation I show how ties between Early Netherlandish painting and pageantry spectacles point to a distinct fifteenth-century conception of pictorial naturalism as figurative animation. In the fifteenth-century, painters were the primary designers of spectacles and the two media also shared patrons and a formal and critical vocabulary. Focusing on key artifacts and spectacles produced in the orbit of the influential Valois Burgundian ducal court between 1420 and 1478, I analyze the joint genesis, conception, and reception of painting and pageantry to argue that the proliferating interest in pictorial naturalism was driven by an ontological, rather than epistemological preoccupation. In Chapter I, ""Living Pictures,"" I focus on the Ghent Altarpiece and a 1420 Passion staging to retrace the Pygmalionesque-Promethean metaphor that governed the production and reception of Early Netherlandish painting. Drawing on period texts, I show that before 1550 the ubiquitous Middle French terms for pictorial naturalism apres le vif and au vif, regularly applied to both paintings and spectacles, denoted a painting brought to, rather than (as hitherto presumed) from, life. I then distinguish fifteenth-century conceptions of contact and verisimilitude from the modern concept of indexicality. Tying the animation metaphor to such discourses as medical alchemy, as well as to paradigmatic texts such as the Roman de la rose, I contextualize this trope within the broader period preoccupation with eschatology and agency. Chapter II, ""Painting Spectacle."" is concerned with painters' involvement in pageantry production. Analyzing accounting records---most closely a full set preserved from the 1468 Bruges wedding of Duke Charles the Bold with the English Princess Margaret of York---I establish that painters were the primary designers of stages, and, moreover, that patrons thought of stagecraft as painting. This medium indistinction evinces the somatic viewing experience encoded into imagery of both two- and three-dimensions in the fifteenth century, setting ontological equivalence as the inevitable conceptual horizon for naturalistic painting. In Chapter III, ""Making Histories,"" I trace connections between the 1478 theatricalized ducal baptism of Philip the Handsome in Bruges, contemporized paintings of sacred history, and ekphrastic historiography such as Christine de Pizan's 1403 Livre de la mutacion de fortune, to show that the epistemology of fifteenth-century imagery au vif was anchored in virtuous authorial agency rather than objectivity-connoting immediacy. Establishing that a preoccupation with the animation of the image, rather than any budding sensibility for immediacy or objectivity, shaped that crucial moment of resurging interest in pictorial naturalism, I decouple some of the first naturalistic easel paintings from the rise of the modern indexicality paradigm of naturalism. This dissertation thus effects a significant revision to the art-historical account of the transition from medieval to Renaissance painting.",Netherlands,5.291266,52.132633,3

Envisioning Change in the Seventeenth-Century Dutch Cityscape",2013,"Packer, Michelle Victoria","University of California, Santa Barbara. History of Art and Architecture",History of Art and Architecture,Ann Jensen Adams,"This dissertation argues that pictures of changes occurring in seventeenth-century Dutch cities---burning, demolition, construction, renovation and social change---activated collective memories that viewers used to craft their personal, professional, and political identities. Physical urban change, both intentional and unexpected, was ubiquitous in the seventeenth-century Netherlands, and its pace and extent so great that change itself became characteristic of Dutch urban life. The dissertation challenges the predominant scholarly opinion that cityscapes are foremost expressions of pride. Falling outside many of the subject matter conventions of cityscapes, images of change often depict areas that are dirty, in chaos, or that no longer exist. Such images were related by artists and viewers to past political and social events through quotations of visual precedents and accompanying textual interpretations. Part I of the dissertation studies the city dismantled by fire and demolition. Chapter 1 analyzes Jan van der Heyden's Fire Hose Book of 1690, arguing that Van der Heyden's fire imagery recalls the horrors of war, and then combines image and text to provide the reader with a means of participating in protecting the city from such threats. Chapter 2 examines images of demolished buildings that allowed the viewer to position himself as a social ""insider"" by claiming a personal relationship to memories of the pre-change urban landscape. Part II studies the city rebuilt by construction, renovation, and social change. Chapter 3 looks at images of urban growth and renovation and argues that these physical turning points in the city's development gave artists and viewers the opportunity to attach meaning to the economic and aesthetic consequences of growth. Chapter 4 examines images of social interactions in the city, arguing that a variety of relationships to urban ""others"" could be asserted, from a socially distant acceptance to a restatement of the status quo that mocked one's social inferiors. The final chapter proposes avenues for further research, including the expression of time in cityscape imagery.",Netherlands,5.291266,52.132633,3

Sociology",Sociology,Kum-Kum Bhavnani,"My doctoral dissertation examines how rising seas and a recently renewed interest in the construction of seawalls illustrate a form of development that involves substantial labor, financing, and materials in addition to hidden social and environmental costs. More generally, the research looks at the moving borders of the sea driven by the complex dynamics of anthropogenic climate change in which twenty-five million to one billion people will be affected by the year 2050. I draw upon theoretical approaches that consider climate-related issues to be macro-social processes involving global and international relations as well as matters of lived experience involving people in contexts where material and cultural histories shape climate change resiliency. Using the methods of global ethnography, I address the problem of coastal vulnerability by focusing on the cultural and social dynamics of coastal development and sea change in Guyana, The Maldives, Venice and the Netherlands, highlighting issues that emerge in places where seawalls are already important fixtures in the landscape. Analysis across these sites reveals how the threat of rising seas involves multiple axes of inequality formed within the contexts of colonialism, development, and globalization over the past one hundred years. Seawalls and other coastal structures embody culturally ingrained meanings, physical demands, and financial investments that continue to shape the experiences of those who live behind them. Data was gathered from April 2012 to April 2014 in Venice, the Netherlands, Guyana and the Maldives, and included sixty-two semi-structured interviews and nine focus groups, touching upon the lived experiences of 120 people. Findings illustrate the tensions and contradictions that ground seawall development. In Guyana, sand bags and rip-rap structures line the coast in contrast to the state of the art concrete barriers found in Venice, the Netherlands, and the United States. Poor coastal villages have few options as they invest time and hope in the restoration of mangroves forests, a process that has been met with many obstacles and unexpected sacrifices. In the Maldives, one-third of the population lives on a walled island without beaches, while tourists enjoy holidays on over two hundred island resorts nearby. As seawalls become measures of last resort in the struggle to hold the line, the existing narratives of the ""sinking island"" and ""climate change refugee"" fail to capture the dynamic inequalities that exist within and between places. This study shows the need to offer different conceptualizations of rising seas in public discourses, based on an analysis of seawalls and what the people who live in and around them say as they speak out.",Netherlands,5.291266,52.132633,3

Anthropology",Anthropology,Michael Glassow,"To reconstruct ceramic production and consumption pattern, laser-ablation inductively couple plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) was conducted on 1,069 sherds from the Mt. Trumbull/Tuweep and the lowland Virgin areas, along with source clay samples collected from the same areas. To examine how the use of clay resources changed over time, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating was conducted on 113 sherd samples with compositional information. Ultimately, the goal of this study is to understand why ceramic production and circulation patterns changed during the Ancestral Pueblo occupation of this peripheral area of the American Southwest. I hypothesize that ceramic production and regional interaction patterns were shaped in part by the need to minimize subsistence risk in this marginal agricultural environment. The data presented here suggest that different environmental conditions favored different social interaction and local ceramic production patterns. In Mt. Trumbull, under unstable climatic conditions and low population density, near the beginning of the Puebloan occupation, pots moved along with human migration. Later, when populations were higher and environmental conditions were equally unstable, pots were moved through interregional trade. In addition, clay resource specialization was favored early but was replaced later by exclusive use of optimal clays when population numbers were higher. In the lowland Virgin area, exchange played an important role as a risk minimization strategy throughout the Puebloan occupation, but clay-resource specialization gained importance later on, when populations increased. The Arizona Strip and adjacent areas in Utah and Nevada are in a very marginal environment. This dissertation investigates how small-scale farmers who survived more than 1000 years in this area coped with the challenges of this marginal environment by examining how and why social interaction patterns varied over time in different parts of the region. Artifact assemblages from this area that date between A.D. 200 and 1350 are characterized by widely distributed ceramics tempered with olivine, a volcanic mineral. Sources of olivine lie in the vicinity of Mt. Trumbull and Tuweep, near the northwestern part of the Grand Canyon. The olivine-tempered ceramics were distributed mostly westward from Mt.

I tested the hypothesis that differences in skin-associated bacterial communities (referred to simply as the microbiome for brevity) can account for differences in the outcome of R. sierrae infection, i.e. population extinction versus persistence. I surveyed microbiomes from multiple R. sierrae populations and showed that populations that persisted or declined to extinction due to Bd indeed harbored different skin bacterial communities, consistent with a protective effect of bacteria in persistent populations. At the same time I found evidence that Bd infection itself may drive variation in the microbiome, both at the local scale (among frogs within a given population), and landscape scale (among populations). Understanding why microbial communities vary among individuals or populations is an important step toward understanding the diversity and function of the microbiome. I present an experiment that tested the effects of natural variation in the aquatic environment and genetic variation among R. sierrae individuals in shaping the skin microbiome.",Nevada,-116.419389,38.8026097,16

Communication",Communication,Linda L. Putnam,"This paper traces a case study of advocacy tactics aimed at institutional change in the legal Nevada brothel industry. The brothel industry represents a unique case of legalized prostitution in the United States and the subject of debates about the institutional positioning of prostitution as an accepted service or an unaccepted vice. Specifically, the study considers the issues that give rise to institutional problems, the actors who advocate change, the audiences who can legitimate new organizational field arrangements, and the discursive tactics involved in entrepreneurial types of change. A single case study design that entails thematic and grounded theory qualitative techniques was applied to text data from newspaper articles. Analyses developed category schemes for each concept and theorized advocacy patterns in the case. The findings reveal that groups of actors use distinct sets of tactics to advocate pro and con sides in defining industry and prostitution problems. Confirming prior research, actors use institutional vocabularies to construct and position the problems. Findings also demonstrate how actors try to shift the field in relation to legitimate and illegitimate institutional arenas by locating the problem in the institutional field and creating urgency to act. Other patterns distinguish the institutional entrepreneurs from other advocates and identify the critical roles that certain audiences play in entrepreneurial processes. Such insights offer opportunities for continued theory building at the intersection of institutional theory and communication and speculations about potential change for the brothel industry and legalized prostitution.",Nevada,-116.419389,38.8026097,16

Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology","Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology",Cheryl J. Briggs,"Mountain yellow-legged frogs (Rana muscosa and Rana sierrae) of California's Sierra Nevada have been extirpated from over 90% of their historic range, initially by introduced trout predators, and more recently by the emergence of the lethal amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis). Formerly widespread and abundant, mountain yellow-legged frogs are grazers and highly connected high level predators, living in low diversity, low productivity high elevation lakes. Here, I examine the extent to which frog extinctions impact Sierra Nevada lake communities. First, in a study that combined surveys of benthic macroinvertebrates in 22 lakes over 5 years with a reanalysis of benthic macroinvertebrate community data from over 150 lakes, I found no strong differences in benthic macroinvertebrate community diversity or composition between lakes with frogs vs. lakes without frogs. I also conducted experiments to evaluate the impact of tadpoles as grazers on benthic algae, and found that tadpoles do reduce algal biomass in artificial habitats, but that the effect can be small and may not outweigh the influence that abiotic variability has on algal biomass in lakes. Lastly, while I documented that large and periodic tadpole aggregations create biogeochemical hotspots of dissolved nitrogen, the phenomena may not be widespread enough to drive differences in diatom diversity in lakes with vs. without tadpoles. Within lakes, I found little indication that diatom community diversity and composition were responding to tadpole generated nitrogen hotspots as a fluctuation-dependent mechanism with potential to enhance diatom coexistence. While none of the ecological effects of mountain yellow-legged frogs and tadpoles that I observed suggests that their extinctions are having large impacts on Sierra Nevada lake communities, they should not be discounted as expendable, because there are many other ways in which these amphibians could be important in their communities.",Nevada,-116.419389,38.8026097,16

Basin-wide SWE and its heterogeneity were modelled for four water years in the Marble Fork of the Kaweah River, a 152 km2 basin in the Sierra Nevada. Two components of the heterogeneity of SWE were examined: that owing to accumulation and that resulting from snowmelt. Heterogeneity caused by accumulation is represented by reconstructed SWE before the onset of melt. It is highest above the timberline, where wind causes redistribution and sublimation. Reconstruction accounts for the heterogeneity of wind-redistributed snow at the beginning of the melt season, even though it does not model the actual distribution processes. Thus it provides an independent method of measuring the spatial distribution of snow, which is useful to validate models of snow accumulation, either owing to redistribution or to precipitation itself. Heterogeneity caused by melt emerges from the calculations in Isnobal. Throughout spring it stays low above the timberline, while an increase occurs at the lowest snow-covered elevations as well as at the transition between forested and open areas. The spatial distribution of these trends persists in all four years of the study, but in the wettest year, 2006, the delayed onset of melt muted the heterogeneity. Forest cover is the dominating factor, with intermediate canopy cover causing the highest heterogeneity in melt.

Environmental Science and Management",Environmental Science and Management,Christina Tague,"This dissertation improves the understanding of how accounting for fine-scale variability of topography and soil is important for modeling ecohydrologic responses to climate change and variability in California's Sierra Nevada watersheds. In the first chapter, I apply the Regional Hydrologic-Ecologic Simulation System (RHESSys) to eight small watersheds and investigate how the spatial resolution of digital elevation model (DEM) resolution affects the accuracy of modeling streamflow and model estimates of ecohydrologic responses to inter-annual climate variability. Modeled streamflow estimates become worse with DEM resolution coarser than 10m, the explanation lying in the corresponding reduction in the spatial variance of the wetness index. In the second chapter, I use Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) to investigate the effect of soil parameter uncertainty in modeling ecohydrologic estimates in the two small watersheds with different snow regimes. The predictive uncertainty of annual evapotranspiration and net primary production estimates for a transient snow watershed are larger than those for a snow-dominated watershed, but the predictive uncertainty in model estimates for daily streamflow is larger for the snow-dominated watershed. The effect of soil parameter uncertainty varies seasonally, between wet and dry years, and its effect on ecohydrologic estimates is often large relative to the effect of climate warming. In the third chapter, I investigate the different hydrologic responses to climate warming between a snow-dominated watershed and a transient snow watershed. The modeling results show that the snow-dominated watershed has greater sensitivity to climate warming than the transient snow watershed. In the both watersheds, leaf area index and wetness index are primary factors controlling spatial patterns of seasonal evapotranspiration under both of historical climate conditions and climate warming scenarios. Climate warming results in increased spatial variability in monthly evapotranspiration, especially in the summer period. In the last chapter, I develop a strategic sampling design for collecting soil moisture and sapflux data to capture watershed ecohydrologic responses to inter-annual climate variability in a transient snow watershed. The comparison of model-based calculated hydrological similarity indicators with measured values shows that spatial patterns of field-sampled soil moisture data are similar to those of model-based estimates. However, the model fails to capture the soil moisture and sapflux dynamics in the riparian zone site, and in a site where lateral subsurface flow may not follow surface topography. Future research will reduce these errors by the use of finer-scale representations of microclimate, topography, vegetation, and soil properties in the model.",Nevada,-116.419389,38.8026097,16

Environmental Science and Management",Environmental Science and Management,Jeff Dozier,"The spatial distribution of snow and its melt over large river basins cannot be directly observed, complicating decisions for competing priorities of flood protection and resource use. This work aims to advance our ability to estimate snow distribution through improvements in the satellite observation of snow-covered area (SCA) and the modeling of snow water equivalent (SWE). I analyze the accuracies of three methods to map SCA from MODIS, a binary and a fractional method (MOD10A1) based on the normalized difference snow index (NDSI), and another fractional method based on spectral mixture analyses, MODSCAG. I find that fractional SCA estimates from MODSCAG perform best over a range of snow and vegetation conditions and the model maintains its retrieval ability in the transitional periods during accumulation and melt. Forest obstructs viewable snow cover, and satellite-viewing geometry has a larger effect on the fractional NDSI-based approach than MODSCAG. Adjustments to SCA to account for forest canopies permit MODSCAG to perform very well in all but the densest canopies while MOD10A1 shows early melt out, when compared with ground sensors, in sparse to moderately dense canopy. Combining satellite observed SCA and albedo with an energy balance model, I estimate spatially distributed snow water equivalent for 12 years in the Sierra Nevada. The model shows that the relationship of SWE with elevation is significantly different for wet, mean and dry years, between drainages and at different latitudes. SWE and SCA become increasingly correlated from March 1st to July 1st, such that real time SCA observations may be sufficient for SWE prediction. I compare spatially integrated volumes of snow water equivalent from this model and two real-time models with full natural flow estimates in 18 Sierra Nevada basins covering 70% of the streamflow range in the last 80 years. Forecasting errors that are based on statistical relationships between point measurements of snow and streamflow in these basins can reach 25% to 70% in one out of five years, a large error where reservoirs hold only the annual streamflow. The retrospective model best estimates the unimpaired streamflow and provides a way to evaluate the real-time models.",Nevada,-116.419389,38.8026097,16

Geography",Geography,Oliver A. Chadwick,"Global anthropogenic desiccation of lake basins in arid and semi-arid areas result in substantial increases in the flux of aeolian material. In California, Owens Lake playa has produced a tremendous amount of windblown dust since its desiccation in the early 20th century. In view of the potential danger to human health of the dust blowing off the playa, the chemistry and mineralogy of playa sediments and dust are well known. By contrast, the impact of the dust on surrounding soils and ecosystems in Owens Valley has been less well studied. This dissertation documents the accumulation of dust-derived salts from Owens Lake playa in nearby alluvial soils sourced from Sierra Nevada granite. I evaluate patterns of electrical conductivity (EC), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), and pH as proxies of salt incorporation with respect to depth in the soil profiles and with distance from the playa. I use two different approaches to determine whether salts measured in soils are derived from playa dust: arsenic (As) and ionic ratios of sodium (Na), lithium (Li), and calcium (Ca) to other major soil cations; and Sr isotopic ratios of 87Sr/86Sr. These are the first data to document the fate of Owens Lake playa dust in surrounding alluvial soils. Results indicate that playa dust is the source of salt levels found in soils more than 20 km away. More importantly, soils in direct proximity of the playa show a significant impact from playa-derived salt input. Based on extremely elevated salt levels in soils on the playa side of the nearby Alabama Hills, topography and variable wind-flow directions have important effects on sites downwind of dust sources; and these factors may be more important than mere distance from the playa in influencing the impact of salt-rich dust on soils along the Sierra Nevada alluvial piedmont. An evaluation of the severity of the impact of the playa dust on soils is a critical step toward assessing management decisions related to Owens Lake playa as well as many other lake basins that are rapidly desiccating under human influence.",Nevada,-116.419389,38.8026097,16

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Jordan Clark,"The current drought crisis in California highlights the vulnerability of freshwater resources, particularly groundwater reservoirs, which supply up to 60% of California's water during drought years. Understanding the potential impacts of climate change on groundwater recharge and storage is critical as drought periods become more frequent in the state. Groundwater residence times provide insight into groundwater recharge and transport mechanisms and storage capacities. This study developed and evaluated a new intrinsic tracer method to quantify groundwater recharge and transport using the occurrence of the naturally-produced radioisotope sulfur-35 (35S, half-life 87.5 days) in water as dissolved sulfate (35SO4). Improvements made to established analytical techniques expand the analytical range of 35SO4, which broadens the utility of 35SO 4 as a hydrologic tracer. The 35SO4 tracer method was applied to two distinct hydrologic settings: 1) high-elevation Sierra Nevada basins, and 2) low-elevations basins containing managed aquifer recharge (MAR) facilities. In the Sierra Nevada study, the new 35SO4 method was used to empirically constrain annual groundwater recharge in Sagehen Creek Basin (SCB) and Martis Valley Groundwater Basin (MVGB). Compared to relatively high 5SO4 activity in seasonal snowmelt (5.5 +/- 0.3 to 52.9 +/- 3.4 mBq/L), groundwater and surface water consistently yielded low 35SO4 activities resulting in a calculated percent new snowmelt (PNS) of <30%. The consistently low PNS suggests that recent (<1 year old) snowmelt represents only a small fraction of the larger aquifer system. As snowpack continues to decline due to climate change, streamflow and springs may respond in a two phase manner: rapid response in discharge followed by more gradual decreases over decades due to declines in groundwater recharge. The MAR study used 35SO4 to quantify groundwater travel times near MAR operations. MAR sites divert excess surface water, imported water, and reclaimed wastewater into surface-spreading ponds or direct injection wells to replenish groundwater in heavy-usage areas. Identifying groundwater travel times near MAR facilities is critical for determining the fate and transport of potential contaminants, especially for facilities that incorporate a significant portion of reclaimed wastewater. Successful application of the 35SO4 tracer method near MAR sites is dependent on careful characterization of the 35SO4 activity in source waters. Relative to established deliberate tracer experiments, which require extensive field and laboratory effort, the less intensive 35SO 4 technique showed comparable groundwater travel times at two MAR facilities located in southern California. Both the Sierra Nevada and MAR studies demonstrate that 35SO4 is a valuable, yet underutilized tracer in hydrologic studies.",Nevada,-116.419389,38.8026097,16

This study takes into account Las Vegas' rich material culture and spatial problematic in order to understand the interrelationship of violence, class, racism, and architectural practice that has produced the city's urban and cultural topography and traces the ways in which architecture and urban spaces were implicated in the struggle to locate opportunities for resistance in the face of rapid urban growth and discrimination.",Nevada,-116.419389,38.8026097,16

Feminist Studies",Feminist Studies,Leila J. Rupp,"Drawing on the tensions between biological determinism and social constructionism from my prior scholarship, this dissertation also shows that exposure to queer-normative erotic worlds fosters a willingness to question norms around sexuality and gender, which promotes a vision of what a utopian queer future could look like. The introduction to an educational environment where same-sex sexuality is not only normalized but embraced by the prevailing student culture creates a community where heterosexuality is not presumed as the default. Such a powerful sense of possibility and freedom rewrites the traditional coming-out narrative premised in failed attempts at heterosexuality and a discovery of one's ""true self"" and begs the question of what wider society would look like if more individuals were asked to challenge their assumptions about their own sexual and gender identities. Using snowball sampling, I interviewed fifty-six LGBTQ students and recent alumnae/i at Mount Holyoke College and Smith College - 32 at Mount Holyoke and 24 at Smith - and asked a range of open-ended questions drawing on the themes of sexual and gender identity, belonging to and disidentification with campus community, characteristics and definitions of queer community, and overall views on gender and sexuality. Performing a qualitative discourse analysis that builds on the theories of a diverse set of gender, sexuality, and critical race scholars, I argue that while the women's colleges studied act as empowering and transformational erotic worlds for sexual and gender exploration, queer hierarchies found in both institutions' student cultures promote gender-, race-, and class-based stratification. These hierarchies elevate white, typically class-privileged masculinity as most desirable while alienating queer students of color and low-income queer students through the maintenance of white-dominated, class-privileged space, sidelining and erasing queer femme students, and rendering transgender-spectrum students simultaneously invisible and hypervisible. This dissertation on the queer cultures found at two New England women's colleges, Mount Holyoke College and Smith College in western Massachusetts, engages in key debates over the value placed on community, identity, and visibility, demonstrating that all three concepts remain powerful and crucial organizing rubrics for many LGBTQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer) people. At the same time that the queer student cultures at these institutions are regarded by many current students and recent alumnae/i as celebratory havens for sexual and gender diversity, however, they are also implicated in intracommunal stratification and hierarchy, which I critically analyze using Adam Isaiah Green's sexual fields theory and Michel Foucault's theories on biopower and docile bodies. I consider the fundamental tensions that exist in spaces considered simultaneously utopic and oppressive, expanding in the conclusion on what these spaces can tell queer studies scholars about notions of queer futurity and utopia as theorized by Jose Esteban Munoz.",New England,-70.8227,43.9654,1

Geography",Geography,Keith Clarke,"This research focuses on measuring and monitoring long term recovery progress from the impacts of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans, LA. Remote sensing has frequently been used for emergency response and damage assessment after natural disasters. However, techniques for analysis of long term disaster recovery using remote sensing have not been widely explored. With increased availability and lower costs, remote sensing offers an objective perspective, systematic and repeatable analysis, and provides a substitute to multiple site visits. In addition, remote sensing allows access to large geographical areas and areas where ground access may be disrupted, restricted or denied. This dissertation addressed the primary difficulties involved in the development of change detection methods capable of detecting changes experienced by disaster recovery indicators. Maximum likelihood classification and post-classification change detection were applied to multi-temporal high resolution aerial images to quantitatively measure the progress of recovery. Images were classified to automatically identify disaster recovery indicators and exploit the indicators that are visible within each image. The spectral analysis demonstrated that employing maximum likelihood classification to high resolution true color aerial images performed adequately and provided a good indication of spectral pattern recognition, despite the limited spectral information. Applying the change detection to the classified images was effective for determining the temporal trajectory of indicators categorized as blue tarps, FEMA trailers, houses, vegetation, bare earth and pavement. The results of the post classification change detection revealed a dominant change trajectory from bluetarp to house, as damaged houses became permanently repaired. Specifically, the level of activity of blue tarps, housing, vegetation, FEMA trailers (temporary housing) pavement and bare earth were derived from aerial image processing to measure and monitor the progress of recovery. Trajectories of recovery for each individual indicator were examined to provide a better understanding of activity during reconstruction. A collection of spatial metrics was explored in order to identify spatial patterns and characterize classes in terms of patches of pixels. One of the key findings of the spatial analysis is that patch shapes were more complex in the presence of debris and damaged or destroyed buildings. The combination of spectral, temporal, and spatial analysis provided a satisfactory, though limited, solution to the question of whether remote sensing alone, can be used to quantitatively assess and monitor the progress of long term recovery following a major disaster. The research described in this dissertation provided a detailed illustration of the level of activity experienced by different recovery indicators during the long term recovery process. It also addressed the primary difficulties involved in the development of change detection methods capable of detecting changes experienced by disaster recovery indicators identified from classified high resolution true color aerial imagery. The results produced in this research demonstrate that the observed trajectories for actual indicators of recovery indicate different levels of recovery activity even within the same community. The level of activity of the long term reconstruction phase observed in the Kates model is not consistent with the level of activity of key recovery indicators in the Lower 9th Ward during the same period. Used in the proper context, these methods and results provide decision making information for determining resources.

Feminist Studies",Feminist Studies,Grace Chang,"My main research questions explore how contradictions of unity, organizing structures, gender, sexuality, citizenship, class, and ability are addressed within Filipino leftist organizations that utilize dialectical materialist theory. I also ask: How have US-based women of color feminist and queer of color theory impacted Filipino nationalist frameworks in the US? How do they also remain at odds with one another? I interviewed 21 NYC-based activists and organizers involved in anti-imperialist Filipino organizations the summer of 2012. I also used participant observation as an active member of study groups, educational workshops, and a town forum. My central framework explores conflict as contradiction using Mao Tse-tung's ""On Contradiction"" and the Haitian concepts of balans and konesans. In doing so, I examine how hard-lined leadership has impeded dialogue. I also interrogate how sexism, transphobia, masculinist organizing structures, and neoliberalism impact women, trans, queer, disabled, working class, and undocumented organizers---particularly those with overlapping identities of marginalization. ""The Movement's"" familial dynamic, combined with the value of utang na loob, creates hierarchies that cause some members to feel both silenced and guilty. I name these feelings as indicators of invisible emotional labor ""for the sake of the movement"" that lead many members to eventually leave their organizations. Their departures raise questions of sustainability. Lastly, I ask how the Fil-Am Left can draw strength from its familial dynamic but still address hierarchical issues that mirror societal hierarchies of oppression. Applying work by Patricia Hill Collins, Audre Lorde, and other women of color, along with feminist grounded theory and sociological movement theory, I highlight three strategies that New York City based Filipino organizations have taken within the past ten years. I argue that organizations have recognized problems with sustainability and are creating their own interventions as theory-producers. Organizers' relationships to the National Democratic movement in the Philippines shape both the creation of interventions and how they respond to new ideas.

History",History,Patricia Cline Cohen,"This dissertation examines the United States-based communitarian socialists known as the Fourierists as a piece of the larger international Fourierist movement, highlighting the numerous points of contact between Fourierists and their counterparts on each side of the Atlantic. My goal is to understand Fourierism as a multinational movement that sparked an international conversation among its members, which made it one of the most cosmopolitan of the reform movements to emerge from the social tumult in the 1840s. Its Janus-faced focus on the U.S. reform landscape and fixed connection with European Fourierists made Fourierism arguably the most dynamic reform movement of the nineteenth century. It is a story of connectivity among individuals who believed they possessed a new moral framework for remaking the world. The theories of the French social philosopher Charles Fourier also helped change the course of antebellum reform in the United States by introducing important themes and an entirely new vocabulary to the reform lexicon. The strength of the Fourierist press in the United States, especially the celebrated journal The Harbinger, highlights the movement's fingerprint on the course of American journalism. I will explore how and why this movement spread so far from the 1830s-1850s, and how these activists transcended national identity in order to realize the plan of perfecting the world's ills through the adoption of Fourier's experimental living arrangements. As a movement based on experiment, exchange, and collaboration, Fourierism intermingled freely with other mid-century reform movements including abolition, women's rights, free love, as well as workingmen's and other socialist movements. Traveling Fourierist leaders, the growth of Fourierist journalism, and the community of early Fourierists in New York City fostered complex identities in those at the heart of the movement. Their involvement in multiple causes demonstrates the international roots of mid-nineteenth-century reform. While adherents in each nation adapted Fourier's message to their own specific national context, the fluidity of the larger philosophy transcended borders, helping create an international reform identity in an age usually best known for a parochial nationalism. Using archival sources and published journals and periodicals from France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, this dissertation follows a chronological analysis of the movement's international layers. I examine the period from the movement's inception in the 1830s to its height in 1846, focusing on Fourierism's importation to the United States and its evolution from a cosmopolitan group of European and Francophone expatriates in New York City to a more Americanized version championed by Horace Greeley and Albert Brisbane with intentional appeal to workingmen. I also focus on the decline of Fourierism in the late 1840s, the pivotal year of the French Revolution of 1848, and the growth of the Free Love movement from Fourierism's ashes in the early 1850s. This dissertation compels scholars to look closer at the Fourierist movement as a case study in successfully changing the vocabulary of social reformers, bringing attention to the problems inherent within industrial capitalism, offering an inclusive approach to labor reform which included women's rights, and an alternative to the bourgeois home. Fourierism was at the center of a dialogue on gender norms and sexuality that would ultimately include members of the organized women's rights movement and advocates of the controversial free love movement. The Fourierist movement's communal ethos promised to improve the lives of women by ameliorating the drudgery of housework and providing shared child-rearing opportunities. Additionally, Charles Fourier's highly controversial theories on sexual liberation and marriage reform led some Fourierists to challenge reigning sexual mores. Studying the works of the Fourierists reveal new insights into the attitudes about gender and sexuality within the larger world of mid-nineteenth-century reform in the United States and Europe. Fourierism inspired a debate about gender, marriage, and religion that changed the language and tactics of mid-nineteenth-century reform.",New York,-74.0059728,40.7127753,14

Linguistics",Linguistics,"Stefan Th. Gries, Fermin Moscoso del Prado","One area of research on distributional learning algorithms in which there remains relatively little work is the learning of multi-word, memorized, formulaic sequences, based on the co-occurrences of words. Examples of such multi-word expressions (MWEs) include kick the bucket, New York City, sit down, and as a matter of fact. In this dissertation, I present a novel computational approach to the distributional learning of such sequences in corpora. Entitled MERGE (Multi-word Expressions from the Recursive Grouping of Elements), my algorithm iteratively works by (1) assigning a statistical 'attraction' score to each two-word sequence (bigram) in a corpus, based on the individual and co-occurrence frequencies of these two words in that corpus; and (2) merging the highest-scoring bigram into a single, lexicalized unit. These two steps then repeat until some maximum number of iterations or minimum score threshold is reached (since, broadly speaking, the winning score progressively decreases with increasing iterations). Because one (or both) of the 'words' making up a winning bigram may be an output merged item from a previous iteration, the algorithm is able to learn MWEs that are in principle of any length (e.g., apple pie versus I'll believe it when I see it). Moreover, these MWEs may contain one or more discontinuities of different sizes, up to some maximum size threshold (measured in words) specified by the user (e.g., as _ as in as tall as and as big as). Typically, the extraction of MWEs has been handled by algorithms that identify only continuous sequences, and in which the user must specify the length(s) of the sequences to be extracted beforehand; thus, MERGE offers a bottom-up, distributional-based approach that addresses these issues. Finally, in a study using two corpora of caregiver-child interactions, I run MERGE on caregiver utterances and then show that, of the MWEs induced by the algorithm, those that go on to be later acquired by the children receive higher scores by the algorithm than those that do not go on to be learned. These results suggest that, when applied to acquisition data, the algorithm is useful for identifying the structures of statistical co-occurrences in the caregiver input that are relevant to children in their acquisition of early multi-word knowledge. In the present dissertation, in addition to describing the algorithm, I report three rating experiments and one corpus-based early child language study that validate the efficacy of MERGE in identifying MWEs. In one experiment, participants rate sequences extracted from a corpus by the algorithm for how well they instantiate true MWEs. As expected, the results reveal that the high-scoring output items that MERGE identifies early in its iterative process are rated as 'good' MWEs by participants (based on certain subjective criteria), with the quality of these ratings decreasing for output from later iterations (i.e., output items that were scored lower by the algorithm). There has been much recent research in corpus and computational linguistics on distributional learning algorithms---computer code that induces latent linguistic structures in corpus data based on co-occurrences of transcribed units in that data. These algorithms have varied applications, from the investigation of human cognitive processes to the corpus extraction of relevant linguistic structures for lexicographic, second language learning, or natural language processing applications, among others. They also operate at various levels of linguistic structure, from phonetics to syntax. Overall, MERGE is shown to be a powerful computational approach to the distributional learning and extraction of MWEs, both when modeling adult knowledge of formulaic language, and when accounting for the early multi-word structures acquired by children.

Linguistics",Linguistics,"Stefan Th. Gries, Fermin Moscoso del Prado","One area of research on distributional learning algorithms in which there remains relatively little work is the learning of multi-word, memorized, formulaic sequences, based on the co-occurrences of words. Examples of such multi-word expressions (MWEs) include kick the bucket, New York City, sit down, and as a matter of fact. In this dissertation, I present a novel computational approach to the distributional learning of such sequences in corpora. Entitled MERGE (Multi-word Expressions from the Recursive Grouping of Elements), my algorithm iteratively works by (1) assigning a statistical 'attraction' score to each two-word sequence (bigram) in a corpus, based on the individual and co-occurrence frequencies of these two words in that corpus; and (2) merging the highest-scoring bigram into a single, lexicalized unit. These two steps then repeat until some maximum number of iterations or minimum score threshold is reached (since, broadly speaking, the winning score progressively decreases with increasing iterations). Because one (or both) of the 'words' making up a winning bigram may be an output merged item from a previous iteration, the algorithm is able to learn MWEs that are in principle of any length (e.g., apple pie versus I'll believe it when I see it). Moreover, these MWEs may contain one or more discontinuities of different sizes, up to some maximum size threshold (measured in words) specified by the user (e.g., as _ as in as tall as and as big as). Typically, the extraction of MWEs has been handled by algorithms that identify only continuous sequences, and in which the user must specify the length(s) of the sequences to be extracted beforehand; thus, MERGE offers a bottom-up, distributional-based approach that addresses these issues. Finally, in a study using two corpora of caregiver-child interactions, I run MERGE on caregiver utterances and then show that, of the MWEs induced by the algorithm, those that go on to be later acquired by the children receive higher scores by the algorithm than those that do not go on to be learned. These results suggest that, when applied to acquisition data, the algorithm is useful for identifying the structures of statistical co-occurrences in the caregiver input that are relevant to children in their acquisition of early multi-word knowledge. In the present dissertation, in addition to describing the algorithm, I report three rating experiments and one corpus-based early child language study that validate the efficacy of MERGE in identifying MWEs. In one experiment, participants rate sequences extracted from a corpus by the algorithm for how well they instantiate true MWEs. As expected, the results reveal that the high-scoring output items that MERGE identifies early in its iterative process are rated as 'good' MWEs by participants (based on certain subjective criteria), with the quality of these ratings decreasing for output from later iterations (i.e., output items that were scored lower by the algorithm). There has been much recent research in corpus and computational linguistics on distributional learning algorithms---computer code that induces latent linguistic structures in corpus data based on co-occurrences of transcribed units in that data. These algorithms have varied applications, from the investigation of human cognitive processes to the corpus extraction of relevant linguistic structures for lexicographic, second language learning, or natural language processing applications, among others. They also operate at various levels of linguistic structure, from phonetics to syntax. Overall, MERGE is shown to be a powerful computational approach to the distributional learning and extraction of MWEs, both when modeling adult knowledge of formulaic language, and when accounting for the early multi-word structures acquired by children. In the other two experiments, participants rate high-ranking output both from MERGE and from an existing algorithm from the literature that also learns MWEs of various lengths---the Adjusted Frequency List (Brook O'Donnell 2011).

Feminist Studies",Feminist Studies,Grace Chang,"My main research questions explore how contradictions of unity, organizing structures, gender, sexuality, citizenship, class, and ability are addressed within Filipino leftist organizations that utilize dialectical materialist theory. I also ask: How have US-based women of color feminist and queer of color theory impacted Filipino nationalist frameworks in the US? How do they also remain at odds with one another? I interviewed 21 NYC-based activists and organizers involved in anti-imperialist Filipino organizations the summer of 2012. I also used participant observation as an active member of study groups, educational workshops, and a town forum. My central framework explores conflict as contradiction using Mao Tse-tung's ""On Contradiction"" and the Haitian concepts of balans and konesans. In doing so, I examine how hard-lined leadership has impeded dialogue. I also interrogate how sexism, transphobia, masculinist organizing structures, and neoliberalism impact women, trans, queer, disabled, working class, and undocumented organizers---particularly those with overlapping identities of marginalization. ""The Movement's"" familial dynamic, combined with the value of utang na loob, creates hierarchies that cause some members to feel both silenced and guilty. I name these feelings as indicators of invisible emotional labor ""for the sake of the movement"" that lead many members to eventually leave their organizations. Their departures raise questions of sustainability. Lastly, I ask how the Fil-Am Left can draw strength from its familial dynamic but still address hierarchical issues that mirror societal hierarchies of oppression. Applying work by Patricia Hill Collins, Audre Lorde, and other women of color, along with feminist grounded theory and sociological movement theory, I highlight three strategies that New York City based Filipino organizations have taken within the past ten years. I argue that organizations have recognized problems with sustainability and are creating their own interventions as theory-producers. Organizers' relationships to the National Democratic movement in the Philippines shape both the creation of interventions and how they respond to new ideas. Drawing on Arlie Hoschchild's concept of ""stalled revolution,"" individual behaviors lag behind organizations' formal ideological shifts.

Anthropology",Anthropology,Susan C. Stonich,"This dissertation characterizes the ways in which increased global connectedness differentially impacts agricultural decisions among the ethnically-diverse farming households in Atlantic Nicaragua's Pearl Lagoon Basin, with specific focus on farmers' maintenance of agrobiodiversity. Research conducted in other parts of the world has shown correlations between a farmer's ethnic identity and the agrobiodiversity they maintain within their farming systems. These trends remain even as small-scale farmers are connected to extra-local political and economic systems, which are cited as the drivers of global agrobiodiversity erosion. Yet, how ethnicity influences the maintenance of agrobiodiversity is poorly understood. Employing a political ecology framework that integrates ethnographic, demographic, survey, and agroecological methods, this research identifies that ethnically-distinct planting strategies exist among the Pearl Lagoon Basin's indigenous (Miskito), Afro-descendant (Creole and Garifuna), and mestizo farmers. Consistent with patterns identified by researchers elsewhere, farmers who identify with the area's indigenous and afro-descendant ""minority"" groups tend to maintain more diverse farms than nearby farmers who identify as mestizo, particularly those who are recent migrants to the region. In contrast to the findings of previous studies, however, the most connected farmers in the Basin tend to have the highest levels of agrobiodiversity within their farming systems. Qualitative and regression analyses reveal that ethnic patterns in the maintenance of agrobiodiversity are explained in part by the historical farming practices that characterize land use in the Basin and the agroecological knowledge that farmers develop over a lifetime farming in this socio-ecological context. Further, by acknowledging the plastic nature of ethnic identity, this research also highlights the importance of ethnic-based land rights in the Nicaragua's Atlantic Autonomous Region as a critical factor that both directly and indirectly influences the ethnic identities of farmers in the Pearl Lagoon Basin and their abilities to participate in agricultural development projects whose extension activities promote agrobiodiversity conservation.",Nicaragua,-85.207229,12.865416,1

Geography",Geography,Christopher Still,"Populus tremuloides (Quaking Aspen) has the greatest range of any tree species in North America and is found throughout widely variable habitats. The occurrence of aspen in its habitats is partially driven by a suite of climatic characteristics whose means and extremes directly and indirectly affect the suitability of sites. These characteristics of climate under which aspen survive and thrive can be defined as its climatic niche. However, aspen populations in different regions may experience very different climates and have different phenotypes. Thus, for a species that is so widely distributed, how does one characterize its climatic niche? Do aspen inhabit one climatic niche, or several regional niches that could result in differences in genotype and phenotype? This thesis explores the similarities and differences of climatic niche for this species and how regionally, climatic niche may be different. Eastern and western climatic niche groupings were discovered with differences in potential evapotranspiration (PET), growing degree days (GDD), and mean annual precipitation (MAP). Time series analysis uncovered trends of increasing temperature minimums resulting in increasing GDD for western aspen since 1990. Differences between the eastern and western aspens' climatic niches may relate to clone size and structure as well as favored reproductive strategies and biotic interactions such as competition with other tree species that are not treated here. This work is a first step in quantifying differences in climatic niche for aspen in the lower 48 states and can advise how aspen may respond differently, by region, to climate changes.",North America,-105.2551187,54.5259614,1

For example, improvements to age models for paleoclimate records from marine sediment cores were central to proving Milankovitch theory. In this dissertation, I compiled a quality-controlled database of almost 300 previously published benthic foraminiferal oxygen isotope (delta 18O) records from globally distributed sites. The only way to directly date marine sediments is by radiocarbon dating, but this technique can only be used back to about 40,000 years ago and is subject to uncertainties about past surface reservoir age changes. Chapter 2 presents an averaged high-latitude North Atlantic reservoir age reconstruction based on aligning 33 deep North Atlantic benthic delta18O records and comparing high- and low-latitude planktonic foraminiferal radiocarbon dates. This reconstruction shows increased reservoir ages during the beginning of the last deglaciation and the Younger Dryas, which suggests that previous chronologies based on the assumption of constant reservoir age need to be revised by up to about 1,000 years. North Atlantic reservoir ages are also a proxy for Atlantic meridional overturning circulation strength, so deglacial reservoir age excursions provide insight into the timing and role of ocean circulation changes during the deglaciation. Regional benthic delta18O stacks and chronologies fill an important niche between global stacks and studies comparing a few well-dated records. Chapter 3 presents seven different regional benthic delta 18O stacks with independent planktonic 14C-based age models for 0-40,000 years ago. The stacks show regional differences in the timing of benthic delta18O change of up to 4,000 years during the last deglaciation. In Chapters 4 and 5, the Atlantic, Pacific, and Indian benthic delta18O stacks are extended beyond the limits of radiocarbon to 145,000 years ago and combined into a single volume-weighted global stack. The regional stacks aligned to proxy data with well-constrained absolute age estimates provide improved chronostratigraphic constraints for the last glacial cycle. The volume-weighted global stack demonstrates errors of up to 4,000 years in the currently accepted global benthic delta 18O stack.",North Atlantic,-93.1678139,37.8563429,1

Geography",Geography,Keith C. Clarke,"This study is the first study about North Korea using geotagged social media data. It indicates that social media data has a rigorous potential and can be a new source for an EWS. This new approach method with social media data can be applied to other closed countries. After the Korean War in 1950, the Korean Peninsula was divided into North and South Korea. From that time on, a hostile stand-off has persisted for more than 60 years. After Kim Jong-un come to power, North Korea's provocations, such as the Yeon-Pyong Island bombardment and the attack of a Chen-an South Korean navy ship, reached a new level. North Korea is still threatening international societies by developing Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) such as nuclear weapons and Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles. Moreover, as we saw from the 'Sony hack incident' where Sony Pictures Entertainment was hacked by North Korea in 2014 because of the film 'The Interview,' North Korea is now concentrating on cyber warfare. Thus, because of these incidents, the need for an advanced Early Warning System (EWS) against North Korea is increasing. For the tag analysis of Flickr and Twitter, all tags were counted and high-frequency tags were extracted and visualized with Word Cloud techniques. Lastly, various maps were generated using several visualization techniques. Second, 12,394 tweets from all over the world during the 'Sony hack incident' were analyzed for a case study. Study findings revealed that Twitter data provides a real time reflection of user's interest, event, place and time. Although North Koreans cannot use the Internet or social media applications, there were 11 tweets from North Korea and all of the locations for tweets were identified by Google Earth. By doing so, the potential flaws in using social media data, such as IP address hacking, were found. This thesis demonstrates the potential of social media data as a new source to collect Geo-spatial Intelligence (GeoINT) for an advanced EWS. In this thesis, structural analysis, based on geospatial data and content analysis utilizing images and text tags were conducted using two different datasets, Flickr and Twitter. First, a new approach for geotagged image processing was designed using the K-means and Spectral clustering algorithm using 3,981 North Korea Flickr images over a period of 11 years. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) demonstrated that image entropy is an effective input parameter for image characterization. We concluded that the Spectral clustering algorithm is suitable for selecting outlier images. In addition, Centrographic statistics were applied for the analysis of spatial and temporal dynamics. As a result, geotagged social media data revealed their user's behavior and interest by time and space.",North Korea,127.5101,40.3399,1

Sociology",Sociology,William I. Robinson,"As a result of the Oscar Grant 'moment', popular social bodies made significant gains - by disrupting networks of elites who were advancing gentrification and policing, as well as breaking the veritable impunity to law enforcement officers who murder extra-judiciously. More importantly, and as activist accounts and analyses state, popular social bodies deepened their analyses of law enforcement and the 'non-profit industrial complex', as well as deepened their networks and ties, all of which allowed for the intensity and maturation of struggle manifest in the Occupy Oakland 'moment'. While gains were made through the synergistic condensation of popular self-activity from different networks of people, we are still left wanting by way of re-/producing a radically democratic social order, and the synergy of popular self-activity necessary to do so cannot be left to happenstance. As such, open-ended questions about making radical political praxis mundane in 'ordinary' times are proposed. Rather than bring people to extraordinary acts of radical political praxis in moments of crisis, how do we weave radical political praxis into the mundane and the practical of 'ordinary' times? How do we produce radically democratic, popular vehicles to resolve pressing, popular issues and realize collective utopian visions? This dissertation demonstrates racial capitalism as the principal contradiction that negates human dignity and life by reviewing the development of racial capitalism in Oakland, the contemporary forms of premature death it produces, as well as naming some of the contemporary projects and agents that are profitably repressing and antagonizing popular social bodies through gentrification and saturation policing. Furthermore, using grassroots and independent media as an archive, this dissertation examines the popular self-activity that condensed into and produced the Oscar Grant ""moment"". This demonstrates the robust condensation of popular self-activity from a multitude of different groups and traditions - from radical political traditions of anarchism and marxism, to those active in the cultural production of hip hop -- as well how people from seemingly apolitical networks and active in seemingly apolitical pursuits contributed to this moment of intensified struggle. There are a number of limitations when the Oscar Grant 'moment' is mentioned, documented, or analyzed in academic literature. The extrajudicial police murder of Oscar Grant is reductively credited to a static, transhistoric racism, and the popular self-activity that made Grant's murder known are erased or under-analyzed. This, perhaps, is because academics appear to have not engaged the texts produced by radical activist-scholars, texts that contain the most accurate historical accounts and erudite analyses of this moment. While there is consistency to white supremacy and the premature death it produces, such a reductive portrayal obscures the historically and geographic specific projects and networks of social bodies that are re-/articulating racial regimes particular to specific times and places -- leaving sites for popular intervention unnamed. In performing the necessary work of demonstrating the forces of racial capitalism and its bloody consequences, we might lose sight of popular self-activity, the means of producing a radically democratic social order. The Oscar Grant 'moment' was a period of intensified struggle in Oakland - starting just before Oscar Grant, a young Black man, was murdered by transit police officer Johannes Mehserle on January 1st, 2009, and lasting (at least) until November 5th, 2010 (when Johannes Mehserle was sentenced for involuntary manslaughter). Despite local news coverage, and subsequent popular cultural texts, few academic texts engage the Oscar Grant ""moment"", a moment rich for analysis as a number of social issues can be refracted and studied -- from resistance, to the expansion and militarization of policing, to gentrification, neoliberal multiculturalism in urban planning, gentrification, the 'non-profit industrial complex', to the repression of social struggles.",Oakland,-122.2711137,37.8043637,2

Latin American and Iberian Studies",Latin American and Iberian Studies,Casey Walsh,"Afro-Mexicans in Costa Chica, Oaxaca to date do not identify with the aforementioned label but rather as Mexicans, Costen s, Moren s, Negr s. In 1998, however, Oaxaca became the first state to ""recognize"" and ascribe them under that ethnic label; thus, placing their collective rights under Indigenous laws. Though, no official headcount statistics or adequate public policies exist for the estimated 15,000 Afro-Mexicans. According to government studies, Afro-Mexicans have an ethnic deficit based on their lack of cultural characteristics that differentiate them from mestizos-costenos. As part of negotiating this matter, by 2004, the black civil association AFRICA invented a tradition of Afro-Mexican Queen Pageants (AMQPs hereafter) called ""La Reyna Afromestiza"" (The Afromestiza Queen). Four years later, in April of 2008, the image of the 1st crowned queen was then chosen for the cover of the 1st Oaxacan government journal dedicated to the Afro-Mexican population. These examples in turn raise the following questions: 1) What are the missing ""ethnic"" characteristics that disqualify Afro-Mexicans as an ethnic group? 2) How are AMQPs mirroring internal and external politics of representation? 3) To what extent are the state and civil associations (NGOs) transforming the meaning and contours of blackness in Oaxaca? Beginning with the birth of the Afromestizo project in 1950 to what followed after the birth of the black social movement in 1997, this investigation will examine the difficulties of ethnicizing blackness in Costa Chica, Oaxaca. By first offering a social-historical background of the region as well as highlighting the inter-ethnicity of Afro-Mexicans I draw attention to the interplay of ethnic-racial politics. More specifically, this study analyzes how AFRICA has, since 2007, steered the strategies of the movement in order to construct collective black political consciousness. In the process, I address how this organization has manipulated the media and public festivities---in their community and beyond---to give visibility and challenge Oaxaca's models of multicultural and pluriethnic policies. Using an interdisciplinary approach, I argue that AMQPs are a fine example of how AFRICA manipulates the performance and aesthetics of public space to construct black ethnic consciousness within costeno culture. In addition, I explain how they serve as ideal platforms to reclaim Mexican citizenship. Overall, this study will explore questions of ethnicity, race, memory, ritual and cultural-reinvention.",Oaxaca,-96.7132304,17.0542297,1

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Alexander R. Simms,"The Younger Dryas is a well-recognized climatic event, but researchers have yet to agree upon which mechanism was responsible for the rapid cooling in the northern hemisphere. A spike in nanodiamond presence at the Younger Dryas boundary has been reported in sediments from the Bull Creek valley in Oklahoma and used to support a recently proposed impact hypothesis. However, this record was compiled from a heterogeneous mix of sediment from different fluvial subenvironments. In order for the significance of a unique occurrence of nanodiamonds to be determined, a full appreciation of the other changes that occurred within the valley throughout its evolution must be taken into account. These changes may have impacted sediment character as well as sediment preservation and the processes governing deposition, all of which could impact nanodiamond accumulation and preservation. The purpose of this study is to build an evolutionary model for the Bull Creek valley spanning the last 16,000 years in order to place nanodiamond occurrence into stratigraphic context. Fluvial terraces were mapped and their sediments described within the valley. Results indicate the valley has undergone at least four cycles of cutting and filling, creating five sets of discontinuous fluvial terraces. The sedimentary sequence preserved in the terraces records the transition from a perennial fluvial system during the late glacial to a cool yet dry environment during the Younger Dryas, followed by an arid environment dominated by eolian processes and punctuated by flooding events. Although the sediment character of the Younger Dryas soil is unique, the occurrence of nanodiamonds within it is not. No correlation was found between nanodiamond abundance and landscape exposure time.",Oklahoma,-97.092877,35.0077519,3

History of Art and Architecture",History of Art and Architecture,Nuha N. N. Khoury,"This work re-considers current descriptions of pre-colonial Swahili stone architecture by applying formal analysis to structures from the 'golden age' of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries and the Swahili heartland regions of mainland Tanzania and Kenya. The results of this analysis are compared to mainstream descriptions of Swahili architecture. They are then used to make comparisons between the remains of pre-colonial Swahili stone structures and those in built environments that are popularly identified as essentially 'Islamic.' This project seeks to generate an updated description of early Swahili architecture while providing a useful case study of Islamic architecture at the margins of the field. The data for this work was attained through a combination of archival and onsite research. The latter was carried out through visits to Kenya and Tanzania over the course of two summers, 2006 and 2009. The analysis is separated into sections focusing on religious, domestic and public spaces that were chosen from a cross section of stone town sites. The findings support that pre-colonial Swahili spaces were designed by and for the local Swahili community. The analysis of religious structures suggests that nine-bay mosques may have had a commemorative function. For larger mosques it is proposed that longitudinal orientation and the visual obstruction of the mihrab by central pillars are deliberate (rather than accidental) features that were intended to emphasize the direction of prayer. The analysis of housing reveals that pre-colonial Swahili stone houses exhibit only minimal degrees of visual restriction: the stringently gendered, intimacy gradient that is thought to circumscribe both social and physical Swahili space was a relatively late development that can be linked to the period of Omani colonization in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The late colonial period also marks the earliest evidence of a formal relationship between Swahili stone houses and coastal South Arabian houses. The analysis of public space suggests that pre-sixteenth century parallels between Mijikenda and Swahili urban form are tenuous at best. When these parallels exist they can be ascribed to a shared cultural climate without the necessity of identifying direct links between one or another local groups.",Oman,55.975413,21.4735329,1

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Stanley Awramik,"The chert members of the Paleoproterozoic Gunflint Formation, Ontario, Canada, are commonly regarded as examples of primary silica chemical sediments. This interpretation is founded upon the high fidelity of preservation of microfossils in the chert, the ubiquitous nature of silica, and a lack of observed primary carbonate. Previous arguments for silica replacement of limestone (carbonate) are based on indirect evidence and are largely dismissed. Gunflint microfossils are thus regarded as having lived in a silica-rich environment, which makes them unusual compared to most other pre-Phanerozoic microfossils that are known from silicified carbonates. Direct evidence that carbonate was a primary mineral species of the Lower Algal Chert Member (where most of the microbiota are found) has been discovered at Whitefish Falls, Nolalu, Ontario. Iron-stained, low-Mg calcite ooids containing (1) well-preserved growth laminae, (2) textures indicating a disrupted tangential fabric of growth laminae, and (3) quartz cross-cutting the growth laminae indicate the initial mineral of the ooids was a carbonate, probably aragonite. Stromatolite columns contain large areas of low-Mg calcite, with specular hematite crystals that display cross-cutting relationships with calcite and quartz that demonstrate calcite was primary, hematite secondary, and quartz tertiary. The cross-cutting relations also show that silicification took place in at least two stages. One of the silicification events took place very early in diagenesis. Thus the Gunflint microbiota may not have existed in a radically different environment (silica precipitating) than those of most other known Proterozoic microbiotas. High fidelity of preservation of microfossils does not always indicate that the mineral entombing them was the primary mineral precipitated from aqueous solution.",Ontario,-85.3232,51.2538,1

In this dissertation, I described present-day pH variability in three coastal regions and used the data to design laboratory experiments assessing the physiological response of two organisms, sea urchins and mussels, to changing ocean conditions. As recorded by autonomous pH sensors, I found three unique patterns of coastal pH variability. Near-shore Antarctica was characterized by a steep seasonal increase in pH and pH variability during summer phytoplankton blooms.

Ten smart growth projects (SGPs) in four cities within California and Oregon were identified and semi-structured interviews were held with the respective developers, architects and civic officials, who were involved in the implementation process. Comparative, descriptive and grounded approaches were used to generate themes from interviews and other data sources. The dissertation culminates with a concluding chapter that briefly assesses the findings and their implications for social science, economic practice, and public policy. American urban development is characterized by urban sprawl: the low-density, single-family housing and separated land uses that are dependent on automobile transportation. Sprawl has negative affects for the environment and for social health. In the last twenty years, planners and developers have adopted smart growth principles. Smart growth is a land-use philosophy and practice that promotes higher density housing, mixed-use neighborhoods, more open spaces, transit alternatives to the automobile, and social equity through mixed-income neighborhoods. It is viewed as an alternative to sprawl. The research project first examines the structural and cultural features of communities that both support and oppose smart growth development. This dissertation then examines whether or not smart growth represents a break from the practices of conventional urban development, long theorized as a growth machine. The growth machine describes the collusion of land-use interests with local government to direct economic growth. The purpose of this inquiry is to determine if there is an empirically distinct smart growth machine.",Oregon,-120.5542012,43.8041334,5

Geography",Geography,Oliver A. Chadwick,"Global anthropogenic desiccation of lake basins in arid and semi-arid areas result in substantial increases in the flux of aeolian material. In California, Owens Lake playa has produced a tremendous amount of windblown dust since its desiccation in the early 20th century. In view of the potential danger to human health of the dust blowing off the playa, the chemistry and mineralogy of playa sediments and dust are well known. By contrast, the impact of the dust on surrounding soils and ecosystems in Owens Valley has been less well studied. This dissertation documents the accumulation of dust-derived salts from Owens Lake playa in nearby alluvial soils sourced from Sierra Nevada granite. I evaluate patterns of electrical conductivity (EC), sodium adsorption ratio (SAR), and pH as proxies of salt incorporation with respect to depth in the soil profiles and with distance from the playa. I use two different approaches to determine whether salts measured in soils are derived from playa dust: arsenic (As) and ionic ratios of sodium (Na), lithium (Li), and calcium (Ca) to other major soil cations; and Sr isotopic ratios of 87Sr/86Sr. These are the first data to document the fate of Owens Lake playa dust in surrounding alluvial soils. Results indicate that playa dust is the source of salt levels found in soils more than 20 km away. More importantly, soils in direct proximity of the playa show a significant impact from playa-derived salt input. Based on extremely elevated salt levels in soils on the playa side of the nearby Alabama Hills, topography and variable wind-flow directions have important effects on sites downwind of dust sources; and these factors may be more important than mere distance from the playa in influencing the impact of salt-rich dust on soils along the Sierra Nevada alluvial piedmont. An evaluation of the severity of the impact of the playa dust on soils is a critical step toward assessing management decisions related to Owens Lake playa as well as many other lake basins that are rapidly desiccating under human influence.",Owens Lake playa,-117.9600466,36.436157,1

Film and Media Studies",Film and Media Studies,Michael Curtin,"How does hope emerge amidst a hopeless situation, freedom amidst apartheid, equality amidst inequality? In the context of Palestine, where is utopian located? A possible answer to these enigmas presented itself in a Freedom March organized by a group of Palestinians in the occupied West Bank city of Hebron in March 2013. Carrying Palestinian flags, they crossed into a forbidden zone, boldly walking into the section of the street designated for Jewish settlers only. On their faces were masks of Martin Luther King, Jr., in their hands were portraits of Rosa Parks, and on their shirts were four English words: ""I have a dream"". By resurrecting the imagery and iconography of the US Black Freedom Movement, these Palestinians were drawing new, imaginative constellations of counterhegemonic protest and forging transnational links of solidarity across time and space. The demonstrators thus staged a disruption. They temporarily interrupted the status quo and transgressed the rules and regulations of the hegemonic order. As a result, they were swiftly apprehended by uniformed members of the Israeli Defense Forces. As if to reenact a scene from Birmingham or Selma, the soldiers ripped the flags from the protesters' hands and placed them in handcuffs. With MLK masks still on their faces, the demonstrators were loaded onto trucks and quickly taken out of sight. The protest was thus brought to a halt almost as soon as it had begun. In this way, an attempt was made to contain the disruption, to restore the ruling regime of hierarchy and segregation, and to sew up the tear that the demonstrators had ripped in the symbolic universe. But while the protesters themselves could be forcibly removed from the scene, the images they left behind could not be so easily erased. Photographs of the demonstration were immediately published on the Internet and circulated on social media websites. Like apparitions from another dimension, these images demonstrate that another world is possible, a world without ethnic- or religious-determined divisions, a world without apartheid walls, security fences, or segregated streets. They show that the unthinkable can be made thinkable, that the invisible can be made visible, and that the impossible can be made possible. This staged news spectacle represents just one example of a larger trend. In Equality in the Shadows, I look at the role of film, media, and culture in the Palestinian struggle against Zionist colonization. Basing my dissertation on both Edward Said's notion of ""the Palestinian Idea"" and Jacques Ranciere's subversive redefinition of equality, I aim to show how through film and media, Palestinian liberation is not only a dream for a far-off and distant future but something that already exists in the present.

Sociology",Sociology,Avery F. Gordon,"West Bank Public Transportation: Movement as Politics is a study of mobility via public transportation as an important object of social struggle and the social mobilization that can result from creative engagements with transit. In Palestine, public transportation has and continues to be used as a way for Israeli occupation forces to impose social control on Palestinians. At the same time, Palestinians use transit in both intentionally political and quotidian ways to build connections and community despite the occupation's efforts to fragment Palestinian society. Against a shattered topography of walls, tunnels, gates, and checkpoints, transit becomes the stage on which battles for territorial sovereignty, social cohesion, dignity, and human rights play out. While scholars have written about the structural impediments to Palestinian movement and the social fractures that result, they have not focused specifically on transit as a strategic instrument for state imposition of separation and grassroots efforts to connect. I contribute such a focus on public transportation as both my direct object of study--I examine its characteristics, structures, and usages as a system--and as a lens through which to better understand the changing economic, political, and racial nature of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. Focusing on key episodes in the history of Palestine in which public transportation has played a significant role, I draw on critical theory, political sociology and social movements scholarship with international legal studies, cultural geography, and critical race theory. Based on ten months of mixed-methods fieldwork in Palestine, I present an analysis of the political dimensions of public transportation control and usage in the late Ottoman period (1892-1918), the British Mandate (1920-1948), the first Palestinian intifada (1987-1993), the Oslo years (1993-2000), the second Palestinian intifada (2000-2008), and the present-day West Bank. This socio-historical approach to the study highlights the value of transit for the imposition but also the bridging of geographic fragmentation in Palestine. An examination of mobility through the specific lens of transit reveals a uniquely nuanced picture of the strengths of state power as well as the limits imposed on it by popular mobility. My findings indicate that transit has been a useful tool in furthering various colonial and national aspirations over the last 120 years, enabling some and undermining others based on who exerts or subverts control over transit and how they do so. I relate my findings to international law to illustrate the importance of the universal human right to freedom of movement for the functioning of everyday life, how that right is routinely violated, and the ways in which people register explicit and implicit demands for that right to be restored. Finally, I argue that any productive resolution to the colonial affliction of Palestinian life must prioritize the unfettered mobility of Palestinians across Palestine.",Palestine,35.233154,31.952162,3

Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology","Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology",Steven Gaines,"While detrital material has been recognized as an important food source on coral reefs, its role in reef food webs remains unclear. We quantified detritus standing stock and flux rates to the detrital resource pool in two different habitats (exposed forereef and protected backreef) of Palmyra Atoll National Wildlife Refuge, while also measuring the trophic structure of the overlying fish assemblage. While the standing stock of detritus was 1.6 times higher on the protected backreef than the exposed forereef, input rates were 1.7 to 2.9 times higher on the forereef. These differences can be attributed to both variation in water motion and differential rates of biomass contributions to and removals from this resource pool. We found through stable isotope analyses of delta13C and delta15 N that benthic reef detrital composition is a combination of organic material from pelagic and benthic origins. However, detrital composition varied among reef habitats as would be predicted by spatial differences in the overlying reef fish assemblage. Planktivores were the most numerically abundant guild in the forereef habitat, and stable isotope signatures of detritus reflected a greater input from pelagic sources (i.e., depleted in 13C). In contrast, herbivores and detritivores numerically dominated the backreef habitat, and detrital stable isotope signatures appeared to be predominately of benthic origin (i.e., enriched in 13C). Through total organic carbon and nitrogen analyses we found that benthic detritus may represent a significant nutritional source to benthic communities. Converting total nitrogen into maximum protein estimates, we found high deposition of protein (104-124 mg m-2) and organic carbon (184-190 mg m-2 ) to the benthos, but very low standing stock amounts of these materials. While high water flow rates may explain low standing stocks of detritus in exposed forereef habitats, the lower flow rates in protected backreef habitats suggest that removal of this material is via consumption by abundant roving detritivorous fishes. Our results provide support for the hypothesis that reef fish detritivory represents a significant consumer-mediated energy pathway, promoting nutrient recycling by linking many elements of a complex food web.",Palmyra,-77.2333154,43.0639521,1

Comparative Literature",Comparative Literature,"Carl Gutierrez Jones, George Lipsitz","A comparative study of the relation between the poetics and the politics of racial disavowal and antiracism across national borders and literary traditions, this dissertation examines the rhetorical contours of colorblindness and their implications for contemporary Afro-Panamanian, Black South African, and Chicana/o literatures, and for the production of knowledge. I consider colorblindness as an ideology and discourse, as well as a metaphor for the global attempt to invisibilize ""the colorline,---the relation of the darker races to the lighter races of men in Asia and Africa, in America and the islands of the sea"" that W.E.B. Du Bois in The Souls of Black Folk (1903) identified as the ""problem of the twentieth century."" While the colorline persists, colorblindness poses a crucial obstacle to its removal in the twenty-first century. While much contemporary racial theory posits the novelty of the current racial order and the hegemonic discourse that sustains it, this study examines overlaps and continuities between colonial, overt white supremacist, and colorblindness discourse, as well as unforeseen affinities between particular colonial and decolonial imaginaries. In the process, it uncovers the rhetorical manifestations of what I call an epistemology of disavowal, and shows that colorblindness is not a new discourse. I argue that maintaining the centrality of the conceptual category colonialism is itself necessary if we are to understand the rhetorical contours of colorblindness and their far-reaching implications in the twenty-first century. Just as the current racial order displays striking continuities with the colonial past, entanglement also defines colorblindness, a pan-white discourse whose reproduction, as this dissertation demonstrates, transcends historical, national, linguistic, literary, disciplinary, and racial boundaries. Anchored in colonial relations, the rhetorics and logics that structure colorblindness form part of the archive and repertoire of white knowledge, which I define as a discursive formation and literary tradition shaping, and shaped by, the white supremacist canon. I also conceptualize white knowledge as racial consciousness. Tracing colorblindness from the Americas to South Africa, the study concurrently illustrates the transportability of the discourse across time and space, its contextual and geographical particularity, and its inextricability from deeply entrenched colonial epistemologies and ontologies.",Panama,-80.782127,8.537981,1

Applied Mathematics",Applied Mathematics,Paul J. Atzberger,"Biological membranes are complex mixtures of lipids, proteins, and other molecules that serve versatile functions within living organisms. The lipid membrane serves as the primary barrier between the cell and the outside world and serves within cells as the boundaries of organelles. Biological membranes play an important role in cellular functions through their many embedded proteins whose collective organization and functions depend importantly on the mechanical interplay with the lipid bilayer. To gain insight into biological processes requires an intrinsic understanding of the basic mechanisms by which inclusions such as proteins interact with the lipid bilayer structures. This has been an active area of research. We contribute through the development of new models and computational methods at both the level of continuum mechanics and at more mesoscopic scales where essential features of lipids are taken into account at a coarse-grained level to gain efficiencies over fully atomistic descriptions. We use these new approaches to perform a number of investigations of lipid bilayer membranes and protein interactions to gain new insights. First we introduce continuum methods at the level of individual proteins embedded within the bilayer in a manner closely related to the Immersed Boundary Method. We approximate the membrane-protein interaction by introducing a kernel function in the Hamiltonian that modifies the membrane energy in the neighborhood of the protein location. The proteins are naturally represented using a Lagrangian reference frame that tracks location while the membrane is represented using an Eulerian reference. In the same spirit as the Immersed Boundary Method, the kernel function serves to couple the Eulerian and Lagrangian representations without resorting to explicit boundary conditions. By approximating the interaction in this manner at the level of the Hamiltonian, a set of self-consistent forces are obtained that act to deform the membrane and to perturb the protein. As we shall discuss in more detail, we capture in our model the elastic mechanics of the bilayer, membrane tension, leading-order hydrodynamic interactions, and thermal fluctuations. For proteins that induce curvature, we show how the numerical approach has important consequences for the effective diffusivity of embedded proteins. We also provide a condition which ensures that the system satisfies detailed balance with respect to the Gibbs-Boltzmann distribution, which when analyzing prior work in the literature we find is often overlooked. This property turns out to be non-trivial in such approximate models since when both the protein and membrane simultaneously fluctuate important stochastic cross-terms are required that are difficult to treat. Some interesting features we can study with our methods include how collective effects arising from different area fractions of the embedded proteins impact the membrane bending mechanics. We find these can have a significant impact on the spectrum of bending fluctuations and on the renormalized flexural rigidity of the membrane bilayer sheet. In recent experiments by the group of Patricia Bassereau (Marie Curie Institute, Paris), protein diffusion within lipid bilayer membranes subjected to various levels of tension have been studied. By using quantuum dots, protein locations have been tracked at the single molecule level providing an ensemble of trajectories for different levels of tension. Interestingly, whethor tension effects diffusivity depends importantly on the level of apparent curvature a protein induces in the bilayer. We have collaborated with this research group to help understand these findings by performing simulation studies using our membrane-protein model and developing related theory. Overall, our modeling approach and computational methods are quite general and we expect they could be useful in the investigation of a wide variety of phenomena involving membrane-protein interactions. At the molecular level of description we have also investigated coarse-grained models for the lipid bilayer vesicle. Our description of the bilayer is based on the implicit-solvent coarse-grained (IS-CG) lipid model developed by Markus Deserno, Kurt Kremer, and Ira R. Cooke for equilibrium studies. We extend this work for studies of dynamic processes within bilayers by using the Stochastic Eulerian Lagrangian Method (SELM) to couple the coarse-grained model to fluctuating hydrodynamic fields. This approach provides a thermostat incorporating momentum-transfer from the the hydrodynamics of the surrounding solvent that would otherwise be missing in such implicit-solvent descriptions. In the past, the Deserno-Cooke IS-CG models have primarily been concerned with equilibrium properties of bilayers and used Langevin thermostats which neglect these effects. We have shown that by incorporating the hydrodynamics important correlations are manifested within the bilayer that could play an important role in many processes within the bilayer, such as the transport of proteins or the kinetics of self-assembly. To obtain continuum fields for comparison presents a number of challenges. We develop a fitting method for lipid bilayer vesicles based on the use of spherical harmonic (SPH) representation of the vesicle shape. We use the SPH representation to perform a spectral analysis of vesicle shape fluctuations.",Paris,2.3522219,48.856614,11

These three intellectuals were active writers during this period since they participated as translators, professors, and journal editors. As a result, their novels and creative essays were spaces where they extended theoretical reflections on literature. This dissertation counteracts the idea that Latin American intellectuals have not participated in the history of Literary Theory, which has been principally established by European intellectual's circles. Therefore, the main objective of this study is to lead scholarly attention to reassess the contributions of Mexican intellectuals to the Western history of ideas, and the role of Latin American intellectuals in the emergence of what we currently consider Literary Theory. This dissertation explores the period from 1968 to 1985, when there was an extensive production of Mexican novels and essays that show -albeit with unique characteristics- that Mexican intellectuals were engaged in active dialogue with French thought during the 1960s. Therefore I focus on the points of encounter and reception of ideas that were circulating in Paris at that time, and Mexican intellectuals' intervention of these topics, such as the polemic discussion about ""the death of the author"" and its consequences: the birth of the reader, the narrative construction that shows a mental process of the writer -which are core issues of the Western thought nowadays.",Paris,2.3522219,48.856614,11

Chicana and Chicano Studies",Chicana and Chicano Studies,"Miroslava Chavez-Garcia, Dolores I. Casillas","My research examines early twentieth-century immigration policies focusing on the experience of ""repatriation"" that tore apart Mexican and Mexican American families throughout the United States. It considers this historical moment as the ""banishment"" of U.S. citizens of Mexican descent to foreground the difference between repatriation, which implies that the person is not a citizen of a given country and banishment, referring to citizens who are banned from their home country. This discursive difference challenges much of the literature that refers to these banishments as ""repatriations"", obscuring the systematic racist and exclusionist immigration policies. The legal, social, and cultural ramifications of banishment on second and third generation descendants of U.S. citizens are largely absent in Chicana/o-Latina/o historiographies and immigration legal studies. My work takes an innovative approach in that it focuses on the prolonged consequences of immigration policies on surviving banished U.S. citizens and their descendants and the link to today's growing legally mixed-status households across the United States. My study demonstrates that U.S. immigration policies continue to ignore the long and complex Mexico-U.S. immigration relations, failing to create adequate paths to legalization for old and new generations of Mexican immigrants. This study centers on the experiences of banishment of three extended families and uses their oral histories across multiple generations to recover and rewrite the history of forced exclusion. The families are composed of surviving U.S. citizens who were banished during the early twentieth century and/or who are descendants of those survivors who have returned to the United States, some as undocumented immigrants. The participating families include the Yanez family, residing in Anaheim, California; the Molina family, spread throughout California, Alabama, and Mexico; and the Robles family, living in Pasadena, California. To allow for personal accounts as well as communal- or family-based interpretations, each family member is interviewed individually and then the entire family is interviewed collectively, providing for a multiplicity of insights and richly texture points of views. In addition to oral histories, this study mines the families' archives, which are composed of photographs, letters, and legal records detailing the experiences of banishment over the course of the twentieth century. Institutional records, including legal histories, archival materials, and demographic data housed at the National Archives in Washington D.C. and the regional branches in Los Angeles, California, as well as El Paso, Texas are used to contextualize the primary research and to reconstruct and reinterpret the immigration policies of the time. My study indicates that these families experienced repatriation in very unique ways, but with a common sense of contempt that extends across family generations, and continue to face real legal and social collateral consequences. My findings demonstrate that an almost 90-year-old unofficial, later becoming official, policy continues to classify direct descendents of banished U.S. citizens as ""illegal"" immigrants in their parents and grandparents' home country. Banishment has resulted in what I term, a transgenerational illegality, which has been nearly impossible to shake. These findings are crucial at a time where immigration remains central to national debates. The twenty original oral histories collected for this study demonstrate that, despite the subjugation of these families, the descendants found ways to challenge their ""illegal"" status, giving rise to the concept of a contested illegality..",Pasadena,-118.1445155,34.1477849,2

History",History,Ann Marie Plane,"This dissertation explores how California history museums represent the history of children and childhood. This work is inspired by earlier studies in the fields of anthropology, sociology, museum studies, and public history that question and analyze the underrepresentation or misrepresentation of groups, such as women and ethnic minorities, in US museums. How US museums represent children and their history has yet to receive scholarly attention. This dissertation contributes to filling this gap in the literature and bases its conclusions on a state-wide survey of more than 200 California museums, interviews with 110 museum professionals or volunteers, site visits to 40 museums, and in-depth field research at 10 museums. I argue that too often the experiences, stories, and contributions of children are overlooked, absent, or marginalized in California history museums. When representations of children's history do emerge, they often reflect ideals rather than realities, universalize the historical experience of childhood, and, in the process, romanticize the past. This dissertation acknowledges obstacles that get in the way of richer representation and offers potential solutions. During my study it became clear that multiple meanings of children's history are at work in the California museum community: the history of children, history for children, and history by children. This dissertation examines each in turn and demonstrates how conceptions of children, many with deep historical roots, influence not only museum exhibitions but also programming for children. Central to this dissertation is the study of history by children at the Pasadena Museum of History, which provides middle-school students the opportunity to teach history as docents to younger children. Drawing upon my three years of participant observation at this site and interviews with forty middle-school students, I contend that inviting children to participate, create, and co-produce in museum spaces improves children's attitudes towards museums, enriches representation, and brings to light perspectives that may otherwise remain marginalized.",Pasadena,-118.1445155,34.1477849,2

Earth Science",Earth Science,Andre R. Wyss,"The five new taxa described in this study are included in rigorous phylogenetic analyses of Interatheriinae and Hegetotheriidae (Typotheria, Notoungulata), providing new hypotheses of morphological evolution within these clades, and documenting independent yet apparently simultaneous radiations of interatheres and hegetotheres with ever-growing (hypselodont) dentitions. A significant majority of fossils from LdL are small-bodied taxa (e.g., rodents and typotherian notoungualtes) represented by dental and cranial elements. This size distribution is unusual compared to other well-known early Miocene faunas, and may reflect differential transport of skeletal elements in lahar-associated depositional settings. The high level of endemism across multiple SALMAs at LdL is also striking, particularly considering the geographic proximity of faunas from LdL with roughly coeval counterparts in neighboring regions of Argentina. The unique history of mammals in South America has long provided significant evolutionary and geological insights, but the continent's fossil record is strongly biased toward the lowlands of Argentine Patagonia. Recent collecting efforts in the Andean Main Range of Chile, near Laguna del Laja (LdL) (_37.5 S, 71 W), have yielded a stratigraphically superposed series of early to late Miocene fossil mammal assemblages, shedding light on the poorly known extra-Patagonian history of South American Neogene mammals. Several hundred specimens have been recovered from the Cura-Mallin and overlying Trapa-Trapa formations at LdL. Nearly all of these fossils were collected from a well-described stratigraphic sequence that includes 17 high precision 40Ar/39Ar ages. This robust temporal framework encompasses fossiliferous horizons spanning _20-9 Ma. This provinciality of the Andean faunas, relative to Argentine assemblages, likely reflects sampling of a regionally distinct and isolated paleoenvironment. Herein I provide a detailed account of the ungulates from the Cura-Mallin Formation at LdL; these range in age from _20-15 Ma (early to middle Miocene). Dentitions referred to Protypotherium praerutilum, a well-known but inadequately diagnosed species, motivated a long overdue (but preliminary) taxonomic revision. Occurrences of Protypotherium, Colpodon, and Astrapothericulus, together with radioisotopic ages, indicate that faunas spanning the Colhuehuapian and Santacrucian South American Land Mammal ""Ages"" (SALMAs) occur in direct stratigraphic superposition at LdL. These deposits have also yielded five new genera of typotherians (Notoungulata); this high level of endemism has also been noted among rodent faunas from LdL.",Patagonia,-110.7561963,31.5395378,2

The first section of this paper will discuss the conceptualization of corporate social responsibility and the value of corporate social responsibility to corporations. The next section explains why the apparel industry is a particularly sensitive topic in relation to corporate social responsibility and also why it has a considerable amount of potential for significant positive impact. This section will involve the conceptual development of three generations of corporate social responsibility strategy, introducing the notion of a ""Generation 2.5,"" which I argue could provide the future focus of corporate social responsibility in the apparel industry. Finally, I will discuss three case studies of major apparel companies, Nike, Gap, and Patagonia, which have a reputation for being at the forefront of innovation for corporate social responsibility strategies. The goal is to discover the significance of corporate social responsibility in the apparel industry for companies, consumers, workers, and all people with a stake in the operations of these companies.

History",History,Elizabeth DePalma Digeser,"This work argues that the presence of ""alchemical"" and ""magical"" material found in papyri dated to the third or fourth century CE must be related to the declining local aristocracy of the Roman empire and to their educated clients. Jacco Dieleman, Ian Moyer and mostly David Frankfurter, first described the Greek and Demotic Magical Papyri (part of the Anastasi papyri collection) as the work of Egyptian priests responding to the wishes of Greco-Roman aristocrats who traveled to Egypt in search of mageia . The conclusion of my work suggests two alternative modifications to the current interpretive framework: either (1) the Anastasi papyri were not solely the work of Egyptian priests but also of a social group of ""dependent scholars,"" men trained in Greek learning but economically dependent, and thus associated with a patron; or (2) from a socio-economic point of view, there was practically no difference between many late antique ""Greco-Egyptian priests"" and ""dependent scholars"" who used handbooks of recipes to maintain or promote the status of their patrons (alternatively the patrons could very well have used the books themselves). Persian philosophy (mageia) was a popular topic of study among late antique philosophers and we should expect ancient education to have generally accepted research on the magoi as a valid topic of inquiry (chapter one). A misunderstanding of the subject of ""magical"" study in turn pushed patrons to ask their dependent scholars for curses and divination (chapter two). Scholars (e.g. Apion ""Pleistonikes"") who were known as sorcerers were generally attached to patrons, involved in sympotic entertainment (esp. in the form of paignia) and in natural philosophy (chapter three). Comparing dependent scholars with each other shows that they read or wrote recipes that were considered to be magical by more established scholars (chapter four). The presence of paignia and of other performance-related recipes in the Anastasi papyri strongly suggests the kind of sympotic environment and of intellectual patronage referred to in the preceding chapters (chapter five). The same conclusion must be drawn a fortiori for P. Leid. and P. Holm., which are constituted of recipes for the counterfeiting of luxury items (chapter six).",Persia,53.688046,32.427908,2

Geography",Geography,Bodo Bookhagen,"Glaciers in the tropical Andes of southern Peru have received limited attention compared to glaciers in other regions (both near and far), yet remain of vital importance to agriculture, fresh water, and hydropower supplies of downstream communities. Little is known about recent glacial-area changes and how the glaciers in this region respond to climate changes, and, ultimately, how these changes will affect lake and water supplies. To remedy this, we have used 144 multi-spectral satellite images spanning almost four decades, from 1975-2012, to obtain glacial and lake-area outlines for the understudied Cordillera Vilcanota region, including the Quelccaya Ice Cap. In a second step, we have estimated the snowline altitude of the Quelccaya Ice Cap using spectral unmixing methods. We have made the following four key observations: First, since 1988 glacial areas throughout the Cordillera Vilcanota have been declining at a rate of 5.46 +/- 1.70 km2/yr (22-year average, 1988-2010, with 95 % confidence interval). The Quelccaya Ica Cap, specifically, has been declining at a rate of 0.67 +/- 0.18 km2/yr since 1980 (31-year average, 1980-2011, also with 95 % confidence interval); Second, decline rates for individual glacierized regions have been accelerating during the past decade (2000-2011) as compared to the preceding decade (1990-2000); Third, the snowline of the Quelccaya Ice Cap is retreating to higher elevations as glacial areas decrease, by a total of almost 300 m between its lowest recorded elevation in 1989 and its highest in 1998; and fourth, as glacial regions have decreased, 61 % of lakes connected to glacial watersheds have shown a roughly synchronous increase in lake area, while 84 % of lakes not connected to glacial watersheds have remained stable or have declined in area. Our new and detailed data on glacial and lake areas over 37 years provide an important spatiotemporal assessment of climate variability in this area. These data can be integrated into further studies to analyze inter-annual glacial and lake-area changes and assess hydrologic dependence and consequences for downstream populations.",Peru,-75.015152,-9.189967,8

History",History,Carol Lansing,"Throughout most of the twentieth century, historians of Medieval European Jewish communities overlooked the contributions of Jewish women to their families and to their communities. Recently, historians of northern European and Spanish Jews have begun to utilize notarial records to describe the financial activities of Jewish women in the Middle Ages. Yet few historians have utilized documents of practice to examine the activities of Jews in medieval or Renaissance Italy. Those few who have focus almost exclusively on the larger centers of Rome and Venice, which while important, do not represent the more typical and much smaller Jewish communities scattered throughout northern and central Italy in this period. This dissertation aims to address this oversight, and thus examines the economic roles played by Jewish women in the central Italian town of Perugia in the later Middle Ages and Renaissance. Notarial evidence reveals that by the fifteenth century, Jewish women not only possessed their own property, they managed it, alienated it, and gave it away as personal bequests in their wills. They also acted as heads-of-households in the absence of their husbands, and participated in decisions concerning family property, engaged publically in banking, and interacted with non-Jewish men in regards to business affairs. In Perugia, this was a new development. Why did it develop when it did? And what did this mean for women's position within their families and their community? By placing my analysis of these notarial records against the political backdrop of late medieval and Renaissance Perugia and within a discussion of normative rabbinic literature, I explore how this practice---female financial autonomy within the family---can be understood as a tool that aided the family's and community's struggle, and developed in response to a increasingly unstable political and social environment in Renaissance Perugia. Thus this study contributes not only to historians' understandings of this small yet important Jewish community, but also to our knowledge of the contributions Jewish women made to these communities, contributions that often far exceeded the expectations---or desires---of late antique and medieval rabbis.",Peru,-75.015152,-9.189967,8

Spanish and Portuguese",Spanish and Portuguese,Francisco Lomeli,"My dissertation uses an interdisciplinary approach to examine the representation of the crisis of the family in contemporary Latin American cinema of the first decade of the twenty-first century. I argue that the representation of the crisis of the family in certain postmodern Latin American films is a symbol of the effects of the violent transition to a globalized world put into practice by authoritarian regimes and dirty wars. The motif of incest -and in lesser extent, of parricide- is a polysemic narrative device that operates as a sign for the impossibility of representation of the historic events of the recent past, the effects of which emerge as a phantasmagoric (post)memory and discontent in the Latin American society of the present. The cinematic works I discuss include eleven recent films from Argentina, Chile, Peru, Brazil, and Mexico: the Peruvian films Ojos que no ven (2003) by Francisco Lombardi, Jose Mendez's Dias de Santiago (2004), and Claudia Llosa's Madeinusa (2006); Sebastian Lelio's La sagrada familia (2004), Pablo Larrain's Fuga (2006), and Tony Manero (2008) from Chile; the Argentinean Geminis (2005) by Albertina Carri, and Lucia Puenzo's El nino pez (2009); Matheus Nachtergaele's A festa da menina morta (2008) from Brazil; Ricardo Montreuil's La mujer de mi hermano (2005), a Mexican, Peruvian, and Chilean co-production; and Carlos Reygadas's Batalla en el cielo (2005) from Mexico. Based on this cinematic selection, I propose that the representation of the crisis of the family, which emphasizes the transgression of the incest taboo, and parricide as motifs or recurrent themes, is an allegory of the culmination of a crisis, and at the same time, operates as an allegory of a symptom and critical device of the homogenized values of the patriarchal order that has lost its legitimacy. The criticism of these values focuses on the different modes of articulation of the roles in the family in terms of class, ethnicity, gender and sexuality, which questions at the same time the foundation of modernity as a homogeneous system that the postmodern narrative defies and fragments. The transgression of the incest taboo as a fundamentally masculine act, is at the same time an excess of power, and indicates that what is at question here is the patriarchal discourse as a valid and endurable one in a more heterogeneous and multifaceted emerging postmodern society at the threshold of the new century.",Peru,-75.015152,-9.189967,8

I argue that despite their attempts to carve out private spaces---with varying degrees of success---the queer characters in these films are not able to escape the influence of the public sphere and heteronormativity. In Chapter Two, I examine the relationship between queer sexualities and city space. I argue that in Enrique Bochichio's El cuarto de Leo (Uruguay 2009) Montevideo is presented as a sort of utopia, a liberating space for individuals who may choose to come out of the closet. By conflating homosexuality with criminality, Marcelo Pineyro's Plata quemada (Argentina 2000), on the other hand, depicts the traditionally oppressive, unsustainable relationship between the city and homosexuals. In Chapter Three, I explore the use of the body as a space for working through issues of queer sexuality. In the films that I analyze, there is an increasing degree of materialization of the body as space. In Javier Fuentes-Leon's Contracorriente (Peru 2009), the ghost of the protagonist's dead lover serves as a sort of mirror that helps the protagonist cope with his sexuality. In Karim Ainouz's Madame Sata (Brazil 2002), issues of sexual identity, gender, race, and class are consolidated in the body of a cross-dressing performer. In Lucia Puenzo's XXY (Argentina 2007), the concern for the body as space is materialized to the greatest extent. The protagonist is an intersexed adolescent whose body serves as a space that represents not only her internal struggles, but also those of her parents and the society within which she does not neatly fit.",Peru,-75.015152,-9.189967,8

History",History,Carol Lansing,"Throughout most of the twentieth century, historians of Medieval European Jewish communities overlooked the contributions of Jewish women to their families and to their communities. Recently, historians of northern European and Spanish Jews have begun to utilize notarial records to describe the financial activities of Jewish women in the Middle Ages. Yet few historians have utilized documents of practice to examine the activities of Jews in medieval or Renaissance Italy. Those few who have focus almost exclusively on the larger centers of Rome and Venice, which while important, do not represent the more typical and much smaller Jewish communities scattered throughout northern and central Italy in this period. This dissertation aims to address this oversight, and thus examines the economic roles played by Jewish women in the central Italian town of Perugia in the later Middle Ages and Renaissance. Notarial evidence reveals that by the fifteenth century, Jewish women not only possessed their own property, they managed it, alienated it, and gave it away as personal bequests in their wills. They also acted as heads-of-households in the absence of their husbands, and participated in decisions concerning family property, engaged publically in banking, and interacted with non-Jewish men in regards to business affairs. In Perugia, this was a new development. Why did it develop when it did? And what did this mean for women's position within their families and their community? By placing my analysis of these notarial records against the political backdrop of late medieval and Renaissance Perugia and within a discussion of normative rabbinic literature, I explore how this practice---female financial autonomy within the family---can be understood as a tool that aided the family's and community's struggle, and developed in response to a increasingly unstable political and social environment in Renaissance Perugia. Thus this study contributes not only to historians' understandings of this small yet important Jewish community, but also to our knowledge of the contributions Jewish women made to these communities, contributions that often far exceeded the expectations---or desires---of late antique and medieval rabbis.",Perugia,12.3908279,43.1107168,1

Geography",Geography,David L. Lopez-Carr,"This study investigates land cover change and land ownership turnover in an area that is a priority conservation zone, the Sierra del Lacandon National Park (SLNP), Peten, Guatemala. Migration to Peten since the 1950s has eliminated 60% of Peten's forests. Migration to the SLNP peaked in the 1990s and population growth continues. This study analyzes panel-data consisting of household interviews conducted with farmers living in the SLNP or its buffer zone in 1998 and 2009. I examined household survey data previously collected during interviews conducted in 1998 with 247 subsistence farmers in eight communities. In 2009 I reinterviewed the same households when present. Additionally, I interviewed the new owners of land that had belonged to the 1998 interviewees, and a cross-sectional sample of 213 randomly selected households. Surveys were primarily quantitative, with some open-ended qualitative questions. I ran continuous regressions examining changes in land cover for households who remained in the area between the two dates. I also ran logistic regressions examining which 1998 landholding households had sold their land by 2009. The overall trend is towards deintensification of agriculture. On average, households crop larger areas of higher value crops and less maize, but these changes have not kept pace with the expansion of pasture. The area is simultaneously experiencing farm parcel consolidation and splintering. Half of the landowning households in 1998 sold their land by 2009, some to large landholders. The most commonly cited reason for a household to sell its land is for payments related to a medical emergency or debt. Early adopters of cattle and higher value crops were less likely to have sold their land by 2009. As in much of the lowland tropics of Latin America, pasture dominates the landscape. These findings illustrate that in areas of weak grain and produce markets, many households with the means to produce beyond basic subsistence will turn to cattle. In conservation areas of Latin America, park administrators would be advised to invest in developing land use alternatives to cattle, such as non-timber forest products.",Peten,-90.2996,16.912,1

Feminist Studies",Feminist Studies,Grace Chang,"My main research questions explore how contradictions of unity, organizing structures, gender, sexuality, citizenship, class, and ability are addressed within Filipino leftist organizations that utilize dialectical materialist theory. I also ask: How have US-based women of color feminist and queer of color theory impacted Filipino nationalist frameworks in the US? How do they also remain at odds with one another? I interviewed 21 NYC-based activists and organizers involved in anti-imperialist Filipino organizations the summer of 2012. I also used participant observation as an active member of study groups, educational workshops, and a town forum. My central framework explores conflict as contradiction using Mao Tse-tung's ""On Contradiction"" and the Haitian concepts of balans and konesans. In doing so, I examine how hard-lined leadership has impeded dialogue. I also interrogate how sexism, transphobia, masculinist organizing structures, and neoliberalism impact women, trans, queer, disabled, working class, and undocumented organizers---particularly those with overlapping identities of marginalization. ""The Movement's"" familial dynamic, combined with the value of utang na loob, creates hierarchies that cause some members to feel both silenced and guilty. I name these feelings as indicators of invisible emotional labor ""for the sake of the movement"" that lead many members to eventually leave their organizations. Their departures raise questions of sustainability. Lastly, I ask how the Fil-Am Left can draw strength from its familial dynamic but still address hierarchical issues that mirror societal hierarchies of oppression. Applying work by Patricia Hill Collins, Audre Lorde, and other women of color, along with feminist grounded theory and sociological movement theory, I highlight three strategies that New York City based Filipino organizations have taken within the past ten years. I argue that organizations have recognized problems with sustainability and are creating their own interventions as theory-producers. Organizers' relationships to the National Democratic movement in the Philippines shape both the creation of interventions and how they respond to new ideas. Drawing on Arlie Hoschchild's concept of ""stalled revolution,"" individual behaviors lag behind organizations' formal ideological shifts. Thus, they are works in progress.",Philippines,121.774017,12.879721,1

Marine Science",Marine Science,Libe Washburn,"Autonomous underwater vehicles (AUVs) like gliders are typically used to obtain vertical cross sections of water properties along transects. Another, less common, application is the use of gliders as virtual moorings. Gliders offer many advantages compared with conventional moorings, but extensive evaluation of gliders as mooring substitutes has not been done. Here, temperature and ocean current velocity data from coincidently deployed gliders-as- moorings and moorings are compared to assess the fidelity of glider-as-mooring data. The glider-as-mooring data were processed in a variety of ways and compared with mooring. During August 2012, two gliders sampled in a box pattern around a conventional mooring in 26 m water depth off of Pt. Sal, California for two and six days, respectively. Two box patterns were used, one 500 m on a side (two and four days) and the other 1 km on a side (two days). Temperature and velocity data from the gliders and moorings are compared using linear regressions and contouring techniques. Linear regressions show good agreement between glider and mooring temperatures (r2 = 0.89, p < 0.001). Significant correlations are also found between ADCP-derived velocities from the gliders and the mooring; along-shore velocities exhibit higher correlation (r2 = 0.70, p < 0.001) compared with cross-shore velocities (r2 = 0.37, p < 0.001). Glider versus glider comparisons are similar to glider versus mooring comparisons in the along-shore (r2 = 0.60, p < 0.001) and cross-shore (r 2 = 0.36, p < 0.001) directions. Temperature comparisons between gliders also show good agreement (r2 = 0.93, p < 0.001 ).",Point Sal State Beach,-120.6552713,34.9021013,1

While the salience of EU-level politics is low across most European states, its importance does vary from country to country. This dissertation project attempts to answer several questions concerning the relationship between EU-level politics and domestic political competition. First, how do debates about the European Union manifest in domestic politics? Second, how does nationalism influence how EU policies are discussed in domestic politics? In order to explore these questions this dissertation expands on our understanding of how fringe parties use nationalism to influence the salience of EU-level policies in domestic political competition. It argues that differences in nationalism influence the types of EU policies that fringe, anti-EU parties can argue as a threat to the national group in a way to increase their votes.

Chemical Engineering",Chemical Engineering,"Patrick S. Daugherty, Joseph A. Zasadzinski","Four key elements are conventionally recognized for an effective drug carrier: ""retain, evade, target, and release."" Liposomes have been developed that effectively retain drug within the interior, contain a polymer surface coating for extended circulation, and will passively accumulate at the tumor. However, retaining drugs, evading the body's defenses, and accumulating in tumors are not enough. The challenge still facing liposomal drug carriers is initiating and controlling drug release when desired, without compromising drug retention. We present a novel drug carrier consisting of a thermosensitive liposome coupled to a plasmonic nanoparticle. Continuous-wave irradiation by physiologically friendly near infra-red light at 800 nm generates heating localized to the liposome membrane. The heating increases the liposome permeability in an irradiation dose-dependent manner. Liposome permeability is enhanced through the inclusion of a small molar fraction of single-chained lipid, or lysolipid, resulting in rapid release of small molecules. This enables precise control of contents release with low temperature gradients confined to areas irradiated by the laser focus. Critical to this design is the ability to engineer a liposome with temperature-dependent membrane permeability. We describe the role of lipid structure on membrane transition from the less permeable solid gel to the more permeable fluid phase, and tune the membrane to undergo its transition at a temperature slightly above physiological. We demonstrate enhanced release achieved by the presence of lysolipid, and then present techniques for incorporating micellar-forming agents into pre-formed liposomes in order to synthesize large unilamellar vesicles. This gives us two distinct structures of hybrid liposome-nanoparticle drug carrier---small (200 nm) liposomes with nanoparticles tethered to the exterior surface and large (micron diameter) liposomes with nanoparticles encapsulated within the interior. We attach either hollow gold nanoshells or copper (II) sulfide nanoparticles to the liposome carrier, and then demonstrate rapid and controllable contents release due to the interconversion of light into heat by the nanoparticles. We further demonstrate release in response to localized nanoparticle heating, freeing the system from relying on regional hyperthermia. Finally, we use this system to deliver a common anticancer drug, doxorubicin, to prostate cancer cells in vitro and demonstrate enhanced cell killing.",Portugal,-8.224454,39.399872,5

History",History,Sarah Cline,"Portuguese merchant families migrated to New Spain (colonial Mexico) in the early 1600s when the crowns of Spain and Portugal were united from 1580 to 1640. At the beginning of the 1640s, immediately after Portugal successfully rebelled and gained independence from Spain, the Holy Office of the Inquisition in Mexico began to arrest and try en-mass a group of these now wealthy Portuguese merchants living in Mexico whom it suspected of secretly practicing Judaism. By 1642 there were 200 individuals being tried, most of them languishing in the secret prisons of the tribunal. Over the course of the 1640s the secret trials continued and culminated in a final public Gran auto de fe (act of faith) on April 11, 1649, in which the sentences of the accused were announced. In the most egregious cases secular authorities executed the convicted. This dissertation examines the lives of three of these crypto-Jewish families. The dissertation first considers the institutional history of the Holy Office of the Inquisition in colonial Mexico from its founding in 1571 to the 1640s. It examines the procedures and personalities of the tribunal throughout these trials based on correspondence between the tribunal and its superior court in Madrid Spain, the Suprema. The dissertation presents detailed case studies of three family clusters, the Enriquez Mendez and the Leon Jaramillo, both of which immigrated originally from Portugal, to Spain and then to colonial Mexico. The third cluster is a smaller family led by a single mother, Ana Enriquez, who along with her daughter Isabel immigrated from Spain to colonial Mexico and became part of the merchant elite described above. All members of these three families were tried during this period, but had very different circumstances. In all three families, however, there was a generational divide between the generation of those who emigrated and continued to faithfully practice their Judaism, and the next generation of their children, who did not practice Judaism as readily. Furthermore, those children identified more closely with the multi-ethnic setting and the Hispanic Christianity they found in colonial Mexico.

It is considered a textual milestone in Iberian historiography through its Old Portuguese and Old Castilian versions, and even through its reception in Catalan historiography from the Renaissance. This dissertation focuses on the history and circulation of the Cronica Geral de Espanha de 1344 based on archival research. This manuscript was most probably commissioned in Portugal around 1460 for Pedro, Constable of Portugal. In fact, the text of the Cronica offers an expansion probably used as a political maneuver that praises Pedro's royal dynasty and its place in the history of the Iberian realms. The manuscript itself is a relevant example of medieval transnationalism applied to manuscript circulation as cultural and social artifact, and its circulation throughout the centuries is the result of the historical and diplomatic connections between Portugal, Catalonia, and France.

Linguistics",Linguistics,Carol Genetti,"This thesis presents an analysis of the system of transitivity, voice and valency alternations in Huasteco of San Luis Potosi (Mayan) within a functional-typological framework. The study is based on spoken discourse and elicited data collected in the municipalities of Aquismon and Tancanhuitz de Santos in the state of San Luis Potosi, Mexico. The research presented here contributes to the typological understanding of valency and voice, as well as to the better understanding of these phenomena within the Mayan linguistic family. In this thesis a detailed morphological analysis of voice and valency in SLP Huasteco is set forth, together with a description of the intricate interaction between the lexical, morphological, syntactic and discourse level in the expression of events in this language. The thesis distinguishes between the lexical-semantic property of valency and the syntactic-pragmatic property of transitivity, which corresponds to a finer distinction between valency alternations and voice proper, and is reflected in the structural encoding of these phenomena. This thesis proposes a subcategorization of SLP Huasteco verbs based on their morphosyntactic behavior with respect to valency and valency alternations that in turn corresponds to their lexical semantic properties. The thesis considers verb roots and thematic suffixes to be central to the encoding of valency. It presents the encoding of valency alternations with ambitransitive roots as well as valency augmenting suffixes, mainly causatives and applicatives. This dissertation also describes the forms and functions of the antipassive and passive voices, and concludes that the Huasteco antipassive has the main semantic/pragmatic function of lowering the transitivity of the clause, whereas the passive has in most cases the syntactic/pragmatic function of putting the prominent topical third-person participant into the absolutive argument of the intransitive clause. In sum, this study shows that this intricate interaction between different levels of the structure is central to the understanding of the grammar of this language, and that fine distinctions in meaning and function correspond to finely nuanced grammatical forms.",Potosi,-65.7550063,-19.5722805,1

In the context of urban planning, these triggers hold vital information regarding the strength of land use policies and demographic shifts on individual responses to public investments in smart growth planning. This study describes a new approach to identifying drivers for change using the life-course behavioral framework to describe dynamics in task allocation over the individuals' lifetime. Using longitudinal travel behavior and land use data from the Puget Sound region, years 1989--2000, and latent growth modeling, the study finds that part of behavioral change is explained by yearly changes and part is explained by long-term planning and adaptation to changes in the household structure, such as having children. In addition to the study of individual behavior, the dynamics of the built environment are examined in the context of smart growth planning and the jobs-housing balance. Smart growth planning in the Puget Sound attempts to create a jobs-housing balance by intensifying and diversifying residents and businesses in 26 regional growth centers. The success of these planned centers to meet the jobs-housing needs is measured using commuting behavior of the center residents for 2010.

Global and International Studies",Global and International Studies,"Aashish Mehta, David Lopez-Carr","Through the context of the Punjabi agricultural development experience, this thesis examines the social, political, and economic implications of reforming India's current input subsidization strategy for agricultural developments. I conclude that changes are needed to allow for diversification in Punjab's agricultural sector and larger economy. Environmental, social and economic sustainability were not prioritized at the onset of the green revolution in Punjab and the adverse effects of input subsidies on the state exemplify this fact. Environmental degradation, human health complications, and fiscal deficits are visible in Punjab. Punjab has been the beneficiary of significant public investment funds for agriculture, allowing the state to become a cereal production powerhouse. Recently, however, the economic and agricultural growth enjoyed in Punjab has begun to stagnate, and may potentially be in decline, as continued input subsidization limits incentive for diversification. The prioritization of the agricultural sector of the economy has led to limited growth in the secondary and tertiary sectors where further diversification could allow for more non-farm employment opportunities. Changes to the state agricultural support structure were limited during the reform period of the 1990's, but a reduction in input subsidies could allow more holistic and equitable rural development in India by shifting government funds toward investment in education, infrastructure, and agricultural research and development. Ultimately, a gradual reduction of input subsidies, coupled with the utilization and enforcement of minimum support prices, could lead to more diversification within the agricultural sector. Agricultural extension services through the Punjab Agricultural University need to be highly engaged in the transitional period to inform farmers of their options for diversification. The fiscal savings realized through a reduction in input subsidies could allow for government investment in long term growth, improving urban and rural Punjabi livelihoods and could serve as a case study for burgeoning African nations to follow.",Punjab,75.3412179,31.1471305,1

Global and International Studies",Global and International Studies,Richard Appelbaum,"As billions of dollars are being invested in construction, construction workers are the physical driving force behind the UAE's infrastructural development and overall growth. Despite being an integral component to decreasing the dependence on oil rents and diversifying the economy through construction, workers in this industry are severely mistreated. This study seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of workers' rights in the construction industry in the UAE. The central research question framing this study is: what are the labor violations faced by workers and to what degree has the UAE government responded to these issues? The follow up questions are then, have working conditions improved and what are the challenges in improving these conditions? This study employs a qualitative approach, drawing on current literature in order to answer the central research questions. The discussion in this paper is based on an analysis of the information collected through archival research and is divided into 7 chapters. The penultimate chapter of this thesis features a case study of Abu Dhabi's $27 billion megaproject, Saayidat Island, which is home to the new Guggenheim, Louvre, and New York University (NYU) satellite campus. This current case study will be used in order to examine the status of workers' rights violations and the level of enforcement of government policy on labor issues. After a review of government policy on labor, this paper concludes that the UAE does not lack legislation on labor issues, but rather lacks enforcement of these laws. Thus, this study finds that the largest hurdles to enforcing labor laws is the level of crony capitalism between the government and the construction industry and the disposability of labor. This study hypothesizes that the partnerships Abu Dhabi is building with big international names at Saayidat Island, like the Guggenheim and Louvre museums and also universities like New York University, may serve as a tipping point and bring more international scrutiny to violations of workers' rights in this industry. The hope is that mounting international pressure, as seen in Qatar leading up to the 2022 World Cup, will encourage the UAE to go beyond responding to these issues at the institutional level and motivate them to enforce the labor laws on the ground. In the 1960s the United Arab Emirates (UAE) struck oil. Over the years, the UAE has increasingly invested in an array of sectors to reduce economic dependence on hydrocarbon exports. All sectors that the UAE is actively investing in, are not only global but require infrastructure development. Between the Emirates of Dubai and Abu Dhabi there are currently about 1,300 construction projects in development worth over $418 billion (Sonmez et al., 2011). The Emirates lack the domestic labor force required to support these construction endeavors. For this reason, the UAE is largely dependent on migrant labor.",Qatar,51.183884,25.354826,2

I challenge the dominant narrative that the international community has failed to intervene in Syria, by pointing to the manifold government-funded arms transfers to opposition groups beginning in 2012. I find that there are two significant networks of arms trafficking: one through Jordan with Saudi Arabian and American support; the other through Turkey with Qatari support. These patterns and rivalries between donor countries have contributed to three processes within the transformation from revolution to civil war: militarization, increased sectarianism, and fragmentation of the opposition. I review two mechanisms of international arms control: multilateral embargoes and the recent Arms Trade Treaty. Their weaknesses, as evident in the case of Syria, are related to the problems of self-monitoring and enforcement by states that have contradictory incentives. Next, I address the related issue of surplus arms by looking at how the failure of disarmament measures in Iraq and Libya had a direct impact on arms proliferation in Syria. I conclude with a discussion of the legality of arms transfers to non-state actors and the need to focus on political rather than military solutions to globalized conflict.",Qatar,51.183884,25.354826,2

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Susannah M. Porter,"Phosphatized and phosphatic small shelly fossils are a major source of information about Cambrian animal evolution, but many remain enigmatic, both with regard to their phylogenetic affinities and the overall morphology of the animal from which they came. Four studies on these fossils are presented. First, Cambrothyra is a jar-shaped fossil that has often been interpreted as a protistan test, but a detailed redescription based on specimens from the lower Cambrian of southern Shaanxi Province, China, supports the identification of it as the sclerite of a coeloscleritophoran, a problematic group of Cambrian scleritome-bearing metazoans. In particular, Cambrothyra resembles chancelloriids, but differs from them in having simple rather than compound sclerites. Second, results are presented on large samples of chancelloriid sclerites from the Meishucunian of eastern Yunnan Province, China (Dahai Member, Zhujiaqing Formation, and Shiyantou Formation). The material from the Dahai Member appears to come from a single species, while statistical analysis of morphotype co-occurrences in different samples suggests that at least four species are present in the Shiyantou Formation. The species from the Dahai Member is among the oldest well-characterized chancelloriids, and the irregularity and poor organization of its sclerites compared to those of younger forms support the hypothesis that chancelloriid sclerites are compound structures arising from the fusion of originally separate elements. In the third study, two further fossils are described from the Xihaoping Member: a cap-shaped fossil with a spine on its lower surface, and Acidocharacus, a tall spine, often bearing barbs, attached to a rounded conical base. Both of these fossils appear to be sclerites and may have functioned as attachment sites for soft tissues, but their affinities remain unknown. Finally, new microstructural data are presented for hyoliths, a group of problematic calcareous fossils, based on material from the middle Cambrian Gowers Formation of Queensland. These preserve a lamello-fibrillar microstructure reminiscent of both some molluscs and some annelids. Because of the convergent evolution of lamello-fibrillar microstructures in different groups of animals, it does not offer clear support for any particular phylogenetic position for hyoliths; instead, this plywood-like microstructure probably evolved to strengthen the shell against predators.",Queensland,142.7027956,-20.9175738,1

Global and International Studies",Global and International Studies,Aashish Mehta,"Ecuadorian member organizations of the transnational social movement La Via Campesina won legal recognition of the state's responsibility to guarantee one of their central demands, food sovereignty, or the people's right to determine their agri-food systems and the extent to which this right can be exercised, in that country's 2008 constitution and 2009 food sovereignty law. These victories came after decades of uprisings by rural and indigenous social movements resulted in the election in 2006 of Ecuador's populist president, Rafael Correa, who denounced neoliberalism and made the alternative development paradigm of buen vivir (or ""living well,"" from the Kichwa sumak kawsay) a central part of his Citizen's Revolution. Academic literature in the wake of these developments has focused on the ideas of plurinationality and ecologically sustainable development embodied in the concept of buen vivir (Davalos 2009, Escobar 2010, Cobey 2012, Oviedo 2014), analysis of state-social movement interaction in institutionalizing the food sovereignty policy regime (Pena 2013), and participation in this process by urban consumer movements (Van Ongeval 2012). Nevertheless, research into the praxis of food sovereignty and buen vivir by rural communities themselves remains limited. In order to address the dearth in academic literature on these topics and investigate the gap between food sovereignty in principle and in practice, this project takes an action research approach to investigate practices of food sovereignty in three communities of the Sierra region of Ecuador. Specifically, the questions of 1) how practices of food sovereignty mesh with or contradict state policy and social movement rhetoric, 2) how such practices inform the notion of buen vivir as an alternative development strategy, and 3) the extent to which an action researcher can contribute to the food sovereignty of the communities being studied are addressed. These are addressed via the researcher's participant observation at the invitation of each community as a participant on a multicultural exchange program sponsored by the Quito-based NGO Huayra Causay, for whom the researcher interned for a period of six months. The study finds positive outcomes such as mobilization for grassroots land reform, collaboration with multinational NGOs for targeted investment in irrigation infrastructure and the creation of community governance for its oversight, and partnership with municipal governments to promote rural producer's associations with direct marketing opportunities such as farmer's markets. However, significant obstacles still remain, such as contradictory policy, high rate of return conditionality for state investment, and intransigence of the national assembly in the participatory legislative process for food sovereignty, making the notion of buen vivir a still-distant ideal for the communities studied.",Quito,-78.4678382,-0.1806532,2

Sociology",Sociology,"Kum-Kum Bhavnani, John Foran","Shifts in national political and cultural identity were fueled by popular projects of interculturalism whereby linguistic, ethnic, and ideological differences were encouraged and openly observed. As of 2007, the Ecuadorian constitution officially acknowledges the concept of mother earth as a living being. It also recognizes Pachamama worldview concepts such as sumak kawsay, or well-being, as underpinnings of a sustaining way of life. Better chances at self-determination and communal development became available during these social shifts in Ecuador. As migration to Quito and other large cities continued in this century, ayllu networks grew dramatically in predominantly mashi districts like San Roque, just south of Old Town Quito. Political mobilization by Ecuadorian mashikuna or indigenous pueblos and nations culminated nationwide in the 1990 uprising whereby the Ecuadorian president was overthrown. This political maneuver was orchestrated by coalitions of different sectors of Ecuadorian society. Mashikuna national networks mobilized effectively to block transportation and commerce, backed by mestizo elite and working sectors, and military leadership, with the help of rank and file. Rising national discontent with neoliberal policy implementation in the late 1980's fueled alliances against corrupted political leadership. To understand the everyday practice of Pachamama worldview is essential to understand Ecuadorian indigenous identity and political mobilization in the 21st century. Sumak kawsay provides political, spiritual and economic support for ayllus that are have no government support. The importance of sumak kawsay in the life of mashikuna explains their unwavering resistance against neoliberal projects of individualism and the destruction of the environment for profit. Despite migration to urban centers, outside cultural and technological influence, religious shifts, and continuing racism, mashi continue to live in solidarity with one another, according to the Pachamama worldview. The San Roque network in Quito is an example of how Ecuadorian urban ayllu networks acculturate while maintaining a core identity that entails complex political and economic ties. San Roque provides mashi ayllu networks a degree of autonomy to develop influential political, economic, and spiritual coalitions according to their sumak kawsay. An autonomous space to practice it has always been available to mashikuna for it is essential to their continuance and identity. However, in the 21st century ayllu the practice of sumak kawsay, mashi identity, and their resistance against inequality takes place within an empowered position unparalleled in recent history.",Quito,-78.4678382,-0.1806532,2

Through Bandura's self-efficacy framework (2005) and its effect on two key generational cohorts of women advocates, much can be learned about those women leaders advocating for the rights of Saudi businesswomen. My focus on self-efficacy of these two Generational Cohorts came from a pilot study (Alfrayan, 2013) on the self-efficacy component of leadership among Saudi businesswomen in three main regions in Saudi Arabia, Riyadh, Jeddah, and the Eastern province. The pilot study yielded evidence of the existence of two distinct Generational Cohorts among the Participants. The two Generational Cohorts are characterized by the event of the establishment of a women section that provided services to businesswomen. It is important to note that different geographic regions established women sections at their local chamber of commerce on different dates. Thus, the generations are not defined by time, but by context. Focus is given to how these leaders describe the development of their self-efficacy and what they chose to do with it. For the purpose of this study, the Generational Cohorts of the Participants were added as a dimension to understand how self-efficacy compares between generations. Using a Quantitative case study approach to closely studying six cases of two generational cohorts in three geographical locations was preformed.

Geography",Geography,Naomi L. Tague,"This dissertation explores ecohydrologic interactions in western U.S. catchments using a process-based model. My research focuses on understanding how model estimates of two key components of the hydrologic budget, evapotranspiration and streamflow, are influenced by soil and vegetation physiological characteristics in three watersheds. These watersheds are located in the Oregon Cascades, California Sierra Nevada, and Colorado Rocky Mountains. Water availability in these systems is driven on a first order by annual precipitation. The majority of their precipitation is received in the winter and their forests are generally water-limited in the summer. However, they differ in the magnitude of annual precipitation received, the fraction of winter precipitation received as snow, and their seasonal energy demands. The response of these ecosystems to inter-annual climate variation is also a function of soil storage and ecophysiological characteristics. I will present research motivated by three research questions. How do soil characteristics and climate interact to influence forest water availability? How do uncertainties in forest ecophysiology, carbon allocation strategy, and their interaction effect mature forest carbon and streamflow estimates? Finally, how do climate and carbon allocation strategy influence the rate of forest growth and streamflow recovery following disturbance? I use a physically-based model, the Regional Hydro-Ecologic Simulation System, to address these questions. Results indicate that the influence of soil storage on evapotranspiration's sensitivity to climate drivers varies across sites. In the Sierra Nevada and Cascades, low soil storage increases the sensitivity of annual ET to climate drivers. Evapotranspiration in Colorado, which is water-limited but has a summer monsoonal pulse, is not sensitive to changes in soil storage. Estimates of forest carbon sequestration differ significantly between three carbon allocation strategies in mature (100-300) forests. Biomass estimates for leaf and fine root pools were strongly sensitive to allocation strategy and ecophysiological characteristics in the Sierra Nevada watershed. Streamflow estimates in this drier watershed are also more sensitive to vegetation ecophysiology. I show that the effect of allocation strategy effects estimates of recovery in forest LAI and streamflow more than climate variability at al three sites.

I will delineate the growth and consolidation of these early mining communities that in essence were industrial colonies and then examine Mexican and Mexican American's participation in and shaping of the culture, values, institutions, and shared experiences of the mining camps. This is followed by a discussion of the lives of Mexicans in relation to other ethnic mine camp dwellers, all of whom lived in the ""foreign"" section of the camps. The welfare of mine camp households was contingent upon miner's wages. The shared experiences of day-to-day survival drew mine camp residents together into tight community networks. Mine companies dominated politics and society; however, trade unionism and radical politics likewise distinguished the mining camps and enriched community life. Socialists frequently visited the camps, and the Industrial Workers of the World were leading activists who inspired the miner and their families to militancy and added to outbursts of radical activism. I draw on strike actions in southern and northern Colorado from the 1880s to the 1920s to illustrate my argument, particularly the 1914 Ludlow Massacre and the 1927 Columbine Coal Strike.",Rocky Mountain,-94.7674486,35.8053663,2

Chemical Engineering",Chemical Engineering,Jacob N. Israelachvili,"Dopa (3,4-dihydroxyphenylalanine), a post-translational modification from tyrosine (Tyr), features prominently in the mussel foot proteins (mfps), ranging from less than 5 mol % in mfp-4 to 30 mol % in mfp-5. The binding ability of the mfps to different substrates has been mostly attributed to the Dopa functionality in the protein and the role of the other peptide residues in the adhesive properties of the protein remains elusive. Here we have discovered that the adhesion between mfp-1 decapeptide films ([AKPSYPPTYK]2) and mica remained unchanged with or without the Dopa residue. This is a paradigm shift in our understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying adhesive properties of the mfps and calls for further inquiry into the effects of peptide residues beyond Dopa chemistry. We also developed a systematic body of work linking the adhesive performance to lengths and architectures of peptides. Dopa in a peptide sequence does not necessarily lead to the formation of cross-links between peptide films through metal chelation, and the length of the peptide is a crucial parameter for enabling metal ion mediated bridging between surfaces. More recently, we have been working on designing and characterizing small molecules that mimic the properties of the adhesive mussel foot proteins. The wet adhesion and coacervation of an adhesive protein (mfp-5) was recapitulated in an order of magnitude smaller length scale which shows cohesive properties superior to the mfps. We believe that the resulting insights into the molecular structure-function relationships will enable rational design of synthetic bio-inspired adhesives that would enable de novo (suture less) sealants for injuries and surgeries and nano-scale-adhesive applications in the semiconductor industry. Biological systems have developed elegant adaptations during its evolution to survive and perform its functions efficiently under specific environmental constrains with enormous physical demands. In this dissertation, I make an effort to understand tribological phenomena in biology and translate them into a synthetic system for engineering applications. I emphasize on adhesion, friction and lubrication in three different biologically inspired soft condensed matter as described below. Geckos can attach and detach their toes reversible in matters of milliseconds from most surfaces regardless of its roughness due to the hierarchical structure of their foot-pads. Micro-flaps mimicking the function of the micron sized setae on the gecko foot pad were fabricated and investigated for its adhesion and frictional properties in a modified surface forces apparatus (SFA). A Johnson-Kendall-Roberts (JKR) model with an effective stiffness and adhesion energy parameters quantitatively described the 'contact mechanics' of the tilted micro-flaps against a smooth silica surface at the macro and micro-scales. Constant attachments and detachments occurred between the surfaces during shearing and were described by an Avalanche mechanism. These results demonstrate the significance of preload, shearing velocity, shearing distances, commensurability, and shearing direction of gecko-mimetic adhesives and provide a simple model for analyzing and/or designing such systems. Biolubrication systems show ultralow friction coefficients, remarkable wear resistance properties and are far superior to any artificial system designed to date. In this work, the role of proteins (e.g., Lubricin, Lub) and polysaccharides (e.g., Hyaluronic acid, HA) found in articular joints, and mfp-1 inspired coacervates were investigated to determine the lubrication and wear protection mechanisms conferred by the naturally occurring polymers to a mica surface. We find that Lub penetrates into a chemically bound HA on mica to form a visco-elastic gel that reduces the coefficient of friction as well as boosts the strength of the surface against abrasive wear, however, physically adsorbed HA-Lub complex were poor at conferring wear protection to mica even though it showed low friction coefficients. Similarly, coacervated mfp-1/HA rescues mica from shear induced damage only when the protein is modified with Dopa, which is responsible for attaching the coacervate to the surface. Absence of Dopa resulted in severe abrasive wear to the surfaces even under low loads (< 10 mN) during shearing. These results show that strong anchoring of polymers is crucial to protect surfaces from shear induced damage. We also demonstrate that friction coefficient is not correlated to wear.",Romania,24.96676,45.943161,2

Using a wide range of interdisciplinary methods, this dissertation is the first to consider the important role of Hercules at the intersection of healing, landscape, and imperial expansion dynamics. It addresses a number of case studies of naturally occurring thermal mineral healing sites in the provinces with primary associations to the hero-god Hercules, located in Numidia, Gaul and Greece, and Dacia, while examining a wide range of material, including sculpture, numismatics, inscriptions, and small finds. Important for understanding the formation of Roman identity, Ad Mediam -- an ancient curative sanctuary of thermal springs located thirty miles from Trajan's bridge into Dacia (roughly modern day Romania), like other healing sites, supported transprovincial networks and served as important arena of cultural, social, religious, and political transmission in the Roman Empire. Through an analysis of space, dedicatory activity, representation strategies, and the natural environment, past interpretations regarding the significance of material culture in the context of healing sites are here reconsidered. Engaging with later historiography, this dissertation strives to integrate a variety of objects and material culture more typically treated separately in the specialized literature in order to challenge assumptions about the homogeneity of Roman ""provincial"" material culture and to explore the importance of stylistic variety, objects' use values, and the importance of the natural and built landscape in the formation of Roman identity.",Romania,24.96676,45.943161,2

Sketching the problems night posed to masters, I argue that slaveholders were more concerned about where their slaves were than keeping them busy. Because masters desired to keep their human property accessible at all hours, many slaves spent their nights inactively confined. The fourth chapter examines how beds marked Roman identity. Where one slept separated the civilized from uncivilized, the rich from the poor, and the manly from the effeminate. This dissertation explores nighttime in Ancient Rome. Although several monographs on the history of night have appeared in the last two decades, no one has focused on antiquity. Through the examination of literary sources from the second century BCE to late antiquity from histories, biographies, plays, novels, laws, art, archaeology, and theological treatises, this dissertation examines how Romans experienced and thought about night. Chapters one and two argue that night intensified emotions. The first chapter examines how Romans constructed the nocturnal soundscape. The change from day to night altered the meaning of some sounds. Other sounds induced more anger, fear, excitement, and even divine transcendence than they did during the day. The second chapter explores a reoccurring complaint Romans made about nighttime: it imprisoned them.

History",History,Carol Lansing,"Throughout most of the twentieth century, historians of Medieval European Jewish communities overlooked the contributions of Jewish women to their families and to their communities. Recently, historians of northern European and Spanish Jews have begun to utilize notarial records to describe the financial activities of Jewish women in the Middle Ages. Yet few historians have utilized documents of practice to examine the activities of Jews in medieval or Renaissance Italy. Those few who have focus almost exclusively on the larger centers of Rome and Venice, which while important, do not represent the more typical and much smaller Jewish communities scattered throughout northern and central Italy in this period. This dissertation aims to address this oversight, and thus examines the economic roles played by Jewish women in the central Italian town of Perugia in the later Middle Ages and Renaissance. Notarial evidence reveals that by the fifteenth century, Jewish women not only possessed their own property, they managed it, alienated it, and gave it away as personal bequests in their wills. They also acted as heads-of-households in the absence of their husbands, and participated in decisions concerning family property, engaged publically in banking, and interacted with non-Jewish men in regards to business affairs. In Perugia, this was a new development. Why did it develop when it did? And what did this mean for women's position within their families and their community? By placing my analysis of these notarial records against the political backdrop of late medieval and Renaissance Perugia and within a discussion of normative rabbinic literature, I explore how this practice---female financial autonomy within the family---can be understood as a tool that aided the family's and community's struggle, and developed in response to a increasingly unstable political and social environment in Renaissance Perugia. Thus this study contributes not only to historians' understandings of this small yet important Jewish community, but also to our knowledge of the contributions Jewish women made to these communities, contributions that often far exceeded the expectations---or desires---of late antique and medieval rabbis.",Rome,12.4963655,41.9027835,10

Religious Studies",Religious Studies,Rudy V. Busto,"This dissertation utilizes a defendant-centered approach to the study of religion and law as a way to understand religious communities whose practices have been criminalized. Rather than asking about the legality of laws criminalizing religious practice, this dissertation asks how religious individuals and communities negotiated competing claims of authority over their religious practice. Shifting the analysis to the defendants increases our understanding of the development and, in some cases, escalation of conflicts between religious communities and the state. This approach also helps us to see how these conflicts are catalysts for change not only in the teachings and practices of the religious community but also in the construction and enforcement of the law. Drawing on archived trial transcripts, letters, local newspapers, and taped interviews, this dissertation analyzes the criminalization of the Ghost Dance among the Lakota in 1890, the fraud trials of the leaders of the ""I AM"" Activity in the early 1940s, and the criminal prosecutions of serpent handlers in the 1940s and 1970s in order to address why some religious practices are criminalized while others are not. Each case study represents one of the three groups most commonly targeted with criminal laws: Native Americans, metaphysical movements, and Christian sects. Each case study is also chosen from one of the three eras when the criminalization of religious practice peaked: the Gilded Age and Progressive Era, the Roosevelt administration, and the counterculture of the 1960s and 1970s. The comparative nature of this project highlights the ways groups are treated differently by the government based on their proximity to white, normative understandings of religion. By defining an action as criminal, the government articulates the limits of tolerance, marks the frontier of the abnormal, places a value on conformity, and encourages an optimum behavior toward which all should strive. Therefore, by investigating criminal prosecutions of religious practitioners, we gain a better understanding of the shifting boundary between deviant criminal activity and constitutionally protected religious practice as well as the role of the state in policing this boundary and reinforcing hegemonic understandings of ""normal"" and ""abnormal"" religion.",Roosevelt,-103.3587288,33.9538388,1

In addition to a detailed longue duree qualitative exploration of the process by which Soviet policies fostered deeply ingrained national identities that became powerful organizing tools in the post-Soviet era, this work also pursues a quantitative examination of demographic data compiled by the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union and the post-Soviet states to show that ethno-national homogenization of territory in favor of the titular nationalities was a process that began long before the violence and acts of ethnic cleansing that occurred with the fall of the USSR and that these demographic changes correlate with the different periods of implementation of nationalities specific policies.",Russia,105.318756,61.52401,9

Global and International Studies",Global and International Studies,Alison Brysk,"This study attempts to examine the extent and limits of democracy following periods of intense conflict, as it asks the question: how much democracy is possible post-conflict? The genocide in Rwanda in 1994 left the international community watching for the emergence of a democracy in the fragile nation in the years following. Tackling these challenges required intense political commitment to the ideals of democracy, although this form of democracy came with certain limitations on ""rights"" and allowances, namely in terms of freedom of speech, that in turn inhibited various individuals, groups, and media outlets from having an active voice in the political process. These acknowledged trade-offs were initially enforced to inhibit residual tensions and bring about progress and country-wide rehabilitation and peace, but this same limited form of democracy is still present today, to the detriment of Rwanda's development. By looking at governmental power through the use of the courts, restrictive election procedures, and the further marginalization of Rwanda's Twa population, the current political situation in Rwanda shows how this same form of post-conflict democracy also has the potential to be wielded as a authoritarian political tool that imparts dangerous rights limitations and notions of second-class citizenship through policy, laws, and interactions with the international community. Rwanda's government has embarked on a campaign of repression and censorship of the population that prevents the expression of dissenting political opinions, uses fear to gain compliance, and prevents the recognition of unique concerns facing the indigenous communities along the borders. Unless the current administration is held accountable for addressing the numerous rights limitations inherent in Rwanda's current democracy, the danger of re-instating authoritarian rule is very real.",Rwanda,29.873888,-1.940278,2

Through oral historical narratives, royal rituals, colonial accounts, and local and family histories I reveal a social order in flux, and a monarchical system increasingly dependent upon intimate kinship relationships. Within this context, I argue that the power of the King, relative to the Queen Mother and other intimates, waned when faced with the innovations of joint rulership.

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Jordan Clark,"The current drought crisis in California highlights the vulnerability of freshwater resources, particularly groundwater reservoirs, which supply up to 60% of California's water during drought years. Understanding the potential impacts of climate change on groundwater recharge and storage is critical as drought periods become more frequent in the state. Groundwater residence times provide insight into groundwater recharge and transport mechanisms and storage capacities. This study developed and evaluated a new intrinsic tracer method to quantify groundwater recharge and transport using the occurrence of the naturally-produced radioisotope sulfur-35 (35S, half-life 87.5 days) in water as dissolved sulfate (35SO4). Improvements made to established analytical techniques expand the analytical range of 35SO4, which broadens the utility of 35SO 4 as a hydrologic tracer. The 35SO4 tracer method was applied to two distinct hydrologic settings: 1) high-elevation Sierra Nevada basins, and 2) low-elevations basins containing managed aquifer recharge (MAR) facilities. In the Sierra Nevada study, the new 35SO4 method was used to empirically constrain annual groundwater recharge in Sagehen Creek Basin (SCB) and Martis Valley Groundwater Basin (MVGB). Compared to relatively high 5SO4 activity in seasonal snowmelt (5.5 +/- 0.3 to 52.9 +/- 3.4 mBq/L), groundwater and surface water consistently yielded low 35SO4 activities resulting in a calculated percent new snowmelt (PNS) of <30%. The consistently low PNS suggests that recent (<1 year old) snowmelt represents only a small fraction of the larger aquifer system. As snowpack continues to decline due to climate change, streamflow and springs may respond in a two phase manner: rapid response in discharge followed by more gradual decreases over decades due to declines in groundwater recharge. The MAR study used 35SO4 to quantify groundwater travel times near MAR operations. MAR sites divert excess surface water, imported water, and reclaimed wastewater into surface-spreading ponds or direct injection wells to replenish groundwater in heavy-usage areas. Identifying groundwater travel times near MAR facilities is critical for determining the fate and transport of potential contaminants, especially for facilities that incorporate a significant portion of reclaimed wastewater. Successful application of the 35SO4 tracer method near MAR sites is dependent on careful characterization of the 35SO4 activity in source waters. Relative to established deliberate tracer experiments, which require extensive field and laboratory effort, the less intensive 35SO 4 technique showed comparable groundwater travel times at two MAR facilities located in southern California. Both the Sierra Nevada and MAR studies demonstrate that 35SO4 is a valuable, yet underutilized tracer in hydrologic studies.",Sagehen Creek Basin,-120.2410591,39.4320694,1

Global and International Studies",Global and International Studies,"Paul Amar, Jan N. Pieterse","Over the last 10 years, religiously fueled conflicts have been on overdrive. The new wave of Pentecostalism in Bahia, Brazil is gaining strength. The Igreja Universal do Reino de Deus stands as a religious behemoth in the city center of Salvador. It is a golden palace displaying its clear economic might, political power and influence over public morale, surrounded by the mushrooming impoverished hillsides of the disempowered masses. In its effort to distinguish cosmologies in a world of religious syncretism and Catholic hegemony, the Evangelical Church depends on demonizing Candomble, an African-Diasporic religion. Candomble has had a long history of oppression and discrimination in Brazil and early scholarship surrounding Candomble has always linked it to represent a traditional Afro-Brazilian identity. However, Candomble no longer represents nostalgia to the colonial past but rather an alternative modernity. This paper explores the effects of demonization of Candomble in Salvador, Bahia Brazil by analyzing the current interactions between state/govt. agencies, the Evangelical movement, and the Candomble community as they penetrate public morale, the booming tourist industry, and ultimately negotiate Brazil's new identity. Furthermore, as a result of this conflict, rising new alliances show that Candomble is not a fragile religion in danger of extinction but has instead entered the playing field of global religions fighting for legitimacy, popularity and acceptance. Lastly, this research suggests that sustaining religiously fueled conflicts amongst the Afro-Brazilian community is ultimately a political tool that destabilizes progress towards a unified movement against similar structural social problems.",Salvador,-38.5014136,-12.9722184,4

History",History,Randolph Bergstrom,"The Public History of a Concentration Camp: Historical Tales of Tragedy and Hope at the National Stadium of Chile does this and, in doing so, contributes to the stadium camp's history in unique ways. A public history lens provides fresh perspectives on the production of historic work at and memories of the National Stadium-as-concentratin camp over forty years (1973-2013). Its focus on popularly constructed narratives' interaction with official silences and versions demonstrates both how and why stadium stakeholders---especially from the residual---have constructed the tales of tragedy and hope. As it focuses on this popular historical work The Public History of a Concentration Camp has focused, too, on the formative power of the specific place in the formation of public memory. Rather than begin with selected processes or events and look for places where they unfolded and happened, this study gains insight from joining public and popular practitioners who begin at a specific place and ask: what happened here? The unique public and place-based approach also joins recent conversations concerning historic sites of conscience not only in Chile but worldwide. Framing the popular historical work at the stadium generally and its complicated human rights museum 'National Stadium, National Memory' specifically against the backdrop of the sites of memory in Chile offers context for local interpretation of human rights as much as the reciprocal relationship between these organic understandings and international conventions. The Public History of a Concentration: Historical Tales of Tragedy and Hope at the National Stadium of Chile continues this important historical trajectory in the form of a scholarly monograph, only made possible through the popular work that has preceded it. On September 11, 1973, forces of evil converted the National Stadium of Chile into a concentration camp. That day, the nation's military and security forces overthrew the constitutionally elected government of President Salvador Allende Gossens. For the next fifty-eight days thousands of Chileans and hundreds of foreigners experienced violations of human dignity, physical integrity, and political consciousness. The stadium became the physical and figurative starting point for seventeen years of state-sponsored terrorism under the regime of Augusto Pinochet. Today, though, this is hardly a secret, as stories of the stadium-as-concentration camp have circulated since 1973 to the present in testimonies and memoirs, truth commissions and international reports, newspaper and media accounts, documentaries and movies, and ephemeral commemorations and permanent memorials. At different times, in different ways, and for different reasons, former stadium prisoners, human rights activists, journalists, judges, state officials, and scholars have sounded off, sometimes in a complementary fashion, other times to clash. Despite the volumes of searchable material (books, memoirs, testimonies) and less tangible but equally telling commemorative events (vigils, theater productions, public art) that continue at the stadium, no single work has attempted to synthesize, organize, and analyze this historic corpus.",Salvador,-38.5014136,-12.9722184,4

Sociology",Sociology,William I. Robinson,"Policing the Wretched examines the transnationalization of systems of racism, class exploitation, criminalization, militarized policing, and social control throughout North and Central America in the late twentieth and early twenty-first century. It provides a sociological, historical, and materialist analysis of the militarization of the Los Angeles Police Department, the policing of youth and surplus labor populations in El Salvador, the so-called ""war on drugs"" in Mexico, and the emergence of hip hop as a cultural form of expression in the heavily policed Pico Union district of Los Angeles to conceptualize what I call ""transnational apparatuses of social control"". It demonstrates that during the epoch of global capitalism, repressive nation-state apparatuses have taken transnational dimensions. It shows that these forms of social control should be understood alongside neoliberal policies such as structural adjustments programs (SAPs) and free trade policies, and the proposed ""wars"" on drugs, crime, gangs, terrorism, and anti-migrant policies in this region. It illustrates that the transnationalization of social control emerged as a response to social and economic crises that have developed from neoliberalism, racial and social inequality, and the emergence of grassroots social movements. While remaining attentive to the repressive apparatuses of social control in a transnational context, Policing the Wretched also examines how social movements in Los Angeles, Mexico City, and San Salvador have contested neoliberal policies, security initiatives, and militarization. Through interviews, participant observations, and archival research (government documents, congressional reports, and studies; presidential addresses; media sources and journalist accounts; and non-governmental literature, studies, and research) spanning three countries, the project traces the ways in which social movements in the U.S., Mexico, and El Salvador have mobilized and waged a relentless struggle over hegemony that provides an alternative social warrant that places democracy over securitization and human rights over property rights. It concludes by showing how hip hop in Los Angeles delineates acritique of transnational social control and a culture of resistance. The three different sites (Los Angeles, Mexico City, and San Salvador) exemplify the linkages of transnational methods of social control and opposition during the epoch of global capitalism.",Salvador,-38.5014136,-12.9722184,4

It builds accounts of the functioning of bodies and minds ""from the bottom up,"" or from physical materials upward to mental phenomena, and of media technologies ""from the top down."" In so doing, it synthesizes and draws contrasts between numerous contemporary theories of the mind and theories of media.

It asserts the relevance of John Dewey's aesthetic philosophy to contemporary media theory and shows how extended cognition provides a valuable tool for understanding user-media interactions.

Parts II and III illustrate how media are capable of participating in phenomena such as perception, cognition, and memory. Through discussion of films such as What Time is it There? (Tsai Ming-liang, 2001) and videogames including Don't Look Back (Terry Cavanagh, 2009) and Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas (Rockstar Games, 2004), these parts contend that meaning occurs neither in the media text itself nor in the brain of the user, but rather in the interactions between users and media. This dissertation ultimately asserts that media go beyond shaping or influencing mental activity---rather, they play constitutive roles in it. This claim prompts a reconsideration of the roles that the humanities can play in interdisciplinary research, as well as a call for an increased emphasis on what hermeneutic scholarship offers the study of the mind.",San Andreas,-119.6755697,35.1361246,1

Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology","Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology",Carla D'Antonio,"The meta-analysis showed negative effects of non-native plant invasions on arthropod richness, which are in part determined by the abundance of the invader, and are greatest at high levels of invader abundance (70% cover or greater). My field research showed that these effects vary by site, season, and sampling technique/stratum, and are apparently modulated by the characteristics of both the invader and the invasion itself, including growth patterns, litter production, invader abundance, and native plant diversity. Even a relatively small amount of Carpobrotus edulis has negative effects on arthropod abundance, richness, and composition, with an exponential decrease in abundance and richness and a shift in composition well before 50% Carpobrotus cover. Changes in feeding guilds and composition helped to suggest the drivers of these patterns, and revealed a particularly strong effect on fossorial arthropods, likely related to the dense rooting structure of Carpobrotus. Thus, while the negative effects of non-native plant invasions typically increase with increasing invader cover, the form of this relationship is determined by the attributes of both the invader and the invaded system. For my dissertation work, I asked what effect non-native plant invasions are having on entire arthropod assemblages, and how that effect is related to the degree of invasion. I further asked how the responses by component feeding guilds contribute to these relationships. I answered these questions by conducting a meta-analysis and review of existing studies, then investigating the effects of one invader, Carpobrotus edulis, on coastal dune arthropods at four different coastal California sites. At Vandenberg Air Force Base, Montana de Oro State Park, and San Buenaventura State Beach, I utilized unmanipulated Carpobrotus populations to compare paired invaded and uninvaded patches and to investigate a gradient of Carpobrotus infestation. At Coal Oil Point Reserve, I conducted an experimental restoration trial, removing varying amounts of Carpobrotus and re-vegetating with native dune plants. Invertebrate responses to plant invasions can help delineate the drivers of biodiversity and community patterns, thus guiding the conservation and restoration of diverse native ecosystems. Although it is well known that invasive species have pervasive effects on native communities and ecosystems, our knowledge of the relative contributions of, and interactions among, key factors determining invader impacts is limited. Among potentially key factors is invader abundance, but few studies have examined its relationship to community structure. Those studies have shown varying relationships between invertebrate assemblages and invader cover, illustrating the need for additional studies on the forms and mechanisms of relationships between invertebrate biodiversity and invasive plant abundance.",San Buenaventura State Beach,-119.2782,34.269,1

Geography, Joint Program SDSU","Geography, Joint Program SDSU",Douglas A. Stow,"Southern California shrublands are threatened by nonnative European annual grasses, which contribute to substantial fragmentation and loss of these ecologically important communities. Both natural and anthropogenic disturbances provide opportunities for competitive exotic herbaceous species to colonize in gaps in shrublands and overtake native grasses and shrubs. Remote sensing using moderate resolution imagery can provide a spatially comprehensive, cost-effective, and repeatable approach to monitor the establishment and expansion of nonnative herbaceous cover into sensitive habitats, and provide the potential for detecting native herbaceous cover where it occurs in high fractions. The underlying goal of this study is to better understand the temporal, spectral, and spatial characteristics of herbaceous vegetation in California shrublands in the context of effectively mapping and monitoring herbaceous vegetation cover using remote sensing methods. Chapter 2 provides the details of the phenological response and spectral properties of native and nonnative herbaceous cover, based on plot-based fieldwork conducted in CSS habitat in the San Diego National Wildlife Refuge (SDNWR). High temporal resolution field spectroscopic data were shown to be useful for determining when native and nonnative herbaceous vegetation in CSS are most spectrally separable in the course of a growing season. In Chapter 3, intraannual remote sensing methods are explored to map herbaceous cover fraction in shrublands. Optimal discernment of herbaceous cover was found using single-date imagery timed in the early summer months (early June in 2010); fractional cover of growth forms was mapped with errors of 0.08 or less. Chapter 4 investigates the stability and reliability of cover fractions modeled using a multitemporal remote sensing approach. MESMA applied to three dates (2008, 2010, and 2011) of SPOT imagery was used successfully to model growth form fractions over a large extent of shrubland vegetation with low individual and overall error. Findings from this study indicate that MESMA applied to moderate resolution imagery timed to maximize spectral differences between growth forms is an effective approach for quantifying changes in fractional cover that exceeds ten percent, providing a way to delineate and quantify herbaceous invasions and expansions following disturbance or succession.",San Diego,-117.1610838,32.715738,16

Geography, Joint Program SDSU","Geography, Joint Program SDSU",Li An,"Traditional spatial analysis and data mining methods fall short of extracting temporal information from data. This inability makes their use difficult to study changes and the associated mechanisms of many geographic phenomena of interest, for example, land-use. On the other hand, the growing availability of land-change data over multiple time intervals and longer time frames, often based on satellite imagery, presents to land-change study a great opportunity, given that this information can be effectively utilized. This methodological gap highlights the need to better understand the analytical challenges brought by temporal complexities, and to investigate alternative analytical frameworks that could handle those challenges. This dissertation attempted to achieve three goals: 1) finding metrics to capture temporal trends, 2) dealing with temporally imprecise data due to constraints of frequency, duration, and starting time of data collection, and 3) handling variables with time-changing values. A simulated land-change dataset based on an agent-based model of residential development and an empirical dataset from two case study sites in San Diego and Tijuana were used for this investigation. Results from the simulation dataset indicated that the survival function and the hazard function are important metrics to reveal temporal trends. In general the results of land-change analysis are sensitive to time frequency, in particular when time-dependent variables are also present. Longer duration benefits land-change analysis since longer durations contains more information. However, time-dependent variables with measures over a long period are more difficult for detection, which may pose a challenge. Starting time also affects the analytical results because the level of process uncertainty varies at different starting times. Findings from real world data mostly agree with those from computational data. Time dependent variables present a major challenge in land-change analysis, and survival analysis can better handle time-independent variables and thus better forecast urban growth.",San Diego,-117.1610838,32.715738,16

Geography, Joint Program SDSU","Geography, Joint Program SDSU",Douglas A. Stow,"This dissertation explores the readiness of remote sensing science, in terms of methodological prescription and theory, to address time-sensitive information requirements. It synthesizes and evaluates predominant conceptualizations of remote sensing and critically evaluates them in terms of their ability to inform the design of remote sensing systems to address time-sensitive information requirements, presents a novel conceptual model of remote sensing based in information theory, and demonstrates the evaluation and updating of a remote sensing system to meet the time-sensitive information requirements of wildfire managers in California. In chapter 2, current conceptualizations of remote sensing are found lacking in their ability to inform the optimization of remote sensing systems for application to time-sensitive phenomena because they omit several factors affecting the timeliness of information delivery. Characteristics of a conceptual remote sensing model appropriate for time-sensitive remote sensing are identified; such a model should: (1) conceptualize the collection of technologies used to acquire, process, and distribute remote sensing information as a single system that can be optimized; (2) acknowledge that remote sensing exists to inform decisions; (3) recognize that the decision maker (i.e., user) and information are both fundamental to the effectiveness of such decisions; and (4) account for tradeoffs between the type, reliability, and timeless of information produced by remote sensing systems. The Fields of Operations Research, Decision Science, and Systems Theory are highlighted as likely sources for methods and theory on the optimization of remote sensing systems to meet the needs of specific users and user groups. Chapter 3 presents a conceptual model of remote sensing as a communication system for the transmission of information; the remote sensing communication model. The mathematical model of communication from engineering, broader philosophical perspectives on the nature of information and communication, and the map communication model are used to conceptualize remote sensing a communication system, explain the production, communication, and ingestion of remote sensing information, and to estimate the timeliness of information delivery by remote sensing systems. The remote sensing communication model places remote sensing within a decision support context, where the effectiveness of a decision and the subsequent value of an information product is dependent upon both the qualities of the information (e.g., timeliness, accuracy) and the nature of the decision process (e.g., user bias, technical expertise, cartographic proficiency). The conceptualization of remote sensing as a communication system permits the estimation of sensor, channel, and receiver capacity. Methods for the estimation of sensor, channel, and receiver capacity are outlined, but further research into the reliable estimation of both human and automated receivers is warranted. Chapter 4 applies the Remote Sensing Communication Model (RSCM) to improve a tactical wildfire remote sensing system to better meet the time sensitive information requirements of emergency response managers in San Diego County, USA. A thermal infrared airborne remote sensing system designed and operated by the United States Forest Service Pacific Southwest Research Station for active wildfire monitoring is documented and updated based on the RCSM. Analysis of the thermal infrared remote sensing system in the context of the RSCM identified three configuration changes that can improve the effectiveness of the information produced when employed by wildfire incident commanders for suppression prioritization: (1) limit spectral sampling collection to a single waveband; (2) complete image processing steps onboard; and (3) provide information on wildfire locations to incident commanders in the form of a static map. Collectively, this research evaluates current theoretical and methodological approaches to the design of RSSs using a structured approach and proposes a novel conceptual model of remote sensing grounded in geographic and information theory. It explores and highlights the issues and challenges presented by the use of remote sensing to fulfill time-sensitive information requirements, defines a common vocabulary for their discussion, and provides methods for the systematic evaluation and design of RSSs to address time-sensitive information requirements. Going forward, it would seem that the fields of Operations Research, Decisions Science, Systems Theory, and Software Engineering could make significant contributions toward the development of both theoretical and practical approaches to the design of remote sensing systems to address time-sensitive information requirements. The limited operational use of remote sensing to address time-sensitive information requirements and collective finding of this dissertation suggest that the development of RSSs for specific time-sensitive applications (e.g., wildfire response, earthquake response, oil spill response) and response areas, such that those preconfigured RSSs can be activated during an appropriate event and provide appropriate information products that are easily employed by decisions makers, is likely the only way to ensure the effective use remote sensing in a hazard response context, and likely time-sensitive applications in general.

Geography, Joint Program SDSU","Geography, Joint Program SDSU",Douglas A. Stow,"ABSTRACT An Analysis of Tree Mortality Using High Resolution Remotely--Sensed Data for Mixed--Conifer Forests in San Diego County by Mary Pyott Freeman The montane mixed--conifer forests of San Diego County are currently experiencing extensive tree mortality, which is defined as dieback where whole stands are affected. This mortality is likely the result of the complex interaction of many variables, such as altered fire regimes, climatic conditions such as drought, as well as forest pathogens and past management strategies. Conifer tree mortality and its spatial pattern and change over time were examined in three components. In component 1, two remote sensing approaches were compared for their effectiveness in delineating dead trees, a spatial contextual approach and an OBIA (object based image analysis) approach, utilizing various dates and spatial resolutions of airborne image data. For each approach transforms and masking techniques were explored, which were found to improve classifications, and an object-based assessment approach was tested. In component 2, dead tree maps produced by the most effective techniques derived from component 1 were utilized for point pattern and vector analyses to further understand spatio-temporal changes in tree mortality for the years 1997, 2000, 2002, and 2005 for three study areas: Palomar, Volcan and Laguna mountains. Plot--based fieldwork was conducted to further assess mortality patterns. Results indicate that conifer mortality was significantly clustered, increased substantially between 2002 and 2005, and was non--random with respect to tree species and diameter class sizes. In component 3, multiple environmental variables were used in Generalized Linear Model (GLM--logistic regression) and decision tree classifier model development, revealing the importance of climate and topographic factors such as precipitation and elevation, in being able to predict areas of high risk for tree mortality. The results from this study highlight the importance of multi--scale spatial as well as temporal analyses, in order to understand mixed--conifer forest structure, dynamics, and processes of decline, which can lead to more sustainable management of forests with continued natural and anthropogenic disturbance.",San Diego,-117.1610838,32.715738,16

Geography, Joint Program SDSU","Geography, Joint Program SDSU",Fernando J. Bosco,"This dissertation focuses on the spatial organization and operation of immigrant day-labor markets, as well as the socio-spatial relationships between hiring sites and their surrounding neighborhoods that sometimes generate serious community conflicts. The primary purpose of this research is to reduce or eliminate day-labor conflicts at the local level through improved urban planning, community building and education, and improved communication networks among laborers. The geographic perspective is critical for this analysis, as planning for day labor activities requires understanding how the markets work at multiple spatial scales. This dissertation project uses geographic information systems (GIS) and quantitative analysis in combination with qualitative research methods to explore the geography of day labor markets in the San Diego Metropolitan Area. Specifically, it examines the distribution and locational characteristics of day labor hiring sites and the neighborhoods that support them. Each day in the SDMA, approximately 1000 men look for work at one of the forty-five total day labor hiring sites located within the region. There is considerable diversity within the day-labor population; some hiring sites are used almost entirely by recent migrants to the area, while others are used by long-time residents of a variety of backgrounds. The diversity of day laborers increased as a result of the economic downturn that began in 2006; the lingering effects of which are still visible at the time of publication in 2012. Laborers across the region employ a locational strategy termed ""strategic visibility"" in their selection of hiring site locations, as well as their organization within day-labor spaces. Strategic visibility maximizes employment opportunities and accessibility to employers, while avoiding undesired attention and/or visibility. The fact that day labor hiring sites are located in neighborhoods where employment opportunities are greatest - those with high levels of employment in construction and agriculture, as well as higher than average numbers of owner-occupied homes - is evidence of this strategy at the regional scale. This regional and neighborhood-level analysis is combined with street-level observation and ethnography to understand the ways that spaces of work and social reproduction are informally constructed, maintained, and altered by day laborers and other community members. The processes that generate day labor conflicts are particularly important for this study, and the analysis in this dissertation finds that so-called day labor conflicts often arise due to local crises that are unrelated to day-labor activities. Furthermore, the actions taken by local governments and community groups to try and control day labor activities are costly and largely ineffective. This dissertation demonstrates the importance of everyday urban rhythms on day labor activities and the ways that negotiations for control of space connect laborers and local stakeholders to each other and to particular hiring sites. Only by acknowledging these relationships and processes that connect laborers to particular spaces and incorporating them into day-labor support efforts, can local government and community groups implement policies that protect laborers and ensures that day-labor activities do not inhibit other community members from using urban spaces in the most productive manner as well.",San Diego,-117.1610838,32.715738,16

MESMA applied to three dates (2008, 2010, and 2011) of SPOT imagery was used successfully to model growth form fractions over a large extent of shrubland vegetation with low individual and overall error. Findings from this study indicate that MESMA applied to moderate resolution imagery timed to maximize spectral differences between growth forms is an effective approach for quantifying changes in fractional cover that exceeds ten percent, providing a way to delineate and quantify herbaceous invasions and expansions following disturbance or succession.",San Diego,-117.1610838,32.715738,16

Geography, Joint Program SDSU","Geography, Joint Program SDSU",Li An,"Traditional spatial analysis and data mining methods fall short of extracting temporal information from data. This inability makes their use difficult to study changes and the associated mechanisms of many geographic phenomena of interest, for example, land-use. On the other hand, the growing availability of land-change data over multiple time intervals and longer time frames, often based on satellite imagery, presents to land-change study a great opportunity, given that this information can be effectively utilized. This methodological gap highlights the need to better understand the analytical challenges brought by temporal complexities, and to investigate alternative analytical frameworks that could handle those challenges. This dissertation attempted to achieve three goals: 1) finding metrics to capture temporal trends, 2) dealing with temporally imprecise data due to constraints of frequency, duration, and starting time of data collection, and 3) handling variables with time-changing values. A simulated land-change dataset based on an agent-based model of residential development and an empirical dataset from two case study sites in San Diego and Tijuana were used for this investigation. Results from the simulation dataset indicated that the survival function and the hazard function are important metrics to reveal temporal trends. In general the results of land-change analysis are sensitive to time frequency, in particular when time-dependent variables are also present. Longer duration benefits land-change analysis since longer durations contains more information. However, time-dependent variables with measures over a long period are more difficult for detection, which may pose a challenge. Starting time also affects the analytical results because the level of process uncertainty varies at different starting times. Findings from real world data mostly agree with those from computational data. Time dependent variables present a major challenge in land-change analysis, and survival analysis can better handle time-independent variables and thus better forecast urban growth.",San Diego,-117.1610838,32.715738,16

Stow,"ABSTRACT An Analysis of Tree Mortality Using High Resolution Remotely--Sensed Data for Mixed--Conifer Forests in San Diego County by Mary Pyott Freeman The montane mixed--conifer forests of San Diego County are currently experiencing extensive tree mortality, which is defined as dieback where whole stands are affected. This mortality is likely the result of the complex interaction of many variables, such as altered fire regimes, climatic conditions such as drought, as well as forest pathogens and past management strategies. Conifer tree mortality and its spatial pattern and change over time were examined in three components. In component 1, two remote sensing approaches were compared for their effectiveness in delineating dead trees, a spatial contextual approach and an OBIA (object based image analysis) approach, utilizing various dates and spatial resolutions of airborne image data. For each approach transforms and masking techniques were explored, which were found to improve classifications, and an object-based assessment approach was tested. In component 2, dead tree maps produced by the most effective techniques derived from component 1 were utilized for point pattern and vector analyses to further understand spatio-temporal changes in tree mortality for the years 1997, 2000, 2002, and 2005 for three study areas: Palomar, Volcan and Laguna mountains. Plot--based fieldwork was conducted to further assess mortality patterns. Results indicate that conifer mortality was significantly clustered, increased substantially between 2002 and 2005, and was non--random with respect to tree species and diameter class sizes. In component 3, multiple environmental variables were used in Generalized Linear Model (GLM--logistic regression) and decision tree classifier model development, revealing the importance of climate and topographic factors such as precipitation and elevation, in being able to predict areas of high risk for tree mortality. The results from this study highlight the importance of multi--scale spatial as well as temporal analyses, in order to understand mixed--conifer forest structure, dynamics, and processes of decline, which can lead to more sustainable management of forests with continued natural and anthropogenic disturbance.",San Diego,-117.1610838,32.715738,16

Geography, Joint Program SDSU","Geography, Joint Program SDSU",Fernando J. Bosco,"This dissertation focuses on the spatial organization and operation of immigrant day-labor markets, as well as the socio-spatial relationships between hiring sites and their surrounding neighborhoods that sometimes generate serious community conflicts. The primary purpose of this research is to reduce or eliminate day-labor conflicts at the local level through improved urban planning, community building and education, and improved communication networks among laborers. The geographic perspective is critical for this analysis, as planning for day labor activities requires understanding how the markets work at multiple spatial scales. This dissertation project uses geographic information systems (GIS) and quantitative analysis in combination with qualitative research methods to explore the geography of day labor markets in the San Diego Metropolitan Area. Specifically, it examines the distribution and locational characteristics of day labor hiring sites and the neighborhoods that support them. Each day in the SDMA, approximately 1000 men look for work at one of the forty-five total day labor hiring sites located within the region. There is considerable diversity within the day-labor population; some hiring sites are used almost entirely by recent migrants to the area, while others are used by long-time residents of a variety of backgrounds. The diversity of day laborers increased as a result of the economic downturn that began in 2006; the lingering effects of which are still visible at the time of publication in 2012. Laborers across the region employ a locational strategy termed ""strategic visibility"" in their selection of hiring site locations, as well as their organization within day-labor spaces. Strategic visibility maximizes employment opportunities and accessibility to employers, while avoiding undesired attention and/or visibility. The fact that day labor hiring sites are located in neighborhoods where employment opportunities are greatest - those with high levels of employment in construction and agriculture, as well as higher than average numbers of owner-occupied homes - is evidence of this strategy at the regional scale. This regional and neighborhood-level analysis is combined with street-level observation and ethnography to understand the ways that spaces of work and social reproduction are informally constructed, maintained, and altered by day laborers and other community members. The processes that generate day labor conflicts are particularly important for this study, and the analysis in this dissertation finds that so-called day labor conflicts often arise due to local crises that are unrelated to day-labor activities. Furthermore, the actions taken by local governments and community groups to try and control day labor activities are costly and largely ineffective. This dissertation demonstrates the importance of everyday urban rhythms on day labor activities and the ways that negotiations for control of space connect laborers and local stakeholders to each other and to particular hiring sites. Only by acknowledging these relationships and processes that connect laborers to particular spaces and incorporating them into day-labor support efforts, can local government and community groups implement policies that protect laborers and ensures that day-labor activities do not inhibit other community members from using urban spaces in the most productive manner as well.",San Diego,-117.1610838,32.715738,16

Anthropology",Anthropology,Michael A. Jochim,"Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) data was collected from 200 individuals from CA-SCL-38 (Yukisma Mound), hereafter referred to as SCL-38 as well as 102 additional burials from 15 other archaeological sites in the region to test for a relationship between direct maternal kinship (i.e., genetic relatedness as revealed by mtDNA), grave goods, and burial patterns. This was ultimately done to determine whether spatial patterns at SCL-38 are associated with the emergence/maintenance of social differentiation and inferred social inequality. These data were additionally used at the inter-site level to explore the hypothesized spread of Penutian populations and to document genetic continuity in the San Francisco Bay area through time. Reconstruction of regional North American prehistory has benefited from the incorporation of ancient DNA evidence. However, few studies focus on intra-site genetic variation, associate these relationships to mortuary assemblages, or link these variables to social ranking. The Late Period (900 BP-250 BP) in the San Francisco Bay area witnessed shifts in settlement patterns that included mortuary treatment distinct from earlier periods. The change in mortuary pattern is interpreted either as a reduction in social inequality, a shift toward corporate group identity based on kinship, or an emergence of a lesser number of differentiated elites with control over high status resources. Results indicate that maternal relatedness is not correlated to the spatial distribution of burials within the cemetery. Additionally, no associations are noted between particular mtDNA haplotypes and burials with high quantity or diversity of grave goods. Thus, the overall placement of burials at SCL-38 are random with respect to direct maternal relationships. However, regardless of mortuary assembleges, there are some subgroupings within the cemetery of individuals related at the maternal level. The heterogenous distribution of mtDNA lineages across the spatial extent of the site may instead reflect its use as a regional cemetery for select, perhaps wealthy elite, individuals who originated from the surrounding Bay area. It remains possible that patterning along the paternal line or the lack of temporal refinement is confounding other underlying genetic structure. Across the landscape, however, mtDNA lineages are identified that correspond with the hypothesized influx of Proto-Utian (Penutian) speakers into the San Francisco Bay area by the end of the Early Period and beginning of the Middle Period. Additonal haplotypes are also identified that are probably older than 7,000 BP in the region, most likely representing maternal lineages orignally belonging to ancestral Hokan speakers. Most mtDNA haplotypes discussed represent at least 2,000 years of genetic continuity in the region.",San Francisco,-122.4194155,37.7749295,7

Global and International Studies",Global and International Studies,Eve Darian Smith,"Since WWII, the human rights movement has both evolved and expanded, but it has remained focused on belief that ""all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights,"" as exemplified in Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights. Yet, despite the importance of these rights, the United States is party to only 12 of the 27 articles that have been identified as ""most central to the spirit and goals of the Charter,"" every one of them subject to conditions. It is for this reason that this paper examines the barriers to the ratification of human rights law in the United States and seeks to address the question: can the local incorporation of human rights law at the city or state level offer an alternative to its failure to be ratified at the federal level? In order to answer this question, the existing literature on human rights and American exceptionalism will be analyzed in the context of the diffusion of global norms to the local level to better understand how the San Francisco Convention for the Elmination of all forms of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW) ordinance provides us with an example of both government and civil society actors working together to initiate international law in the United States, as well as an example of a participatory problem-solving approach being used in place of the traditional top-down methods. From such a study this thesis concludes that not only is CEDAW necessary for women in the United States to experience a greater realization of their rights, but also finds that implementing CEDAW at the local or sub-national level can offer communities the opportunity to extend rights to their citizens that the national government has thus far failed to ensure. The greatest challenge will be making this alternative available in regions of the United States that may not be prepared to grant true gender equality.",San Francisco,-122.4194155,37.7749295,7

History",History,Patricia Cline Cohen,"This dissertation addresses the critically under-studied topic of fatherhood in U.S. History. Using an array of evidence from newspapers, demographic data (including California's controversial 1852 state census), and a variety of eyewitness accounts, it describes the experiences of San Francisco's nineteenth and early twentieth-century fathers and demonstrates how the ambitions and actions of fathers as fathers helped stimulate historical change. Along the way it re-evaluates historians' understanding of gender demographics in early San Francisco, including the misperception that a large number of women were prostitutes. The dissertation employs portrayals of two archetypal San Francisco fathers as paradigms to illuminate the lives of most fathers in San Francisco during the period. James King of William was a crusading newspaper editor whose aggressive editorial voice demanded reform so that Gold Rush era San Francisco could become a place where families could prosper in safety. His influence stimulated the revolution fomented by the 1856 San Francisco Committee of Vigilance, a revolution that influenced the city's political and social order into the twentieth century. Hubert Howe Bancroft was a businessman and noted historian. His activities as a businessman helped shape the economy of California, while his activities as a historian literally made the history of the region. The study shows that Bancroft linked all his activities to his ambitions for the welfare of his family. King and Bancroft were burgher patriarchs, men who built their lives around their roles as protectors of and providers for their families. Much more than mere breadwinners, such men occupied an active and influential position at the heart of their families. The changes burgher patriarchs wrought in nineteenth-century San Francisco on behalf of their families led to social and economic shifts at the beginning of the twentieth century that turned fathers away from burgher patriarchy. These changes included a growing consumer culture, the bureaucratization of enterprise, and the expropriation of many parental duties by state and social organizations. Increasingly, fathers gained status strictly from their success as breadwinners. Their focus became work and career. Their influence within the family faded, and the dominance of burgher patriarchy ended.",San Francisco,-122.4194155,37.7749295,7

Marine Science",Marine Science,Armand M. Kuris,"It is paradoxical that San Francisco Bay (SFB), the largest estuary on the West Coast of the Americas and an iconic ecosystem for biological invasions, is understudied regarding quantitative data on free-living species, and virtually unexamined regarding their parasites. I incorporate archaeological records, historical, and recent data to reconstruct the Bay's intertidal macroinvertebrate and shallow water fish assemblage circa 1850 AD to reveal a general shift in fauna from marine native to euryhaline exotic intertidal invertebrates. My findings suggest that the combination of biotic and abiotic forcing events impacted native species, especially mollusks and, with a time lag, resulted in the extirpation of many native species. My assessment of the distribution and abundance of the native and exotic intertidal and shallow water fauna of SFB finds that the ratio of exotic to native species varies among habitat assemblages, Bay regions, and taxa. The majority of motile species are native, whereas the majority of sedentary/sessile species are exotic, and the densities of some native taxa are so low that they are at risk of extirpation. Finally, I examine the Enemy Release Hypothesis in relation to metazoan parasitism and biological invasions. Community studies compare species richness, prevalence, and intensity of parasitism in similar natives and exotics within SFB. Biogeographical studies compare these metrics in SFB with populations of 5 exotic species in their native ranges, and with populations of 3 native species in other California estuaries. Exotic species in SFB experience enemy escape, but not always enemy release relative to similar native species. SFB populations of native species also experience partial release from digenetic trematodes relative to conspecifics in other estuaries. Multiple invasions in SFB may have altered host-parasite relationships through reduced encounter among co-evolved, and increased encounter among novel, hosts and parasites. Collectively, in SFB it appears that most native trematodes using fish as second intermediate hosts will be able to complete their life cycles using exotic species, but that trematodes using invertebrates a second intermediate hosts, except for those that use the snail C. californica, may be unable to complete their life cycles, representing an invisible form of biodiversity loss.",San Francisco,-122.4194155,37.7749295,7

Religious Studies",Religious Studies,Catherine L. Albanese,"This dissertation addresses the question: how can we make sense of secularization in the United States? The approach I adopt here is to consider secularization as the loss of religious leaders' authority to interpret controversial issues and to have a direct impact on local, state, and federal laws, regulations, policies, and procedures. I focus on religious leaders' responses to prostitution in San Francisco, California, during the years 1848-1917. Investigation involved reviewing primary source materials from archival repositories across the country. Some generalizations can be made about San Francisco religious leaders' responses to prostitution in terms of their respective religious traditions or communities. Protestant leaders sought to address causes of prostitution and to reform prostitutes. Catholic leaders attempted to remove prostitutes from public view. Jewish leaders addressed prostitution both in terms of public health and also in answer to fears about illegal international slavery operations. Responses in Chinatown included both innovations on popular religious practices from China that afforded prostitutes a recognized place in temple life, as well as Protestant missions that sought to reform prostitutes in ways that were partially adopted by Chinatown residents themselves. These responses varied in the degree to which they directly sought to change public policy. When direct engagement was attempted, religious leaders were frequently surprised at their inability to have an impact on city and state policies. This development can be seen as an illustration of secularization in San Francisco. Furthermore, I suggest that San Francisco religious leaders' lack of authority regarding prostitution can be explained in terms of local developments in labor and gender roles that occurred in the wake of the California Gold Rush. Similar developments were not evidenced in other parts of the United States until decades later, towards the close of the nineteenth century. This suggests that, at least with regard to issues related to prostitution, San Francisco secularized earlier than other parts of the country. Whether it makes sense to make broader claims about San Francisco's early secularization would require additional investigation into local religious leaders' responses to other controversial issues of the day.",San Francisco,-122.4194155,37.7749295,7

Sociology",Sociology,"Geoffrey Raymond, Nikki Jones","Recent uprisings in Baltimore, Maryland and Ferguson, Missouri have revealed a crisis of legitimacy for police in poor communities of color. This project considers the crisis of legitimacy for police at the street level.

Videos capture police-citizen interactions and analysis focused on bystander participation during the street encounter. Videos were analyzed using methods of analytic induction and visual coding schemes. Findings show that bystanders use taunting and insulting the police as a form of resistance. Additionally, bystanders give advice to the subject of the encounter. Furthermore, bystander comments reveal the ways they believe gender and race to be relevant to the police-citizen encounter and relationship with law enforcement more generally. Bystander talk reframes the encounter and positions the subject as victim and law enforcement as the source of trouble. Bystanders accuse the police of going beyond the parameters of their jobs to express sexual desire and racial antipathy. Additionally, bystander participation dramatizes the limits of police authority as bystanders offer the subject legal advice and creates derogatory experiences for the police.",San Francisco,-122.4194155,37.7749295,7

Sociology",Sociology,Geoffrey Raymond,"There is not much room within mainstream Hip Hop for women to claim space as cultural agents. The relative dearth of female emcees present to balance the gender perspectives within mainstream Hip Hop and no queer (or even openly queer friendly) voices in mainstream Hip Hop, leads to important questions for scholars to consider: In a musical culture that is seen as male dominated and somewhat hostile to the LGTBIQ community, how do queer women carve out a space that is solely their own? How do they do this in a realm in which they have double marginality? This research shifts the popular focus away from the pitfalls of mainstream Hip Hop and instead draws our attention to the way that Hip Hop is lived and practiced at the local and interactional level. This paper draws from ethnographic fieldwork, lyrical analysis and in depth interviews with lesbian Hip Hop artists from the San Francisco Bay Area in order to analyze the ways that queer women contribute to the broader landscape of the Bay Area underground Hip Hop scene. Specifically, this project explores how Queer women of color within the Hip Hop generation navigate a Bay Area music scene and a broader global underground of queer Hip Hop artists. In contrast to literature that highlights women's invisibility in Hip Hop, this paper describes how queer women work to make themselves visible within Hip Hop culture.",San Francisco,-122.4194155,37.7749295,7

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Jordan F. Clark,"California guidelines for recycled water reuse currently give preference to groundwater tracers to determine underground retention time, with a target retention time of >6 months from infiltration to drinking water extraction. Two prospective tracers were evaluated here: boron-10 (10B, the lesser abundant boron stable isotope), and heat (with recharging water warmed at sewage treatment plants and by solar radiation in surface-spreading basins). Bromide (Br-), a conservative deliberate salt tracer with limitations to low-volume settings, was released as a control. Tracer injection occurred when 3 kg of 10B-enriched boric acid and 36 kg of NaBr were added to the research test basin at San Gabriel Spreading Grounds, part of the Montebello Forebay, Los Angeles County, CA, USA. Recycled wastewater was piped directly to this basin at a rate of 2200 m3/day for ~two continuous months. 10B and Br- tracer breakthroughs were observed at seven monitoring wells ranging from directly beneath the basin floor to 150 m downgradient. Travel times ranged from 0.7 to 40 days. Arrival of Br- to each well was always coincident or preceded 10B arrival, reflecting retardation of 10B presumably due to exchange with clay surfaces. 10B/Br - travel time ratios determined from the center of mass ranged from 1 to 1.4. Travel times were successfully determined to all wells. Peak matching of diurnal variations was only possible at the nearest well (<1 day travel time). Basic analysis of temperature measurements, even in the absence of peak matching, yielded a reliable estimate of the underground residence time. Heat has great potential as an intrinsic tracer for managed recharge applications. Based on average tracer travel times, a vertical flow line directly below the test basin had an average vertical velocity of 3.3 m/day, equivalent to a recharge rate of 0.8 m/day.",San Gabriel,-118.1058333,34.0961111,2

Environmental Science and Management",Environmental Science and Management,Thomas Dunne,"This study investigates the physical controls to hydrologic exchange and heat exchange in a large lowland river at different scales. Through a combination of field experiments and modeling, this work addressed two ecologically-relevant scales in the San Joaquin River, CA: the riffle-pool scale (150 m) and the longitudinal scale (240 km). At the riffle-pool scale, in situ measurements of hydraulic conductivity (ksat) were collected over the length of two riffles, interstitial pore water temperatures were measured within artificial redds, and near-bed temperatures were obtained using 2 km of fiber optic cable and distributed temperature sensing (DTS). These data were used to inform a two-dimensional numerical model of subsurface flow and temperature in gravel bars. Asymmetry of bar morphology is a first-order control to the extent and magnitude of infiltration, which is greater at low flow than high flow. Hydraulic conductivity varies by orders of magnitude and systematic downstream coarsening arises related to the process of bar genesis. The lowest values of ksat were observed where the difference between the topographic gradient and the water surface gradient is at a maximum and thus where the infiltration would be greatest into a uniform bar. Morphology and fine sediment accumulation in recharge zones exert an important control over the mechanisms driving subsurface heat exchange. Conduction dominates heat exchange when infiltration fluxes are _ 0.4 -- 0.9 m/d-1 and depends on sediment grain size. A ksat value of approximately 135 -- 300 m/d-1 is required for advection-dominated exchange. At the longitudinal river scale, a spectral energy balance model was developed, assessed, and used without calibration to investigate the fluvial and hydroclimatological controls to the energy balance over the length of a river during a large-scale flow experiment. Absorbed shortwave radiation is the dominant heat flux and is controlled by changes in sediment, depth, and streamwise patterns in velocity which drive the advective exchange. Downstream variation in sediment results in a 20 percent change to total absorbed radiation and the relationship between net absorption and streambed sediment albedo is shown to be linear. During periods of low flow, up to 45 percent of absorption occurs at the bed.",San Joaquin,-121.1710389,37.9175935,1

Spanish and Portuguese",Spanish and Portuguese,Sara Poot-Herrera,"The fundamental importance of the examination of these African nuns' lives lies not only in the revelation of the discourse strategies their writers used to avoid, emphasize or modify the color of the nuns' skin, but also in the analysis of the unusual phenomenon represented by the characters who surrounded the nuns, permitting Sister Juana Esperanza and Sister Teresa Juliana entry to cloistered institutions and, thereby, aiding them to become the subject of documentation in spite of their race. The basic bibliography for this investigation are the texts of Jose Gomez de la Parra and Juan Carlos Pan y Agua, written during the 18 th century and relating to significant events in the religious orders to which they belonged. The chronicle of the Carmelite convent Fundacion, y primero siglo del muy religioso convento del senor San Jose de religiosas carmelitas descalzas, in which is found the ""life"" of Sister Juana Esperanza de San Alberto, was written by Jose Gomez de la Parra in 1732 in honor of the centennial of the establishment of the Carmelite order in Puebla. Juan Carlos Pan y Agua wrote the Compendio de la vida ejemplar de Sor Teresa Juliana de Santo Domingo in 1752, basing the exemplary life on the funeral sermon he had delivered for the Dominican nun. Contemplating a model of female religiosity in the realms of Spain and New Spain in the late 17th to early 18th centuries could return us to an archetypical Marianite representation, whose image of purity and perfection is traditionally white, possibly brown, but rarely black. What happens when this construction of sanctity is based on something extraordinary and inserted in its deep-rooted orthodoxy? What happens when the destiny of two marginalized women, in this case two African slaves who took religious orders on either side of the Atlantic, becomes the object of exemplary religious discourse? This investigation presents the exemplary lives (vidas ejemplares) of Sister Juana Esperanza de San Alberto and Sister Teresa Juliana de Santo Domingo that, in spite of their appearance and condition, ceased to be slaves and became instead models of virtue. In addition to containing the vidas ejemplares of these African nuns, the richness of the texts themselves as well as the circumstances in which they were produced, give these writings an importance of their own. Compilations of the vidas ejemplares and the confessional autobiographies of the Carmelite nuns of Puebla are found in the chronicle of Gomez de la Parra. Pan y Aguas' compendium, based on the funeral speech of Teresa Juliana and written by the same author, contains discourse conventions which raise it above its genre and approach that of hagiography.",San Jose,-121.8863286,37.3382082,2

History of Art and Architecture",History of Art and Architecture,Edson Armi,"A sense of spatial expansiveness develops, born from an increasing ease with being a water-based state, from the eleventh century on, evidenced in a redefinition of the Piazza San Marco in terms of its connection, both physically and ceremonially with the lagoon. Shifting from the ninth and tenth century concerns with the definition of perimeters and the need for defense of the lagoon, what emerges, in tandem with growing Venetian trade, is an emphasis on the Piazza representing the city-state as an imperium. Already a more amorphous entity to define because of the city being surrounded by the lagoon, it is only step away to begin to identify with more distant bodies of water. At first at ease within the Po and Brenta river networks, the Venetians expand to establish control of the upper Adriatic followed by their dominance in the entire area of the sea. From its inception as a small apron-space in the ninth century to the thirteenth century's enlarged and ornamented civic square, how has the Piazza San Marco been used and how has it served a variety of people's interests? If examined over time, can its transforming contours and usage contribute to an historical study of how Venetians saw themselves and imagined their city relating to the larger world? What is uncovered, in the historical view of it as a civic space, is that priorities and values did change according to Venice's perceived relationship to the region and to the Mediterranean world. If the ninth century inception, eleventh century reconstruction, twelfth century expansion, and thirteenth century enrichment of the Piazza are studied, in the light of its physical amendments and its usage, it is apparent that Venetian ideas about limits, borders and boundaries are transforming. It is only a matter of time and of opportunity, before dominion is extended to a strategic chain of entrepots in the Mediterranean and mare nostrum, itself, seems an extension of the Venetian lagoon. Methods used in this study included site visits for measurement and observation and the study of archival records and chronicles. Great use was made of reports on the limited archaeological work that has been done on Rive Alto as well as the lively debate and scholarship reflected in the voluminous secondary work. The un-built zones or ""openings"" in the urban fabric of cities change over time, revealing changes in priorities, circumstances and social values. Civic spaces particularly reflect transforming attitudes and commitments. The Piazza San Marco, in Venice, Italy, is a fitting example of an urban zone that has been, up to the present, a pivotal meeting place.

Anthropology",Anthropology,Juan Vicente Palerm,"Despite predictions they would disappear, peasants have been resilient. I argue that this resilience warrants renewed anthropological attention. In 2009, I conducted participant-observation research in a peasant community, San Pablo Coatlan, Oaxaca, Mexico. During my fieldwork the community was torn between a powerful minority who sought to bring ""modernization"" by reorganizing the political structure and privatizing the land and the majority who supported the traditional political structure and communal land. This political conflict provided an excellent opportunity to understand the resilience of the peasantry. I define peasants as those who have the ability to practice subsistence farming, but do not have the ability to accumulate wealth. I argue that the resilience of the peasantry is largely a result of two factors: liminal livelihoods, and social capital. First, peasant livelihoods are liminal: they are at the edge of subsistence production, market production, and wage labor. Peasants are not an intermediate stage between ""primitive"" and ""modern"", their livelihoods are active strategies to combine available opportunities. Peasants' ability to practice subsistence farming provides a productive use for household labor. This ability is important even for those who are dedicated entirely to wage labor because the ability to return to subsistence farming is a form of insurance. The second factor which contributes to the resilience of the peasantry is social capital. Peasants can rely on the support of their fellow community members. In San Pablo, people use unpaid cooperative labor for farming and home construction. I show that much of the farming would not be possible if farmers had to hire workers when they needed additional hands. I explore the various motives to collaborate in private production and in public life. I argue that there are several instrumental motives to participate: direct rewards, reciprocity, and prestige. There are also several consummatory motives: enjoyment, value introjection, and bounded solidarity. I organize these motives into a framework to understand participation that connects the motives to material, structural, and ideological factors within the community. In the conclusion, I argue that this framework has applicability beyond peasant communities to better understand the motives to contribute to the common good.",San Pablo Coatlan,-96.7842996,16.2231447,1

It provides a sociological, historical, and materialist analysis of the militarization of the Los Angeles Police Department, the policing of youth and surplus labor populations in El Salvador, the so-called ""war on drugs"" in Mexico, and the emergence of hip hop as a cultural form of expression in the heavily policed Pico Union district of Los Angeles to conceptualize what I call ""transnational apparatuses of social control"". It demonstrates that during the epoch of global capitalism, repressive nation-state apparatuses have taken transnational dimensions. It shows that these forms of social control should be understood alongside neoliberal policies such as structural adjustments programs (SAPs) and free trade policies, and the proposed ""wars"" on drugs, crime, gangs, terrorism, and anti-migrant policies in this region. It illustrates that the transnationalization of social control emerged as a response to social and economic crises that have developed from neoliberalism, racial and social inequality, and the emergence of grassroots social movements. While remaining attentive to the repressive apparatuses of social control in a transnational context, Policing the Wretched also examines how social movements in Los Angeles, Mexico City, and San Salvador have contested neoliberal policies, security initiatives, and militarization. Through interviews, participant observations, and archival research (government documents, congressional reports, and studies; presidential addresses; media sources and journalist accounts; and non-governmental literature, studies, and research) spanning three countries, the project traces the ways in which social movements in the U.S., Mexico, and El Salvador have mobilized and waged a relentless struggle over hegemony that provides an alternative social warrant that places democracy over securitization and human rights over property rights. It concludes by showing how hip hop in Los Angeles delineates acritique of transnational social control and a culture of resistance.

It highlights important factors that shape the organizational structure of schools and classrooms, and in turn, how they engender disparities in the ways students experience education, namely, in the opportunities made available to them to achieve and succeed at a high level. This dissertation operates at the confluence of notions about class, gender, language, and race, especially as they revolve around public education and the hegemonic meritocratic discourse on which it is founded. This dissertation engages and contributes to scholarship within the following areas: The political economy of education; discourse and the dialectical relationship between agency and structure; cultural perspectives on identity, voice, and learning; and, Latinas/os in science education. The data that serve as the basis for the findings presented in this dissertation were collected throughout a three-phase yearlong ethnographic study of the two tracked fifth-grade classrooms at Amblen Elementary School, serving a socioeconomically disadvantaged Latina/o student population in Santa Barbara, California. In classrooms all across the nation, while it remains true that Latina/o students disproportionally take up space in the lower-tracked courses and not in the higher ones, this study does not examine inequality in tracking assignments made along ethnic/racial lines (as 100% of the students that participated in this research identify as Latina/o), rather, it investigates the consequences of what happens when Latina/o students are tracked according to symbolic markers of their ethnic/racial identity, that is, their varying levels of English language competency. Using data from participant observation, semi-structured interviews, students' drawings, as well as free-list and rank-order exercises, I was able to answer the following central research questions: In what ways do the division of students into groups (based on academic ability [i.e., English language proficiency] and behavior) impact: (a) the number and types of opportunities for Latinas/os to succeed in school science? (b) how Latinas/os negotiate the concept of 'success' in school science? And (c) the ways in which Latinas/os claim and perform successful school science identities? During my time with the fifth-grade youth of Amblen Elementary School, I found that not all students were necessarily expected to succeed in the same ways and with the same frequency. I also found that while there existed considerable overlaps, what it meant to be a ""good"" science student in one classroom was qualitatively different from what it meant in the other. Importantly, these differences in classroom expectations helped to mold (or inhibit) students' individual understandings of self as capable and/or ""smart"" students.

Anthropology",Anthropology,Michael A. Glassow,"The Chumash living in the Santa Barbara Channel region at the time of European contact in AD 1542, and into the Early Historic period (AD 1782-1834), are described in historic documents as living a sedentary lifestyle settled in large, permanent villages. Although archaeologists working in the region today have a number of historical sources and ethnographic records to contextualize their work, little archaeological research using modern excavation and laboratory techniques has been undertaken, and much remains unknown about how the Chumash organized their households and communities and constructed economic, political, and social relationships. Results indicate that the houses were occupied by fewer individuals than was typical, although residents of the village did invest substantial labor at the sites, constructing houses and possibly a small sweat lodge. This suggests that while occupation may not have been permanent, it was significant. Residents were involved in a number of activities including the production of shell beads and ornaments, the production and maintenance of stone tools, and the collection and processing of plant and animal foods. Additionally, an analysis of the activities in which the community was engaged reveals how residents created and maintained their identity through daily practice against the backdrop of significant social, political, and economic transformation in colonial-era California. Recently, a few late prehistoric and historic sites on the Northern Channel Islands have been identified and recorded away from permanent village sites. Three of these small sites (SCRI-324, -384, -801) located in the interior of Santa Cruz Island are believed to represent the Early Historic period village of Nimatlala. These sites appear to be very different from other Early Historic period villages in that they contain smaller house depressions and shallow midden deposits. Excavation of houses and deposits at SCRI-324 and SCRI-384 was undertaken in an effort to discern the chronology of occupation, the organization of households and the community as a whole, and the nature of activities undertaken at the site.",Santa Barbara,-119.6981901,34.4208305,33

Anthropology",Anthropology,Susan C. Stonich,"This dissertation examines food insecurity in the context of displacement and transnational migration of women from Mexico and Central America to the US. Drawing upon 18 months of ethnographic fieldwork conducted between 2008 and 2011 in the coastal region of Santa Barbara, California, I advance and contribute to several arguments. In presenting the lived experience of ""food insecurity"", I analyze the everyday forms of structural violence that shape the experience of migrant women, particularly in terms of food, health, and bodies, and I critique interventions to food insecurity and ""diet-related health problems"" implemented by state and nonprofit agencies. I argue that through their everyday struggles and interactions with groups providing assistance, migrant women navigate power differentials rooted in distinctions of race, class, gender, and legal status while also negotiating and performing new modes of citizenship. Using data from participant observation, surveys, semi-structured interviews, life history interviews, and focus groups, I seek to answer the following research questions: What is the lived experience of food insecurity among Mexican and Central American migrant women in the US, and what are the structural forces contributing to this experience? At the local level, how do nonprofit entities and public health practitioners engage in the discourse and practice of food security, particularly as it affects migrant women? And, what do the lived experience of food insecurity and interventions by state and non-state actors reveal about changing notions of rights and citizenship and about the production of class and structural violence? The answers to these questions help inform my engagement with and contribution to four primary bodies of scholarship: political economy of food and migration; political ecology of food and health; ideas of power, the state, and hegemony; and critical approaches to race, class, gender, and citizenship. In engaging with the core themes of this dissertation---food, health, and citizenship---I analyze the dialectical relationship between structural conditions and individual agency. I use the rhetoric of ""the other side"" ( el otro lado), a phrase invoked by migrant women to reference life outside of the US (specifically on the other side of the US-Mexico border), to underscore the variety of borders that limit access to livelihood resources for unauthorized migrants living in the US.",Santa Barbara,-119.6981901,34.4208305,33

Communication",Communication,Robin Nabi,"A considerable body of research has identified five audience variables---identification, parasocial interaction, personal relevance, transportation, and perceived realism---that facilitate media effects on personal risk perceptions. The literature in this area, however, remains stagnant and fragmented, as research concerning these variables has yet to be effectively integrated to offer a parsimonious account of the underlying process. The present research represents an effort to integrate this disjointed literature by proposing the risk convergence model, a theoretical framework that postulates the reduction of perceived social distance between the self and others depicted in the media as a unifying mechanism whereby media can influence personal risk perceptions. In an initial test of this model, 500 undergraduate students at the University of California, Santa Barbara, participated in an experiment employing 2 (high vs. low transportation) x 2 (diagnosis vs. scare storyline) between-subjects factorial design. Participants were exposed to entertainment clips that either portrayed a main character who is diagnosed with a sexually transmitted disease (STD; diagnosed storyline) or thinks he/she might have caught an STD and gets scared of testing for it (scare storyline). Overall, the risk convergence model received solid support from the data, with all paths emerging as significant except for the link between perceived realism and social distance. Specifically, reduction of social distance completely mediated the relationship between identification, transportation and personal risk perceptions, thus suggesting social distance as a valid causal mechanism of the process involving the two variables. Personal relevance was found to both directly and indirectly (via reduction of social distance) influence personal risk, while perceived realism did not show any significant associations with social distance and personal risk perceptions. The findings suggest that reduction of social distance may be the underlying mechanism that can explain media's influence on personal risk perceptions and that the four audience involvement variables possess distance-reducing qualities that allow them to influence personal risk perceptions.",Santa Barbara,-119.6981901,34.4208305,33

In order to address the present gaps in the field, this project used data from both children and parents to investigate and clarify the relationship between perceived disaster-related stress, family-level protective factors and children's negative and positive adjustment following three devastating wildfires that occurred in Santa Barbara County in 2008-2009. Participants included 50 families who were living in homes that were damaged or destroyed by the fires or were forced to evacuate. Results indicated that child gender and children's perceived social support were significant predictors of children's emotional symptoms as reported by children, but not as reported by parents. In addition, findings suggested that children's perceived social support served as a moderator of the relationship between perceived fire-related stress and children's prosocial behaviors, as reported by parents. Clinical and research implications of these findings are discussed.",Santa Barbara,-119.6981901,34.4208305,33

Earth Science",Earth Science,David L. Valentine,"Samples containing low and medium natural gas concentrations were collected from the world's largest natural marine seep field, Coal Oil Point, located offshore of Santa Barbara, California. Natural gas emanating from Coal Oil Point first diffuses into sediment porewater before migrating into the overlying water column to form a dissolved plume. Novel radioactive tracers were developed and applied to assess the timing by which microbes metabolize these gases within both the water column and sediment. A three phase study was employed to track the dissolved hydrocarbon plume within the water column. Phase 1 synthesized tritiated ethane, propane, and butane using Grignard reagents and tritiated water; Phase 2 systematically assessed the experimental conditions, wherein the indigenous microbial community was found to rapidly oxidize ethane, propane, and butane; Phase 3 applied radioactive tracers to track microbial oxidation within a dissolved hydrocarbon plume. Spatial and temporal patterns of ethane, propane, and butane oxidation down current from the hydrocarbon seeps demonstrated that >99% of these gases were metabolized within 1.3 days following initial exposure. Estimates based on the observed metabolic rates and carbon mass balance calculations suggest that ethane-, propane-, and butane-consuming microorganisms may transiently account for a majority of the total microbial community within impacted waters. Samples containing high natural gas concentrations were collected from the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, both during and following the nearly three-month hydrocarbon release. Microbial oxidation of ethane and propane was tracked using stable isotope (13C) tracers. Within 20 weeks of the onset of hydrocarbon release, the microbial communities had ""bloomed"" to consume elevated concentrations of ethane and propane, and subsequently ""busted"" following a prolonged period of starvation. This short time interval for complete natural gas consumption contradicts initial predictions based on previous methane studies, and indicates that oxidation rates can accelerate in environments of high hydrocarbon concentrations. Sediment studies focused on the metabolism of ethane oxidation from two individual seeps within the Coal Oil Point field: Campus Point Mounds and Patch Seep. Ethane oxidation was quantified in slurry incubations under anaerobic conditions, which indicated that >97% of the gas was removed after 43 days when incubated near in situ temperature and gas concentrations. This study was the first to quantify anaerobic ethane oxidation within cold seep sediments. Total ethane consumption rates from Campus Point Mounds and Patch Seep were calculated to be 2 microM day-1 and 0.012 microM day-1, respectively, revealing that anaerobic oxidation in sediment is a dynamic process capable of modulating ethane's release into the ocean and atmosphere. Ethane oxidation was also quantified in whole core profiles. These profiles showed elevated ethane oxidation rates to depths of 11 cm beneath the sea floor, but rates below detection in the underlying zone of low sulfate. Natural gases have many environmental consequences if released into the atmosphere due to their high global warming potentials. However, these gases are subject to oxidation by microorganisms, which act as an effective biofilter that limits the atmospheric input. Organisms responsible for this oxidation are present in a wide range of environments and hydrocarbon compositions. To quantify the rate at which a microbial community oxidizes and regulates the flux of hydrocarbons into an environment, a combination of chemical tracer techniques is typically applied. This work applied both stable and radioactive tracers to monitor the oxidation capacity of the microbial community in both water column and marine sediment, with hydrocarbon concentrations generally ranging from low (coastal systems near hydrocarbon reservoirs) to medium (natural seeps) to high (oil spills).",Santa Barbara,-119.6981901,34.4208305,33

Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology","Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology","Steven D. Gaines, Gretchen E. Hofmann","The accurate description of marine dispersal is an ongoing challenge. Recent efforts have led to an improved understanding of larval dispersal, but there remains a paucity of studies that describe average dispersal patterns for marine species or examine the effects of dispersal on large-scale biogeographical patterns. This work first reviews literature on what role of physical features play haping species distributions through dispersal limitation in terrestrial and marine species. The review suggests that while there is some evidence that marine species distributions can be shaped by physical barriers to dispersal, there is far less work devoted to the issue than in terrestrial systems. In the third chapter, we present a new tool to measure larval abundance. We adapted existing protocols that label larvae using fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH), and combined them with recent cell sorting technology (CS) so that larvae could be quickly and accurately sorted from plankton samples. Between chapters III and IV, we present DNA probes for three bivalve taxa: Musculista senhousia, Mytilus edulis/galloprovincialis/trossulus, and Mytilus californianus/Septifer spp, and one barnacle grouping of Tetraclita rubescens/ Chthamalus spp. In the fourth chapter, we employ FISH-CS to monitor the abundance of barnacle and mussel larvae in the Santa Barbara Harbor (SBH), California. Using these abundance data, we determined that the barnacle T. rubescens likely arrives at SBH from more distant sites while the mussels M. californianus and Septifer remain near SBH throughout development. In addition, we found that early- and late-stage barnacles were concentrated onshore by internal tides but mussels were not. Finally, we tested the theory that ocean currents can sufficiently limit larval dispersal to establish species' range limits, and examined the effects of a leaky barrier. We found the settlement of Septifer was significantly lower on the northern side of a potential current-driven dispersal filter at Point Conception, California. This decreased settlement corresponds with the species' northern range boundary. Current reversals were found to be correlated with increased settlement beyond the species' range edge, but the settlement was significantly lower than that observed within the adult distribution.",Santa Barbara,-119.6981901,34.4208305,33

Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology","Ecology, Evolution and Marine Biology",Armand Kuris,"Harbors and coastal embayments serve as focal points of invasion by sessile epibenthic invertebrates. Despite considerable information on the geographic distribution of such taxa, information on the patterns of their small-scale spatial variability and the importance of local environmental factors that influence these patterns is needed to better manage the spread of invasive species. Here I (1) quantify spatial patterns in recruitment of sessile epibenthic invertebrates of non-native, native and cryptogenic origins within Santa Barbara Harbor (SBH), (2) assess the extent to which spatial patterns in recruitment could be explained by variations in local environmental factors, and (3) evaluate the extent to which spatial patterns in recruitment could account for observed patterns of spatial variation in natural assemblages within the harbor. The majority of invertebrate taxa found on SBH's floating docks (75%) and on recruitment plates (91%) were of non-native or cryptogenic origins. The non-native tunicates Ciona spp. (C. savygni and C. intestinalis) and Diplosoma listerianum, the bryozoan Watersipora subtorquata, the native bryozoan Celleporaria brunnea, and the taxonomically unresolved spirorbid polychaetes showed strong spatial patterns in recruitment within the harbor. Recruitment of Ciona spp. was negatively associated with water flow, whereas that of D. listerianum and W. subtorquata was positively associated with the presence of conspecifics on the floating docks. Spatial patterns in recruitment of two taxa ( Celleporaria brunnea and spirorbid polychaetes) were not associated with any measured environmental factor. However, spatial patterns in recruitment were positively associated with proportional cover of the epibenthic assemblage after 12 months of development for Ciona spp., C. brunnea and spirorbid polychaetes. My results indicate that variation in water flow and the presence of conspecifics significantly influenced spatial patterns in recruitment within SBH for three of the five invertebrate taxa. Observational and experimental evidence suggests that water flow plays a significant role in the initial establishment of Ciona spp. However, other factors, such as competition for space, or mortality may also influence longer-term development of the epibenthic assemblage. Understanding the relationship between environmental factors and patterns in recruitment may improve our ability to predict the distribution of epibenthic invertebrate invasions. These results may be used to develop a predictive framework that considers location within a harbor, as well as harbor design, to optimize boat-hull cleaning strategies (e.g., frequency and timing) and target problem species.",Santa Barbara,-119.6981901,34.4208305,33

Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology","Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology","Sally Holbrook, Daniel C. Reed","I found that the natural course of progressive senescence in fronds can explain much of the variability in frond loss throughout a typical year in a Santa Barbara kelp bed, that kelp blades that have more access to light have shorter lifetimes (as predicted by leaf lifespan theory), and that ignoring the sub-lethal blade area losses can result in significant underestimates of net primary productivity. I believe that internal regulation of tissue turnover is an important mechanism by which giant kelp maximizes carbon gain in a changing environment and that adaptations that increase photosynthetic efficiency may be an important factor in the widespread success and dominance of Macrocystis.. Energy fixed by primary producers supports the vast majority of life on earth. The giant kelp Macrocystis pyrifera is the largest marine alga in the world and supports one of the most productive ecosystems on earth. Carbon fixed by Macrocystis pyrifera on temparate rocky reefs not only provides essential habitat for an entire community of associated species, but also provides carbon subsidies to nearby ecological communities. Net primary productivity (NPP) is often used to quantify energy fixation by autotrophs, and researchers often measure NPP by summing the incremental increases in biomass and foliar losses. While the processes governing incremental increases in biomass have been well studied, the processes that drive the loss of foliar biomass are poorly understood. I investigated drivers that regulate frond and blade lifespan in Macrocystis, and the consequences of limited frond and blade lifespans. The first chapter is a long-term, multi-site analysis of frond lifetimes and exploration of internal and external drivers that could affect frond lifetime. This study provides broad spatial and temporal scope and identifies progressive senescence as an important driver of Macrocystis biomass dynamics. The second chapter employs a more focused field study to investigate whether spatial variability in light within a kelp forests affects lifespan, size, thickness, nitrogen content and pigment content of Macrocystis pyrifera blades in ways that are predicted by theory developed to predict leaf traits of vascular plants. The last chapter is a mathematical model of the system, which I parameterized with field data, to explicitly quantify the loss of blade tissue via erosion and quantify the amount of biomass not captured in traditional surveys of net primary productivity. The main theme of my research is the investigation of the drivers that regulate the lifespan of foliar biomass of giant kelp beds near Santa Barbara, California, USA. Tissue lifespan in marine macroalgae has not received much attention from either plant ecologists or algal ecologists, despite its potential importance to the dynamics of primary productivity. Macrocystis is an ideal species for investigations on tissue lifespan in macroalgae for two main reasons. First, it is well studied and much of its biology is already known, and second, Macrocystis is locally abundant, grows fast and turns over frequently. In addition, due to relatively benign environmental conditions for Macrocystis growth, the coastal margin along the Santa Barbara Channel is an ideal location to study intrinsic properties in the absence of extreme environmental forcing (such as frequent temperature spikes and severe storm events) that could overwhelm potentially important patterns.",Santa Barbara,-119.6981901,34.4208305,33

Economics",Economics,Christopher Costello,"Problems arising from the common-pool nature of fisheries are well known (Gordon 1954). Recent research estimates the lost economic benefits from suboptimal fisheries production to be on the order of $50 billion annually (Arnason et al. 2009). Among the most promising management tools for improving fisheries performance are closed areas (marine reserves) and rights-based management (catch shares) (Worm et al. 2009). This collection of essays examines the emergence and performance of these two policy tools from an economics perspective. The first chapter examines the determinants of the transition from command and control regulation to rights-based management in common-pool resources. I develop a conceptual framework describing a regulator's decision to adopt a rights-based management regime in a common-pool resource and empirically test the hypotheses advanced in the framework with a duration analysis of rights-based management program adoption in a group of federally managed Alaska fisheries. Consistent with the conceptual framework, I find that rent dissipation along input cost and product value dimensions increases likelihood of program adoption, and high transaction costs decrease likelihood of program adoption. I find mixed evidence that resource depletion increases probability of program adoption. The second chapter examines the capacity of marine reserves to function as a cooperation mechanism in transboundary fisheries, stocks shared by two or more jurisdictions. Using a game theoretic model, we find that marine reserve implementation can achieve first-best equilibrium economic outcomes. We illustrate our theoretical predictions with a case study of the Chilean loco fishery. The third chapter estimates the economic and biological outcomes of the implementation of a marine reserve network at the California Channel Islands in 2003 on the Santa Barbara Area red sea urchin fishery. The paper develops an integrated bioeconomic model of the fishery consisting of an age structured population model and a discrete choice model of fishermen behavior linked via the fishing mortality rate. We calibrate the model using a 15-year panel dataset of fishery data and use the calibrated model to simulate outcomes under a counterfactual no-reserve scenario. We find that eight years after reserve implementation, urchin biomass is 53.7% higher, fishery yield is 11.3% lower, and fishery revenue is 10.9% lower compared to simulated outcomes under a counterfactual no-reserve policy.",Santa Barbara,-119.6981901,34.4208305,33

The Writing Program had experienced significant changes including budgetary reductions since 2008 as well as turnover in leadership. These changes have impacted the culture of the organization. Interest in organizational culture is related to a larger concern in organizational theory with managing uncertainty. Martin (1992; 2002) suggests that all organizations exhibit levels of ambiguity or uncertainty. To describe and explain how the writing program used in this study deals with uncertainty and change in the environment over time, I used Martin's (1992; 2002) three perspective theory of organizational culture. This study primarily used qualitative interviewing, informed by the single case study design (Yin, 2009). The study was actualized in two phases; wherein Phase 1 served as a pilot study for Phase 2. The findings showed that challenges to the Writing Program included turnover in the director position and an uncertain budgetary climate in the university at large. From an integration perspective, the leaders of the Writing Program fostered a shared culture of collegiality and generosity. Subcultures in Phase 1 and Phase 2 were generally similar. Informants in both phases identified subcultures across disciplines and curricular focus as well as administration and instructional staff. Through the lens of the fragmentation perspective the Writing Program exhibited elements of fragmentation in both phases. During Phase 1 informants were concerned about the Writing Program's status as a function of its position as a less powerful program within the university. During Phase 2 newer organizational members revealed that they did not identify with certain subcultures and did not always know what issues and problems were at odds in the program. The personnel review process, lead by the personnel committee chair, provided a source of high personal uncertainty and organizational ambiguity.

Education",Education,Richard P. Duran,"The focus of this study is the analysis and evaluation of critical transitions and critical conditions among underrepresented minority (URM) junior high school students from immigrant families participating in a program of academic improvement in Santa Barbara, CA. The study examined the 2 x 2 pattern of achievement goal orientation (Elliot & McGregor, 2001); motivational dispositions, including academic efficacy, academic self-handicapping, disruptive behavior, self-presentation of low achievement, and skepticism about the relevance of school for future success; and academic performance among junior high school minority students from low-income immigrant families participating in a college preparation program called Pathways. The validation of achievement goal orientation of these students was measured using psychometric methods as a means of ensuring its validity and reliability. The students' goal orientation was identified by using a cluster analysis method and later linked to student academic motivation and achievement. The cluster analysis identified four clusters of students with different goal orientation profiles in the math classroom subject and five clusters in the English classroom subject. Despite the slight differences across the four profiles, certain aspects of the goal orientation patterns exhibited by the groups were shared across the two domains (i.e., math and English classroom subjects). Students who exhibited a pattern in which mastery-approach and performance-avoidance goals were dominant showed the most positive motivational and achievement profile. In contrast, students who belonged to flat or semiflat goal orientation profiles, where none of any type of goals was dominant, showed negative academic beliefs, strategies, and lower academic outcomes. While students whose flat profile were high in all goals performed slightly better than those in the profile that scored low in all goals, nevertheless, both of the flat goal orientation profiles exhibited lower academic motivation and achievement than students with at least one dominant goal. The finding also illustrated the relationship between goal orientation profiles and students' sociodemographic characteristics. The analysis of students' achievement goal orientation in connection to students' academic-related perceptions, beliefs, and strategies is crucial in understanding how students learn and process information, and how we can further improve an academic preparation program, such as Pathways, by tailoring it to the needs of students from historically underrepresented groups and enhance their access to higher education.",Santa Barbara,-119.6981901,34.4208305,33

This dissertation addresses the challenges of designing a wide-area camera network and finding the spatial and temporal relationships between the cameras. In particular, we examine the challenges of calibrating non-overlapping cameras, aligning unsynchronized cameras with variable frame rates, and synchronizing cameras with variable frame rates. This research is largely motivated by the Scalable, Large Optical Sensor Network (SCALLOPSNet), a wide-area network deployed across the University of California, Santa Barbara. This dissertation describes the features of this network and the data that is used to validate our solutions. The first challenge is the 3D calibration of cameras with non-overlapping views. We propose to calibrate each camera in a global geographic coordinate system that is introduced by a mobile device, such as a smartphone. We formulate this geo-calibration as a maximum-likelihood estimation of the position and orientation of each camera given multimodal sensor measurements from a mobile device. The mobile devices record multiple images that overlap with the camera to be calibrated with its GPS location and 3D orientation. We show that this estimation can be solved using a consensus algorithm. The second challenge is the alignment of overlapping cameras that have unsynchronized start times and variable frame rates. We use the intersections of object trajectories as a reliable feature point that can be matched across views. The potential matching intersections are derived from matching trajectories. Trajectories are matched by, first, representing the spatial and temporal relationships between trajectories in a view in a Spatio-Temporal Context Graph and, then, matching these graphs across views. The final challenge is the synchronization of overlapping cameras with variable frame rates. Existing methods address cameras with fixed frame rates and known homographies. We formulate the problem mathematically to include variable frame rates, clock drift, and clock skew. The proposed solution is based on matching intersections of object trajectories. Addressing these challenges advances the state of the art in deploying wide-area camera networks. In particular, it enables the deployment of wireless cameras with non-overlapping views or unsynchronized frames.",Santa Barbara,-119.6981901,34.4208305,33

Environmental Science and Management",Environmental Science and Management,John M. Melack,"As stream runoff increased, three agricultural watersheds showed nitrate dilution, two urban watersheds showed invariance, and one undeveloped watershed showed nitrate enrichment. The undeveloped upper mountainous watershed regions were dominant contributors of water and nitrate to stream runoff and nitrate across the whole watershed during periods of high runoff, such that the variability in stream nitrate concentrations during stormflow (rainstorms) was ~ 12% of the nitrate variability during baseflow (dry periods). In beach pore water, fresh groundwater with potentially elevated nitrate is largely precluded from discharge through beach sands by the dominant coastal bluff geomorphology of the region. However, tides circulate seawater into and out of beach sands, introducing marine particulate organic matter (POM), such as phytoplankton, giant kelp (Macrocystis pyrifera), and detrital material that is then degraded by heterotrophic microbes in beach sands to DOM and DIN. Nitrogen plays a dual role in coastal oceans. It sustains primary production, the foundation of coastal marine food webs, but can also cause degradation in the forms of eutrophication, harmful algal blooms, and hypoxia when supplied in excessive quantity from urban and agricultural land uses. In this dissertation, I examined the biogeochemical, land use, and hydrologic factors that regulate the concentration of dissolved inorganic nitrogen (DIN) in two nitrogen suppliers to the nearshore coastal ocean in the Santa Barbara, California region: watershed streams and beach pore water. In addition, I examined the influence of nearshore seawater and beach pore water dissolved organic matter (DOM) composition on the uptake of DIN by bacterioplankton, the primary decomposers in coastal oceans. I found that that the relationships between stream nitrate concentration and stream runoff were consistent within three broad land uses: agricultural, urban, and undeveloped. I used excitation emission matrix (EEM) fluorescence spectroscopy, respiratory quotient determinations (i.e., ratio of CO2 production to O 2 consumption), and DIN concentration analysis in a 7-day time-series dark incubation to determine how variability in DOM composition in seawater and pore water influenced DIN uptake by bacterioplankton in nearshore seawater. I found that mixing of seawater and pore water promoted greater DIN uptake than occurred in pore water alone, which is likely the result of the presence of more labile seawater DOM and/or production of more labile DOM under seawater and pore water mixing. Together, the studies described herein enhance our understanding of nitrogen dynamics in coastal marine regions, and thus can enhance coastal zone management and development practices that seek to preserve the functioning of coastal marine ecosystems. I integrated pore water radon residence time distributions with DIN temporal evolution curves to calculate volume-weighted mean (VWM) DIN concentrations, which represented the DIN concentration of pore water discharging to the coastal ocean. I found that the combination of temporal variability in the residence time distribution due to spring-neap tidal cycles with the temporal evolution of DIN concentrations due to POM and DOM loading can result in substantial variability in pore water VWM DIN concentrations that should be accounted for in calculating DIN flux to coastal oceans. When pore water mixes with nearshore seawater upon discharge from the beach sands, DIN that was produced within beaches becomes available for uptake by bacterioplankton.",Santa Barbara,-119.6981901,34.4208305,33

Environmental Science and Management",Environmental Science and Management,Christina Tague,"In water-stressed semi-arid areas, the impact of urbanization on ecohydrologic processes such as vegetation water use and net primary productivity is of concern. This dissertation seeks to increase understanding of ecohydrologic processes within an urban and semi-arid context through the application of an ecohydrological model (the Regional Ecohydrologic Simulation System, RHESSys) to the Mission Creek catchment in Santa Barbara County, CA. The analysis first quantifies the impact of uncertainties from both calibrated soil parameters and inputs (precipitation scaling, temperature, and outdoor water use) on model output. I find that the relative impact of different sources of uncertainty varies throughout the water year and with the model output of interest. Early in the water year (Oct-Nov), soils are relatively dry and soil parameters exert a strong control on streamflow. As the rainy season progresses and soils become more saturated, streamflow becomes more sensitive to uncertainty in the scaling of precipitation with elevation. In the spring and summer months, modeled ET becomes more sensitive to calibrated soil parameters and outdoor water use as plant water demands increase and soil water stores are utilized for ET. I next devised and tested a series of alternative calibration approaches aimed at reducing the potential for observation and input error to introduce bias in the calibration process. I find that valuing stability of model performance across the calibration period results in the selection of soil parameters with more consistent performance between calibration and evaluation periods. I also find that filtering periods of suspected error or model weakness from the calibration period will greatly alter the distribution of acceptable parameter sets. Surprisingly, calibrating across a range of precipitation scaling uncertainty does not change the relative performance of different parameter sets. Finally, I use the calibrated model to conduct an analysis of the role of effective impervious surface area (EIA) on vegetation water use and productivity. I demonstrate that connectivity between impervious areas and the drainage network can influence modeled vegetation water use and productivity: reducing the EIA fraction of total impervious area increases runoff infiltration and can mitigate or even cancel reduction in vegetation water use and NPP directly due to vegetation loss with increased impervious surface coverage. My results indicate that runoff from impervious surfaces into neighboring vegetated areas can increase transpiration and NPP in these vegetated areas well into the dry season. As an extended dry season is common to Mediterranean sites, this finding is of interest with regards to maximizing vegetation productivity in water stressed urban areas while minimizing the need for additional water inputs from irrigation. A first order approximation of the EIA fraction into a catchment scale model indicates that the effect of accounting for the EIA fraction on model ET and NPP estimates will vary between wet and dry years, with an increasing effect during wet years and a minimal effect during dry years.",Santa Barbara,-119.6981901,34.4208305,33

Environmental Science and Management",Environmental Science and Management,Hunter S.

The research goals addressed in this work include: (1) establishing a collaborative approach to gathering fisheries data for assessments and management; (2) assessment of marine reserves at SBCI; (3) estimating mortality rates of lobsters populations throughout the SBCI marine reserve network; and (4) construction of fisheries models that provide context for interpreting mortality rates I estimated. CFR enhanced assessment of marine reserves established in 2003 at the SBCI in terms of their impact in P. interruptus population structure and fishery interactions. After six years of reserve protection, there was a four to eight-fold increase in trap yield, a 5 -- 10% increase in the mean size (carapace length) of legal sized lobsters, and larger size structure of lobsters trapped inside versus outside of three replicate reserves. Patterns in trap data were corroborated by visual SCUBA surveys that indicated a four to six-fold increases in lobster density inside reserves. These results indicate that marine reserves have strong conservation benefits for P. interruptus. Inside reserves, trap performance (the number and mean size of legal-sized lobsters caught in traps) was significantly influenced by proximity to reserve borders, a pattern that suggests net emigration of lobster from inside reserves to adjacent fished areas (spillover). Interestingly, spillover was not apparent in trap yields or commercial fishery effort distribution outside reserves, nor was it apparent in tagging studies. This suggests that spillover from reserves may have little influence of fishery yield outside reserves. However, yield due to spillover might increase as the reserves age and lobster biomass continues to increase inside reserves. Mean total mortality (Z) of female lobsters was lower at sites inside reserves (Z = 0.21 [+/-0.07 SE]) than at sites outside reserves (Z = 0.59 [+/-0.02 SE]). Mean mortality at all sites inside reserves, and among sites near reserve centers (where Z = 0.17 [+/-0.05 SE]), was similar to estimates of natural mortality for other temperate spiny lobster species. Among sites inside reserves, there was a positive relationship between mortality and proximity to reserve borders, but this relationship was absent among sites outside reserves. Mortality estimates were much more variable among sites inside reserves than at sites in fished areas. Results of YPR models suggest that increased effort in this fishery will not result in commensurate increases in yield. However, current spawning potential at SBCI is _20% (of virgin conditions), and this could decrease with increased effort. Our collaborative framework provides a stable and inclusive framework for conducting future research that informs management of this fishery and fosters stakeholder support.",Santa Barbara,-119.6981901,34.4208305,33

Biological sampling of grass rockfish (Sebastes rastrelliger) populations was conducted inside and outside of marine reserves in the Santa Barbara Channel, CA, USA. Model fits to the data demonstrated geographic differences in growth, reproductive maturity and length frequency distributions in two environmentally distinct regions of the channel. A simulation model was developed to test the use of bounded catch curve models to estimate natural and fishing mortality rates using biological data from inside and outside of marine reserves. The models were shown to be robust across life history strategies, variable fishing mortality rates, and stochastic recruitment. These models were applied to collaborative research data on grass rockfish to estimate fishery relevant metrics and the status of the resource in the Santa Barbara Channel. Results indicated that populations in the high and low productivity regions of the channel are undergoing overfishing. The incorporation of marine reserves into these management models reduced the probability of overfishing to minimal levels in the high productivity region, but did not reduce the probability of overfishing to acceptable levels in the low productivity region. A management strategy for using marine reserves to set sustainable catch levels was developed for small-scale, data-poor fisheries. The marine reserve-based decision tree uses length frequency and catch per unit effort data from scientific sampling inside and outside of marine reserves to modify allowable catches on an annual basis to achieve target reference points of fisheries management. Management strategy evaluation (MSE) was performed to demonstrate the utility of this model. Over a 30 year time period, simulation results demonstrated that the use of the reserve-based decision tree consistently achieved higher yields than the current precautionary approach to management while meeting conservation targets.",Santa Barbara,-119.6981901,34.4208305,33

Geography",Geography,Dar A. Roberts,"Urban trees are strategically important in a city's effort to mitigate their carbon footprint, heat island effects, air pollution, and stormwater runoff. Currently, the most common method for quantifying urban forest structure and ecosystem function is through field plot sampling. However, taking intensive structural measurements on private properties throughout a city is difficult, and the outputs from sample inventories are not spatially explicit. The overarching goal of this dissertation is to develop methods for mapping urban forest structure and function using fused hyperspectral imagery and waveform lidar data at the individual tree crown scale. Urban forest ecosystem services estimated using the USDA Forest Service's i-Tree Eco (formerly UFORE) model are based largely on tree species and leaf area index (LAI). Accordingly, tree species were mapped in my Santa Barbara, California study area for 29 species comprising >80% of canopy. Crown-scale discriminant analysis methods were introduced for fusing Airborne Visible Infrared Imaging Spectrometry (AVIRIS) data with a suite of lidar structural metrics (e.g., tree height, crown porosity) to maximize classification accuracy in a complex environment. AVIRIS imagery was critical to achieving an overall species-level accuracy of 83.4% while lidar data was most useful for improving the discrimination of small and morphologically unique species. LAI was estimated at both the field-plot scale using laser penetration metrics and at the crown scale using allometry. Agreement of the former with photographic estimates of gap fraction and the latter with allometric estimates based on field measurements was examined. Results indicate that lidar may be used reasonably to measure LAI in an urban environment lacking in continuous canopy and characterized by high species diversity. Finally, urban ecosystem services such as carbon storage and building energy-use modification were analyzed through combination of aforementioned methods and the i-Tree Eco modeling framework. The remote sensing methods developed in this dissertation will allow researchers to more precisely constrain urban ecosystem spatial analyses and equip cities to better manage their urban forest resource.",Santa Barbara,-119.6981901,34.4208305,33

Hourly total hydrocarbon (THC) data, spanning 1990 to 2008 from an air pollution station located near COP, were analyzed and showed geologic CH4 emissions as the dominant local source. A band ratio approach was developed and applied to high glint AVIRIS data over COP, resulting in local-scale mapping of natural atmospheric CH4 plumes. A Cluster-Tuned Matched Filter (CTMF) technique was applied to Gulf of Mexico AVIRIS data to detect CH4 venting from offshore platforms. Review of 744 platform-centered CTMF subsets was facilitated through a flexible PHP-based web portal.

The historical variability of precipitation in Santa Barbara County is examined on varying timescales and then compared to several phenomena believed to control precipitation in the region. Hourly precipitation data are gathered from seven local stations covering roughly the past forty years (1970--2010). The climatology of precipitation in the region including intensity and persistences of storm episodes is examined. The patterns and variations of precipitations are then compared to three main teleconnection phenomena: the El Nino Southern Oscillation, the Madden-Julian Oscillation, and atmospheric rivers.

Geography",Geography,Konstadinos G. Goulias,"Representation of economic agents and their activity in integrated land-use and transportation models is increasingly becoming disaggregate thereby requiring the corresponding spatial environment also to be represented in much finer detail. This representation can greatly benefit by thoroughly operationalizing and emphasizing the critical element of `location' in better understanding spatial behavior of business establishments within this framework. This dissertation research study strives to contribute to this growing body of knowledge in three major directions. First, presented is a methodological framework that captures for each location properties in-terms of its closeness, intermediacy, straightness and accessibility to all other locations in any study area. Second, we present a modeling approach to comprehensively assess the locational impacts on economic efficiency of business establishments, thereby identifying the highest and lowest performers in the region. Finally, we make a case to use dynamic analysis in thoroughly investigating the spatial dimension of business establishment lifecycle events as related to business establishment formation, relocation and dissolution. Results from this dissertation clearly reveal the presence of a core-periphery (or center-sub center) type of a city model in Santa Barbara County. Furthermore, the results from the network-centrality indicators also suggest that geometric configuration and structure of the transportation network have a prominent role in spatial organization of economic activities in the region. Business establishments' economic efficiency is also significantly influenced (positive or negative) by the relative location in the regional transportation network of each establishment. For instance, retail trade business establishments located in downtown areas of Santa Barbara and Santa Maria have the highest levels of efficiency (maximizing profits) in the region. Moreover, business establishments' internal attributes also have a profound impact of business establishment efficiency, with larger and older business establishments being more efficient than business establishments that are smaller in size and younger in age. Also, access to public transportation in the region has a positive effect on business establishment economic efficiency, especially for business establishments in retail trade, professional and healthcare services. Model estimation results clearly reveal the presence of spatial heterogeneity in business establishment lifecycle events of formation, relocation and dissolution in the region. For instance, highly central locations in the region such as downtown areas have a higher probability of business establishment formation along with lower likelihood for business establishment dissolution. Furthermore, professional service business establishments located along major local and collector roads in these locations are in spatially ""sticky"" locations and survive longer. Overall, however, the results suggest that lifecycle events of business establishments as related to birth, relocation and failure are primarily triggered by changes in business establishment internal attributes.",Santa Barbara,-119.6981901,34.4208305,33

Geography",Geography,Richard Church,"Emergency evacuations are essential for protecting people from hazardous events such as wildfires, tsunamis, hurricanes, industrial accidents, and terrorist actions. One way to assess the effectiveness of an evacuation plan is through mathematical models that represent the road topology, population characteristics, and hazard conditions of a specific geographic area. Current emergency evacuation models are often based upon assumptions about spatial behavior that may poorly represent human actions during an actual evacuation. Our research challenges these assumptions with empirical data from a survey of people in Santa Barbara affected by the Jesusita Fire. The stay-or-go decision of people living in a mandatory evacuation area is of critical importance to emergency managers, thus we use survival analysis to measure the impact of risk perception, distance from the fire, and environmental conditions on this decision. Another critical decision made by evacuees is which route to take when evacuating, thus we analyze empirical evacuation route data and determine which wayfinding strategies were employed by Jesusita Fire evacuees. We develop a Rayleigh probability model and a network flow model based on the results of these analyses, which are integrated with a traffic microsimulation of our study area. This simulation allows us to generate evacuation time estimates that explicitly account for behavioral uncertainty, and to assess the effectiveness of different traffic management strategies. The objectives of this research are to develop a better understanding of spatial behavior during an emergency evacuation, and develop new models that may help reduce evacuation vulnerability.",Santa Barbara,-119.6981901,34.4208305,33

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Alexander Simms,"Establishing sea-cliff erosion rates is a vital component of coastal zone management. Laser scanning technology can provide a fast, reliable, and accurate means to survey sea-cliffs covering large areas of the coastline and to establish local erosion rates. The technology allows for the rapid laterally continuous survey of sea-cliffs with Dynamic Laser Scanning (DLS) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) surveys. Data collected from DLS and LiDAR surveys for southern Santa Barbara County were compared in a Geographic Information System (GIS). This study establishes regional erosion rates using NOAA LiDAR data along southern Santa Barbara County coastal bluffs from Point Conception to Rincon Point (Carpinteria, California). Regional retreat rates for southern Santa Barbara County calculated in GIS from 1998 and 2010 NOAA LiDAR data range from 4 to 73 cm yr-1. Local erosion rates were also established along Lagoon Road on the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) campus and at Point Conception. The average retreat rate at UCSB calculated from 1997 LiDAR and 2012 DLS data was 24 cm yr-1. Areas along Lagoon Road protected by rip rap have lower average retreat rates of 15 cm yr-1. The Lagoon Road retreat rates are similar to manually surveyed rates along these same cliffs. Erosion rates along the Lagoon Road sea-cliff with active drain pipes, seepage, and tree falls were expected to experience higher cliff erosion rates than sections of the sea-cliff without these influences, but the results of this study did not confirm my hypothesis. Retreat rates at Lagoon Road were higher than retreat rates at Point Conception. The higher rates are attributed to the presence of excessive surface runoff and the orientation of the dip of the beds. Comparison of 100 m of overlapping DLS data along Lagoon Road from November 2011 and January 2012 suggests that the top of the cliff is retreating at a higher rate than the base, which is a consequence of excess surface runoff. The aspect of the sea-cliff was also found to have an influence on erosion rates, with higher retreat rates correlating to south facing sea-cliffs. Unless measures are taken to impede the current rate of erosion along Lagoon Road, the road will be undercut in 60 years.",Santa Barbara,-119.6981901,34.4208305,33

Linguistics",Linguistics,Matthew Gordon,"Lateral and rhotic consonants have been known to pattern together as liquids since the Ancient Greek grammarian Dionysius Thrax (Walsh 1997; Proctor 2009). Synchronic and diachronic processes which affect one liquid in a language are likely to affect all liquids in the language. The English rhotic [r\\] has been shown to epenthesize in post-vocalic environments, such as in idear or drawring, a phenomenon known as intrusive-R. This rhotic also lenites in other dialects in words like quart and mother (Gick 1999). In parallel, the English lateral [l] may be epenthesized in a rarer, but documented, phenomenon known as intrusive-L, which affects the same environments as intrusive-R (Gick 2002). Similarly, coda-L is optionally pronounced in some words such as folk, palm, and calm, suggesting a similar process of lenition. While it is well-established that the English rhotic [r/] may serve as the syllable peak in certain words such as church, bird, and verb, little work as investigated the possibility of a lateral syllable peak in analogous words such as milk, filled, and help. The current study examines coda-position liquids in closed syllables from native California speakers in the Santa Barbara Corpus of Spoken American English (Du Bois et al. 2000, 2003, 2004, 2005) to create a model predicting liquid sonority based on liquid type, speaker gender, lexical stress, and other phonological features. Additionally, following MRI work by Gick et al. (2002), the formant values of liquids are examined to determine the similarity of liquids to vowels and the influence adjacent vowels may have on the shape of a liquid. Given that coda-position [r/] may be the syllable peak in certain closed syllables, we expect coda-position [l] to behave similarly. Finally, since the findings of Gick et al. (2002) suggest that the articulation of /r// and /l/ are most similar to /[schwa]/ and /[open o]/, respectively, it is predicted that the formant structure of these sonorous liquids will mirror the formant structure of these two vowels. The results indicate that liquids in Californian English exhibit similar patterns regarding sonority under certain conditions, although rhotics may be more vowel-like than laterals.",Santa Barbara,-119.6981901,34.4208305,33

Marine Science",Marine Science,David A. Siegel,"CDOM dynamics in the SBC were assessed for a 15-year study period, and this work shows that significantly large MAA Index values, e.g. MAA Index > 1, were present in approximately 16% of surface water data. Variability in CDOM spectral shape was quantified using the EOF technique, and regression analysis with EOF outputs showed that CDOM absorption intensity and spectral shape were well correlated dinoflagellate presence. Furthermore, results showed that phytoplankton biomass played a secondary role in relation to CDOM absorption, and that variability in CDOM absorption coefficients were primarily driven by community composition. CDOM quality in the SBC was also assessed using CDOM fluorescence properties via excitation emission matrix spectroscopy (EEMS). The EEMS data was analyzed using a multivariate statistical procedure, again, an EOF analysis, to identify three dominant CDOM source regimes: the surface pelagic regime, deep-water (up to 300 m) regime and kelp forest pelagic regime. This work also found that while CDOM absorption coefficient was strongly influence by which phytoplankton groups were present, DOM quality was characterized more so by the amount of phytoplankton biomass, hence indicating strong microbial component to DOM production. Lastly, with the use of the EEMS data, and characterization of CDOM absorption properties, e.g. spectral slope, S, slope ratio, SR, specific UV-absorbance, SUVA and MAA Index, we found that terrestrial sources of CDOM were very limited in the SBC. Based on this research, mineral particle concentrations that significantly correlated with IOPs were thought to be associated with suspended sediments from shoaling of the continental shelf rather than from stream/river influence. Thus, the SBC is a unique, optically complex ocean system where IOP dynamics, thus remote sensing reflectance, are strongly influenced by shifts in phytoplankton community structure. The research presented in this dissertation evaluates the direct relationships of phytoplankton community composition and inherent optical properties (IOP); that is, the absorption and scattering of light in the ocean. Phytoplankton community composition affect IOPs in both direct and indirect ways, thus creating challenges for optical measurements of biological and biogeochemical properties in aquatic systems. Studies were performed in the Santa Barbara Channel (SBC), CA where an array of optical and biogeochemical measurements were made. Phytoplankton community structure was characterized by an empirical orthogonal functional analysis (EOF) using phytoplankton accessory pigments. The results showed that phytoplankton community significantly correlated to all IOPs, e.g. phytoplankton specific absorption, detrital absorption, CDOM absorption and particle backscattering coefficients. Furthermore, the EOF analysis was unique in splitting the microphytoplankton size class into separate diatom and dinoflagellate regimes allowing for assessment optical property differences within the same size class, a technique previously not systematically achievable. The phytoplankton functional group dinoflagellates were particularly influential to IOPs in surprising ways. Dinoflagellates showed higher backscattering efficiencies than would be predicted based on Mie theory, and significantly influenced CDOM absorption via direct association with dissolved mycosproine-like amino acid absorption (MAA) peaks in CDOM spectra. A new index was developed in this work to quantify MAA absorption peaks in CDOM spectra, and was named the MAA Index. Prior to this research dissolved MAA absorption in natural waters was never quantified, and CDOM data containing these peaks were often disregarded and discarded from analysis.",Santa Barbara,-119.6981901,34.4208305,33

The role of physical transport in exporting chlorophyll biomass to depth was evaluated in the Santa Barbara Channel using data from 16 seasonal cruises during the Santa Barbara Coastal Long Term Ecological Research project (SBC-LTER). Measurements included surveys of CTD casts, towed transects using instrumented, undulating vehicles (ScanFish and TRIAXUS), surface currents from an array of high-frequency radars, and an underway acquisition system for near-surface water properties, meteorological variables, and currents from ship-board acoustic Doppler current profilers. Data from highly-resolved towed transects were calibrated using the complementary CTD data; in particular, calibrations were obtained for chlorophyll fluorometers on the towed profilers. Data from the towed profilers were interpolated onto a regular grid using ordinary Kriging. By combining Kriged data sets with euphotic zone depths from the CTD grids, the fraction of total chlorophyll biomass below the euphotic zone was estimated for the channel-wide surveys and compared among cruises, with a minimum of 8%, a maximum of 41%, and a mean of 24% (+/-11%) of chlorophyll found at depth for an entire cruise.

Sociology",Sociology,"William I. Robinson, Juan-Vicente Palerm","This dissertation examines the interplay between processes of globalization and transnational migration and their impact at the micro level in the understudied area of gendered household economic strategies in both sending and receiving communities. Drawing on a multi-sited ethnography study which employed a two-phase mixed methods approach, I analyzed migration histories, occupational mobility, migration dispersion in the U.S., and household economic strategies, in two transnational communities: 1) Acayahualco, Guerrero Mexico and Santa Barbara, CA and 2) Mayanalan, Guerrero Mexico and Wilmington, DE. To ascertain key socio-demographic features of the populations under study, I developed a 162-item survey that I administered to 90 households in the sending communities of Guerrero, Mexico. The survey results were both complemented and challenged by my multi-sited ethnographic research comprising 50 in-depth interviews, along with participant observation in the sending and receiving communities. This study offers two contributions to sociology: in the one hand it examines the ways in which globalization takes place at the local level, specifically in the social context of international migration. By undertaking this type of dialectic analysis of the global and the local, this study sheds light on the individual's response capabilities and, more importantly, on their agency power in the face of global processes. This proactive agency on the part of the transnational migrant families becomes evident as they are observed looking constantly for ways to ""stretch their limited resources"" to cover expenses by relying on their unlimited resourcefulness. In this context, international migration should not be viewed simply as a survival strategy for peasant families, but, as a mechanism of reaction and resistance against global capitalism barriers. On the other hand, I demonstrated throughout this work, the social phenomenon of international migration in these two communities, and within their domestic units, is the result of an accumulative and uninterrupted process that has been shaped by a vast number of learning experiences, social and cultural exchanges, and innovative and resourceful practices to cope with the challenges of becoming transnational. The transnational perspective allows us to underscore how, in spite of being physically separated by great distances, the development of household economic strategies by migrants and their families are deeply linked. This transnational linkage allows migrants and their families in their communities of origins to cope with the challenges of a globalized economy that has been detrimental to their living conditions. In this sense, the results of my study counter the view that sees migrants and their families in their communities of origin as puppets controlled by forces beyond their own control. Rather, this study emphasizes how migrants and their families with hard-working ethics look for opportunities to improve their socioeconomic circumstances and enhance their living conditions.",Santa Barbara,-119.6981901,34.4208305,33

Self-formulations provide recipients with an ""official account"" of what a person is about to do, has done (or tried to do), or is involved with doing.

Results indicated that child gender and children's perceived social support were significant predictors of children's emotional symptoms as reported by children, but not as reported by parents.

Environmental Science and Management",Environmental Science and Management,Christina Tague,"In water-stressed semi-arid areas, the impact of urbanization on ecohydrologic processes such as vegetation water use and net primary productivity is of concern. This dissertation seeks to increase understanding of ecohydrologic processes within an urban and semi-arid context through the application of an ecohydrological model (the Regional Ecohydrologic Simulation System, RHESSys) to the Mission Creek catchment in Santa Barbara County, CA. The analysis first quantifies the impact of uncertainties from both calibrated soil parameters and inputs (precipitation scaling, temperature, and outdoor water use) on model output. I find that the relative impact of different sources of uncertainty varies throughout the water year and with the model output of interest. Early in the water year (Oct-Nov), soils are relatively dry and soil parameters exert a strong control on streamflow. As the rainy season progresses and soils become more saturated, streamflow becomes more sensitive to uncertainty in the scaling of precipitation with elevation. In the spring and summer months, modeled ET becomes more sensitive to calibrated soil parameters and outdoor water use as plant water demands increase and soil water stores are utilized for ET. I next devised and tested a series of alternative calibration approaches aimed at reducing the potential for observation and input error to introduce bias in the calibration process. I find that valuing stability of model performance across the calibration period results in the selection of soil parameters with more consistent performance between calibration and evaluation periods. I also find that filtering periods of suspected error or model weakness from the calibration period will greatly alter the distribution of acceptable parameter sets. Surprisingly, calibrating across a range of precipitation scaling uncertainty does not change the relative performance of different parameter sets. Finally, I use the calibrated model to conduct an analysis of the role of effective impervious surface area (EIA) on vegetation water use and productivity. I demonstrate that connectivity between impervious areas and the drainage network can influence modeled vegetation water use and productivity: reducing the EIA fraction of total impervious area increases runoff infiltration and can mitigate or even cancel reduction in vegetation water use and NPP directly due to vegetation loss with increased impervious surface coverage. My results indicate that runoff from impervious surfaces into neighboring vegetated areas can increase transpiration and NPP in these vegetated areas well into the dry season. As an extended dry season is common to Mediterranean sites, this finding is of interest with regards to maximizing vegetation productivity in water stressed urban areas while minimizing the need for additional water inputs from irrigation. A first order approximation of the EIA fraction into a catchment scale model indicates that the effect of accounting for the EIA fraction on model ET and NPP estimates will vary between wet and dry years, with an increasing effect during wet years and a minimal effect during dry years.",Santa Barbara County,-119.6981901,34.4208305,5

Laser scanning technology can provide a fast, reliable, and accurate means to survey sea-cliffs covering large areas of the coastline and to establish local erosion rates. The technology allows for the rapid laterally continuous survey of sea-cliffs with Dynamic Laser Scanning (DLS) and Light Detection and Ranging (LiDAR) surveys. Data collected from DLS and LiDAR surveys for southern Santa Barbara County were compared in a Geographic Information System (GIS). This study establishes regional erosion rates using NOAA LiDAR data along southern Santa Barbara County coastal bluffs from Point Conception to Rincon Point (Carpinteria, California). Regional retreat rates for southern Santa Barbara County calculated in GIS from 1998 and 2010 NOAA LiDAR data range from 4 to 73 cm yr-1. Local erosion rates were also established along Lagoon Road on the University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB) campus and at Point Conception. The average retreat rate at UCSB calculated from 1997 LiDAR and 2012 DLS data was 24 cm yr-1. Areas along Lagoon Road protected by rip rap have lower average retreat rates of 15 cm yr-1. The Lagoon Road retreat rates are similar to manually surveyed rates along these same cliffs. Erosion rates along the Lagoon Road sea-cliff with active drain pipes, seepage, and tree falls were expected to experience higher cliff erosion rates than sections of the sea-cliff without these influences, but the results of this study did not confirm my hypothesis. Retreat rates at Lagoon Road were higher than retreat rates at Point Conception. The higher rates are attributed to the presence of excessive surface runoff and the orientation of the dip of the beds. Comparison of 100 m of overlapping DLS data along Lagoon Road from November 2011 and January 2012 suggests that the top of the cliff is retreating at a higher rate than the base, which is a consequence of excess surface runoff. The aspect of the sea-cliff was also found to have an influence on erosion rates, with higher retreat rates correlating to south facing sea-cliffs. Unless measures are taken to impede the current rate of erosion along Lagoon Road, the road will be undercut in 60 years.",Santa Barbara County,-119.6981901,34.4208305,5

Anthropology",Anthropology,Michael A.

Differing intensities of human occupation at SCRI-195 and SCRI-496 defined harvesting pressure on M. californianus beds, and the frequency and intensity of upwelling conditions (cooler SST) influenced past productivity of M. californianus during the Late Holocene at each site location. This study reached the conclusion that the factors of site occupation dynamics and upwelling occurrence together influenced human foraging on M. californianus during the Late Holocene around Santa Cruz Island and explain variation in archaeological shellfish assemblages. This study evaluates this proposal through the study of archeological, ecological and stable isotopic data from two shell midden sites, SCRI-195 and SCRI-496, on the coast of Santa Cruz island, both occupied during the Late Holocene (2200-500 cal B.P.). The correlation between changes in abundance and size of M. californianus and past sea surface temperature (SST) through the chronological sequences at each archaeological site was statistically evaluated, regional and local SST records spanning the Late Holocene were compared, and modern data concerning ecological and oceanographic factors affecting M. californianus productivity around Santa Cruz island were used to interpret past natural conditions of this shellfish species. The results of this study show that fluctuation in regional and local past SST does not explain variation in abundance or length of collected M. californianus through the occupation of SCRI-195 and SCRI-496. Archaeologists working on the northern Channel Islands of California have proposed that during the Late Holocene, foraging decisions of the islands' prehistoric occupants were progressively less affected by environmental changes as increasing human exploitation pressure shaped abundance and size of intertidal shellfish species. This proposal, although supported by archaeological data from habitation sites, does not incorporate past small-scale ecological and oceanographic variability around the islands nor the effect of this variability on Mytilus californianus (California mussel), the main intertidal shellfish species exploited through prehistory.

Glassow,"The Chumash living in the Santa Barbara Channel region at the time of European contact in AD 1542, and into the Early Historic period (AD 1782-1834), are described in historic documents as living a sedentary lifestyle settled in large, permanent villages. Although archaeologists working in the region today have a number of historical sources and ethnographic records to contextualize their work, little archaeological research using modern excavation and laboratory techniques has been undertaken, and much remains unknown about how the Chumash organized their households and communities and constructed economic, political, and social relationships. Results indicate that the houses were occupied by fewer individuals than was typical, although residents of the village did invest substantial labor at the sites, constructing houses and possibly a small sweat lodge. This suggests that while occupation may not have been permanent, it was significant. Residents were involved in a number of activities including the production of shell beads and ornaments, the production and maintenance of stone tools, and the collection and processing of plant and animal foods. Additionally, an analysis of the activities in which the community was engaged reveals how residents created and maintained their identity through daily practice against the backdrop of significant social, political, and economic transformation in colonial-era California. Recently, a few late prehistoric and historic sites on the Northern Channel Islands have been identified and recorded away from permanent village sites. Three of these small sites (SCRI-324, -384, -801) located in the interior of Santa Cruz Island are believed to represent the Early Historic period village of Nimatlala. These sites appear to be very different from other Early Historic period villages in that they contain smaller house depressions and shallow midden deposits. Excavation of houses and deposits at SCRI-324 and SCRI-384 was undertaken in an effort to discern the chronology of occupation, the organization of households and the community as a whole, and the nature of activities undertaken at the site.",Santa Cruz,-122.0307963,36.9741171,6

The integration of a multiscalar chronological framework and multiple lines of subsistence data provides a unique methodological approach for investigating the role of seasonal subsistence stability in population regulation. Each line of evidence helps in unraveling a complex story of human occupation and foraging behavior at three archaeological sites that I excavated. A thorough and rigorous program of radiometric dating and Bayesian chronological models control the century-level resolution and site seasonality studies based on oxygen isotope analysis the provide seasonal resolution, necessary to infer diachronic shifts in mobility patterns. I also rely on and highlight the importance of analyzing and integrating both faunal and macrobotanical data in order to answer questions of resource exploitation and dietary sufficiency. Together these diverse lines of mobility and subsistence data allow me to reconstruct significant diachronic changes in foraging behavior and evaluate these changes with respect to evidence of climate-induced environmental change and prehistoric population growth. These results suggest that prehistoric human population growth did not always instigate major shifts in food acquisition, but rather was, in some cases, a product of subtle changes in the type, quantity, and quality of food resources upon which human foragers relied. Although this research specifically evaluates dietary and foraging behaviors on Santa Cruz Island, the broad theoretical perspective that macro-scale population level shifts among hunter-gatherers may be an unintended outcome of subtle shifts in foraging behavior---related to a variety of social, environmental, or economic variables---that inform dynamic biological processes is widely applicable to hunter-gatherer studies. Ultimately, this research sheds new light on how significant demographic shifts occurred throughout human history, prior to the adoption of domesticated foods. This archaeological dissertation research project integrates a rigorous chronological framework, geochemical data, and subsistence data to evaluate dynamic interrelationships between foodways, the environment, and human population growth in prehistory. Specifically, this case study elucidates temporal variation in risk-reducing foraging behaviors relative to a period of significant and intrinsic population growth ca. 1600 cal B.P. on the Northern Channel Islands of California.

Anthropology",Anthropology,Michael A. Glassow,"Considering arguments that the unique ecological conditions that exist in maritime environments encouraged reduced residential mobility and hastened the development of socially and politically complex hunter-gatherer societies examination of the development of settlement and foraging organization can help clarify our understanding of social and cultural evolution in maritime contexts. The Northern Channel Islands of California consist of four landmasses with relatively profound environmental variation and are therefore well positioned to evaluate mobility in a maritime context. While previous mobility hypotheses have been formed for the Early Holocene (7500-10,000 BP) on the Northern Channel Islands, these hypotheses included minimal data from Santa Cruz Island, the largest and most environmentally diverse landmass within the Northern Channel Island chain. Yet, data from this island are important because the Northern Channel Islands vary in size, environment, and biodiversity. These differences can have a profound effect on foraging and mobility. This is an important issue within anthropology, as generalization of adaptive behavior does not account for local variants that can play a crucial role in cultural development. To evaluate the nature of mobility during the Early Holocene on Santa Cruz Island resource exploitation, land use, seasonality, and intensity of occupation were examined through artifactual, faunal, and floral data collected during excavations at the five known Early Holocene deposits on Santa Cruz Island. Analyses based on these data included density and diversity analyses of all material, dietary reconstruction using meat weight measures, lithic analysis using size grade ratios, archaeobotanical analysis, oxygen isotope analysis, radiocarbon dating, and various other quantitative measures that were used in both intra- and inter-sites comparisons. Interpretations of these analyses argue that subsistence and settlement decisions were based on locally available resources and the Early Holocene hunter-gatherers on Santa Cruz Island utilized a residentially mobile settlement strategy. The more complex, logistically organized settlement systems of later time periods probably had not yet developed by the end of the Early Holocene on Santa Cruz Island.",Santa Cruz,-122.0307963,36.9741171,6

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Douglas W. Burbank,"Oversteepened, convex segments of stream channels called knickpoints have been utilized as markers that commonly migrate upstream and delineate abrupt changes in erosional efficiency influenced by base-level fall, changes in rock strength, or strong spatial variations in discharge. Currently, few analyses based on DEMs enable discrimination among migrating knickpoints related to changes in external forcing (baselevel fall, stream capture, and climate) versus fixed knickpoints related to internal forcing within a catchment (resistant bedrock units, coarse debris flow run-outs at tributary junctions, or landslide dams). Furthermore, few analyses have characterized the extent that migratory knickpoints steepen downstream-adjacent hillslopes. To study these interactions, we exploit a 1-m resolution LiDAR DEM of Santa Cruz Island (SCI), CA and a new algorithm that automatically extracts and measures the dimensions of any knickpoint in a regional DEM. The algorithm reduces knickpoint selection time by >99% and removes selection bias from the traditional means of regional knickpoint identification that relies on visual inspections of individual longitudinal profiles. The spatial pattern of knickpoints located by the algorithm highlight three dominant knickpoint-forming processes on SCI: knickpoints fixed to contacts between rocks of different strength, knickpoints migrating upstream from an incision pulse caused by a significant stream capture event, and mobile knickpoints stemming from relative sea-level fall and wave erosion of sea-cliffs. Nearly 36% of the hillslope area downstream from migratory knickpoints has slopes above threshold values of 35, and on average, these regions display a 4-6 steeper median hillslope-gradient than hillslopes upstream from migratory knickpoints. Hillslope-gradient histograms are nearly identical upstream and downstream from knickpoints fixed to spatial changes in rock strength or when re-analyzing hillslopes surrounding migratory knickpoints with a 10-m resolution DEM. From regionally extensive map of stream knickpoints, geological context, and hillslope attributes extracted from a 1-m resolution DEM, new insights emerge on the controls of landscape evolution; insights that would be much harder to obtain through individual knickpoint selection or lower resolution imagery.",Santa Cruz,-122.0307963,36.9741171,6

Anthropology",Anthropology,Michael A. Glassow,"Ancient plant use among the Island Chumash is much less well understood than other aspects of islander lifeways. There is a long history of research on faunal assemblages from Island Chumash sites, whereas comparatively little paleoethnobotanical research has been done. The resulting disparity in faunal vs. floral data combined with field observations of an island landscape ravaged by historical overgrazing, led various researchers to suggest that island plant foods were too marginal to support island populations and that mainland plant foods, subsequently, may have been a major motivating factor behind cross-channel exchange networks and increased sociopolitical complexity seen later in time. Within the context of optimal foraging theory and diet breadth models, I explore the significance of plant foods to the Island Chumash of Santa Cruz Island, using archaeological and paleoethnobotanical data from three sites with bedrock mortars, located in upland and interior areas. These non-coastal sites occur in some of the most productive terrestrial areas on the island, representing a range of time periods and site types: a logistical encampment (Sunburst -- AD 1260-1500); an interior residence (Brodiaea Ridge, 4330 BC-AD 1630); and, a village (Diablo Valdez, 3920 BC-AD 1800). Deep, well-stratified deposits and excellent preservation of domestic features (i.e., roasting pits, hearth clearing pits, structural floor) at Diablo Valdez provide a high-resolution record of archaeological and paleoethnobotanical remains, where I was unable to identify any significant change in plant food subsistence for nearly 6,000 years. Brodiaea corms were the most ubiquitous taxon identified at this site, sometimes occurring in great abundance and associated with large roasting pit features. Here, I argue that carbohydrate content, rather than caloric value, may be a more appropriate currency for ranking plant foods in island contexts, where abundant marine resources provided ample fats and protein. In this scheme, the ranking of plant foods on the northern Channel Islands, in terms of optimal foraging and island archaeobotanical data (ranked high to low) are: 1) geophytes; 2) kelps and seaweeds; 3) small seeds; 4) fruits, berries, and non-toxic pits; 5) leaves, stems, and stalks; 6) toxic nuts and pits; 7) non-toxic nuts; and, 8) aquatic roots/rhizomes. While there is a preservation bias between these various plant food categories, this general ranking scheme appears to be supported in the island archaeobotanical record. As Channel Island vegetation communities recover form more than a century of overgrazing, it has become clear that the phenomenally abundant geophyte resources that occur on the islands are significantly larger and denser than their mainland counterparts in the absence of gophers, moles, ground squirrels, deer, and other terrestrial herbivores. The brodiaeas are particularly well represented in archaeobotanical assemblages for the islands, used for at least 10,000 years and harvested in multiple seasons. The diversity and unparalleled abundance of island geophyte resources would have provided easily procurable and substantial carbohydrates for the Island Chumash and their ancestors. Combined with the diverse and abundant edible marine plants and algae surrounding the islands, geophytes and other island plants provided the Island Chumash with ample food, medicine, and raw materials that were more abundant and stable than previously assumed.",Santa Cruz Island,-119.7657663,34.0232056,1

Normalized stream steepness indices (ksn) of major channels west of the SBSYF (~46) are close to half of those east of the SBSYF (~78). A Kolmogorov-Smirnov Test on ksn values from either side of the SBSYF rejects the null hypothesis of no statistical difference at the 99% level. Additionally, the SBSYF corresponds to an abrupt eastward increase (~350m) in mountain crest elevation and the only water gap that crosses the western Santa Ynez Mountains. A beach exposure of the SBSYF reveals a ~4 m thick fault gauge dipping ~76 to the south and an abrupt 1-2 m increase in modern marine platform elevation east of the fault. I conclude that the SBSYF likely represents a significant and active tectonic boundary that separates two distinct segments of the Gaviota Coast and is a significantly greater hazard than suggested in the published literature.",Santa Ynez,-120.079868,34.6144313,1

Education",Education,John Yun,"The purpose of this study is to explore the self-efficacy of Saudi businesswomen and advocates at the Saudi Arabian regional Chambers of Commerce and Industry and to contribute to our understanding of how Saudi Arabian women leaders develop over time. Through Bandura's self-efficacy framework (2005) and its effect on two key generational cohorts of women advocates, much can be learned about those women leaders advocating for the rights of Saudi businesswomen. My focus on self-efficacy of these two Generational Cohorts came from a pilot study (Alfrayan, 2013) on the self-efficacy component of leadership among Saudi businesswomen in three main regions in Saudi Arabia, Riyadh, Jeddah, and the Eastern province. The pilot study yielded evidence of the existence of two distinct Generational Cohorts among the Participants. The two Generational Cohorts are characterized by the event of the establishment of a women section that provided services to businesswomen. It is important to note that different geographic regions established women sections at their local chamber of commerce on different dates. Thus, the generations are not defined by time, but by context. Focus is given to how these leaders describe the development of their self-efficacy and what they chose to do with it. For the purpose of this study, the Generational Cohorts of the Participants were added as a dimension to understand how self-efficacy compares between generations. Using a Quantitative case study approach to closely studying six cases of two generational cohorts in three geographical locations was preformed. Applying Bandura's (1995) self-efficacy framework as the lens for examining the leadership development of businesswomen and professionals in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in two generations by researching the following questions were answered: What do Saudi Arabian businesswomen and advocates identify as the most important factors furthering and hindering the development of their self-efficacy to advocate for a larger role for women in business? and In what ways do these women leaders describe the two Generational Cohorts of women advocate's effects on one another?",Saudi Arabia,45.079162,23.885942,2

Global and International Studies",Global and International Studies,Paul Amar,"This paper looks at small arms transfers to non-state actors in the Syrian conflict as an under analyzed aspect of intervention in intrastate war that is both globalized and potentially destabilizing. I challenge the dominant narrative that the international community has failed to intervene in Syria, by pointing to the manifold government-funded arms transfers to opposition groups beginning in 2012. I find that there are two significant networks of arms trafficking: one through Jordan with Saudi Arabian and American support; the other through Turkey with Qatari support. These patterns and rivalries between donor countries have contributed to three processes within the transformation from revolution to civil war: militarization, increased sectarianism, and fragmentation of the opposition. I review two mechanisms of international arms control: multilateral embargoes and the recent Arms Trade Treaty. Their weaknesses, as evident in the case of Syria, are related to the problems of self-monitoring and enforcement by states that have contradictory incentives. Next, I address the related issue of surplus arms by looking at how the failure of disarmament measures in Iraq and Libya had a direct impact on arms proliferation in Syria. I conclude with a discussion of the legality of arms transfers to non-state actors and the need to focus on political rather than military solutions to globalized conflict.",Saudi Arabia,45.079162,23.885942,2

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Jordan Clark,"The current drought crisis in California highlights the vulnerability of freshwater resources, particularly groundwater reservoirs, which supply up to 60% of California's water during drought years. Understanding the potential impacts of climate change on groundwater recharge and storage is critical as drought periods become more frequent in the state. Groundwater residence times provide insight into groundwater recharge and transport mechanisms and storage capacities. This study developed and evaluated a new intrinsic tracer method to quantify groundwater recharge and transport using the occurrence of the naturally-produced radioisotope sulfur-35 (35S, half-life 87.5 days) in water as dissolved sulfate (35SO4). Improvements made to established analytical techniques expand the analytical range of 35SO4, which broadens the utility of 35SO 4 as a hydrologic tracer. The 35SO4 tracer method was applied to two distinct hydrologic settings: 1) high-elevation Sierra Nevada basins, and 2) low-elevations basins containing managed aquifer recharge (MAR) facilities. In the Sierra Nevada study, the new 35SO4 method was used to empirically constrain annual groundwater recharge in Sagehen Creek Basin (SCB) and Martis Valley Groundwater Basin (MVGB). Compared to relatively high 5SO4 activity in seasonal snowmelt (5.5 +/- 0.3 to 52.9 +/- 3.4 mBq/L), groundwater and surface water consistently yielded low 35SO4 activities resulting in a calculated percent new snowmelt (PNS) of <30%. The consistently low PNS suggests that recent (<1 year old) snowmelt represents only a small fraction of the larger aquifer system. As snowpack continues to decline due to climate change, streamflow and springs may respond in a two phase manner: rapid response in discharge followed by more gradual decreases over decades due to declines in groundwater recharge. The MAR study used 35SO4 to quantify groundwater travel times near MAR operations. MAR sites divert excess surface water, imported water, and reclaimed wastewater into surface-spreading ponds or direct injection wells to replenish groundwater in heavy-usage areas. Identifying groundwater travel times near MAR facilities is critical for determining the fate and transport of potential contaminants, especially for facilities that incorporate a significant portion of reclaimed wastewater. Successful application of the 35SO4 tracer method near MAR sites is dependent on careful characterization of the 35SO4 activity in source waters. Relative to established deliberate tracer experiments, which require extensive field and laboratory effort, the less intensive 35SO 4 technique showed comparable groundwater travel times at two MAR facilities located in southern California. Both the Sierra Nevada and MAR studies demonstrate that 35SO4 is a valuable, yet underutilized tracer in hydrologic studies.",Sierra Nevada,-82.5536875,35.4307844,1

Environmental Science and Management",Environmental Science and Management,Christina Tague,"This dissertation improves the understanding of how accounting for fine-scale variability of topography and soil is important for modeling ecohydrologic responses to climate change and variability in California's Sierra Nevada watersheds. In the first chapter, I apply the Regional Hydrologic-Ecologic Simulation System (RHESSys) to eight small watersheds and investigate how the spatial resolution of digital elevation model (DEM) resolution affects the accuracy of modeling streamflow and model estimates of ecohydrologic responses to inter-annual climate variability. Modeled streamflow estimates become worse with DEM resolution coarser than 10m, the explanation lying in the corresponding reduction in the spatial variance of the wetness index. In the second chapter, I use Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) to investigate the effect of soil parameter uncertainty in modeling ecohydrologic estimates in the two small watersheds with different snow regimes. The predictive uncertainty of annual evapotranspiration and net primary production estimates for a transient snow watershed are larger than those for a snow-dominated watershed, but the predictive uncertainty in model estimates for daily streamflow is larger for the snow-dominated watershed. The effect of soil parameter uncertainty varies seasonally, between wet and dry years, and its effect on ecohydrologic estimates is often large relative to the effect of climate warming. In the third chapter, I investigate the different hydrologic responses to climate warming between a snow-dominated watershed and a transient snow watershed. The modeling results show that the snow-dominated watershed has greater sensitivity to climate warming than the transient snow watershed. In the both watersheds, leaf area index and wetness index are primary factors controlling spatial patterns of seasonal evapotranspiration under both of historical climate conditions and climate warming scenarios. Climate warming results in increased spatial variability in monthly evapotranspiration, especially in the summer period. In the last chapter, I develop a strategic sampling design for collecting soil moisture and sapflux data to capture watershed ecohydrologic responses to inter-annual climate variability in a transient snow watershed. The comparison of model-based calculated hydrological similarity indicators with measured values shows that spatial patterns of field-sampled soil moisture data are similar to those of model-based estimates. However, the model fails to capture the soil moisture and sapflux dynamics in the riparian zone site, and in a site where lateral subsurface flow may not follow surface topography. Future research will reduce these errors by the use of finer-scale representations of microclimate, topography, vegetation, and soil properties in the model.",Sierra Nevada County,-121.0538368,39.1415618,1

Religious Studies",Religious Studies,Wade Clark Roof,"Social science research in religion seems to be losing sight of the middle ground where institutions and individuals interact and thus struggles to offer a constructive response to the dilemmas facing scholars of religion more generally. In response, this dissertation aims to bolster the efforts of those calling for an examination of the connections between lived religion and institutional fields. Viewing religion as a field or network visible through the interaction of individuals and institutions within it makes clear the object of social research and indicates a reflexive method for ethnographic research. Specifically, it is proposed that: (a) religion in general is a discursive field or network of communication and communicative action, definable only within its specific situation; (b) a ""religion"" in particular is a set of cohesive segmentary social networks characterized by discourse and communicative action in service of whatever is situationally defined as religious (most typically involving motivations and purposes commonly apprehended as related to the ultimate conditions of human existence); (c) lived religion, therefore, is empirically visible to the scholar solely through language and behavior by agents acting within those social networks; and (d) because of his or her active role in perceiving and interacting with and within the social networks that structure religious fields, the empirical scholar inherently and inevitably is a part of the field itself, which simply cannot exist without the relationship between the researcher and the object of study. These claims are illustrated with case studies using a variety of empirical methods; many underlying concerns remain the same regardless of how a particular situation is examined. Two cases (Japanese mizuko kuyo rituals and the True Love Waits chastity campaign) are based on analysis of primary and secondary sources, three others in ethnographic field research (Jews in postsocialist Slovakia, a ""Generation X"" church, and a Jewish seeker service), and one case (the Jewish emergent phenomenon) in a combination. The cases illustrate how to define and study religion empirically when it seems to be visible primarily in the interstitial middle ground where people articulate their sense of self and negotiate their relationships with one another.",Slovakia,19.699024,48.669026,1

Geography",Geography,Keith C. Clarke,"This study investigates the impact of policy on interaction between land use and road network changes over time within cities. Policy, in this study, has been defined as the combination of the regional level government programs and political history which affects the pattern of urbanization in a region. The study focuses on urbanization in a politically volatile region that juxtaposes two completely different interaction regimes in a single city and explores the dynamics of the road network as determined by land use change. Land use change studies usually compare the landscape across different time periods and investigate the transitions and proportions of change among land use classes. Yet intensification and enhancement of the underlying road network directly influences the land use in terms of type and location. In particular, the aim of the study is to demonstrate how land use maps can be integrated in time and space, and across an international boundary (Italy/Slovenia) to better integrate policy differences into urban systems models in general and cellular automata models. While urban dynamics have been extensively researched and simulated, the development of the road network is usually exogenous to the modeling or is ignored entirely. The primary analysis is been conducted using maps and imagery of the adjacent cities of Gorizia, Italy and Nova Gorica, Slovenia, twin towns historically divided by a political border, a line that has changed in its degree of separation from extreme during the Cold War, to minimal today. To link the findings with modeling, the SLEUTH model has been adapted to simulate the policy impacts on urbanization, allowing experimentation with incorporating policy into cellular automata models. Further, multiple network analysis indices and measures of spatial association are used to understand the relationship between change in land use and road networks. The study was able to successfully demonstrate impact of policy on urbanization and the results show that policy influences the land use change and road networks individually but it doesn't impact their relationship. The study improves our ability to estimate the local, regional and global impacts of future (and past) land use changes on the natural and built environments. If global change is to be managed for humankind's benefit, then control and knowledge of land use change will be paramount. Simulation of policy impacts via computer modeling and visualization, and using the forecasts within decision and planning support systems, are precious for creating a sustainable future.",Slovenia,14.995463,46.151241,1

Sociology",Sociology,Verta Taylor,"Social movement abeyance theorizes the persistence of social movements during times that are antagonistic to mobilization. In this dissertation, I argue that U.S. feminism is currently in abeyance and that educational institutions are generative environments for abeyance structures. Drawing on theories of women's movements, student movements, and movements inside institutions, I provide a systematic updating of abeyance theory. The study's design is comparative: the three field sites are Smith College, the University of Minnesota-Twin Cities and the University of California-Santa Barbara, which are not only in three different regions of the U.S. but also have diverse student demographics and activist cultures. I employ both qualitative and quantitative methods and include semi-structured interviews (n=75), participant observation, and a survey of college students on each campus (n=1,400). I highlight three variable dimensions that help us understand the unique nature of social movements in abeyance: fields of contention, collective identity, and tactical repertoires. I argue that during periods in which mobilized participants have little support: a) institutions of higher education provide welcome environments for feminist mobilization, often in unexpected locations such as multi-cultural sororities and student government; b) feminist collective identities nest or ""spill over"" to influence other social movements including queer, anti-racist, and anti-fee hike organizations; and c) tactics move on-line, especially to social networking sites.

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Phillip B. Gans,"The history of late Miocene (Proto-Gulf) deformation on the Sonoran margin of the Gulf of California is key to understanding how Baja California was captured by the Pacific plate and how strain was partitioned during the Proto-Gulf period (12.5-6 Ma). The Sierra el Aguaje and Sierra Tinajas del Carmen are located in southwestern coastal Sonora, Mexico, and represent the eastern rifted margin of the central Gulf of California. The ranges are composed of volcanic units and their corresponding volcaniclastic units which are the result of persistent magmatic activity between 20 and 8.8 Ma, including three packages of basalt and andesite that make excellent paleomagnetic recorders. Based on cross cutting relations and geochronologic data for pre-, syn-, and post-tectonic volcanic units, most of the faulting and tilting in the Sierra El Aguaje is bracketed between 11.9 and 9.0 Ma, thus falling entirely within Proto-Gulf time. A paleomagnetic investigation into possible vertical axis rotations in the Sierra el Aguaje has uncovered evidence of clockwise rotations between ~13 and ~105 with possible translations. These results are consistent with existing field relations, which suggest the presence of large (>45) vertical axis rotations in this region. This evidence includes: a) abrupt changes in the strike of tilted strata in different parts of the range, including large domains characterized by E-W strikes b) ubiquitous NE-SW striking faults with left lateral-normal oblique slip, that terminate against major NW-trending right lateral faults, and c) obliquity between the general strike of tilted strata and the strike of faults. These rotations occurred after 12 Ma and largely prior to 9 Ma, thus falling into the Proto-Gulf period. Such large-scale rotations lend credence to the theory that the area inboard of Baja California was experiencing transtension during the Proto-Gulf period, rather than the pure extension that would be the result of strain partitioning between Sonora and the Tosco-Abreojos fault offshore Baja California.","Sonora, Mexico",-110.3308814,29.2972247,1

Comparative Literature",Comparative Literature,"Carl Gutierrez Jones, George Lipsitz","A comparative study of the relation between the poetics and the politics of racial disavowal and antiracism across national borders and literary traditions, this dissertation examines the rhetorical contours of colorblindness and their implications for contemporary Afro-Panamanian, Black South African, and Chicana/o literatures, and for the production of knowledge. I consider colorblindness as an ideology and discourse, as well as a metaphor for the global attempt to invisibilize ""the colorline,---the relation of the darker races to the lighter races of men in Asia and Africa, in America and the islands of the sea"" that W.E.B. Du Bois in The Souls of Black Folk (1903) identified as the ""problem of the twentieth century."" While the colorline persists, colorblindness poses a crucial obstacle to its removal in the twenty-first century. While much contemporary racial theory posits the novelty of the current racial order and the hegemonic discourse that sustains it, this study examines overlaps and continuities between colonial, overt white supremacist, and colorblindness discourse, as well as unforeseen affinities between particular colonial and decolonial imaginaries. In the process, it uncovers the rhetorical manifestations of what I call an epistemology of disavowal, and shows that colorblindness is not a new discourse. I argue that maintaining the centrality of the conceptual category colonialism is itself necessary if we are to understand the rhetorical contours of colorblindness and their far-reaching implications in the twenty-first century. Just as the current racial order displays striking continuities with the colonial past, entanglement also defines colorblindness, a pan-white discourse whose reproduction, as this dissertation demonstrates, transcends historical, national, linguistic, literary, disciplinary, and racial boundaries. Anchored in colonial relations, the rhetorics and logics that structure colorblindness form part of the archive and repertoire of white knowledge, which I define as a discursive formation and literary tradition shaping, and shaped by, the white supremacist canon. I also conceptualize white knowledge as racial consciousness. Tracing colorblindness from the Americas to South Africa, the study concurrently illustrates the transportability of the discourse across time and space, its contextual and geographical particularity, and its inextricability from deeply entrenched colonial epistemologies and ontologies.",South Africa,22.937506,-30.559482,10

Computer Science",Computer Science,Elizabeth M. Belding,"In this work we focus on unique Internet connectivity challenges and opportunities in rural areas, especially in developing regions. Providing access in rural areas is particularly challenging due to its unique set of social and technical constraints. In order to quantify the challenges being faced by Internet users in rural areas, we conducted on-site and on-line interviews and analysed network traces from a rural network in Macha, Zambia. Our findings reveal severe local and global connectivity limitations that are unique to rural areas. Local wireless networks experience interference and packet loss due to poor network designs and limitations of WiFi in rural areas. Bandwidth-restricted Internet gateways are constantly congested during normal daytime usage periods. Users describe cost, limited availability and unreliability of Internet access as key barriers to on-line interaction. These obstacles prevent leisurely access to the Internet, including, amongst others, users generating and sharing media. This leads to a more transaction-like or ""deliberate interaction"" model for many rural users. Usage analysis reveals unique behaviour for users in rural areas. Most traffic is web-based traffic as opposed to peer-to-peer traffic in developed countries. Social media features even more prominently than in western countries, with Facebook being the most visited website; users are twice as likely to access Facebook than Google search. Further analysis of Facebook traffic shows a high degree of traffic between local users in the village. These unique patterns and constraints form the basis for ICT solutions we propose for rural regions. In order to avoid using congested rural Internet gateways, we propose a set of techniques to localize traffic. VillageShare, a Facebook-based localization application, facilitates file sharing amongst users in the village without the need to send media over the bandwidth-constrained gateway. VillageShare is also capable of time-shifting uploads to off-peak usage periods in order to avoid upload failures. In order to exploit locality of interest in mobile phone usage, we designed VillageCell, an open-source, low-cost pico-cell-like base station, that allows users to make free local cellular calls in a village. It takes advantage of the very high penetration rate of mobile phones in rural Africa, which occurs even though many villages lack cellular coverage. VillageCell is also able to support SMS to instant message client exchange as well as routing calls between VillageCell phones and phones on the public switched telephone network. The low population density and large village diameters in rural areas of Africa imply a need for novel solutions to spread wireless connectivity to individual homes. Current solutions, based on 802.11 require clear line-of-sight and have limited range. Those based on WiMax are not suitable due to high licence and deployment costs. We propose to use the recently freed TV spectrum bands known as ""white spaces"", encompassing frequencies from 52MHz to 698MHz, to cover vast distances in rural areas. Our solution, VillageLink, builds on the existing 802.22 white space standard to optimally utilize white space spectrum. We add a feature that allows base stations to allocate optimal channels using inter-cell probing across all available TV channels. Channel probing is critical as frequency selectivity is more dependent on antenna characteristics and non-linearity of RF components in the system than on the free-space propagation laws in the white space band. In order to evaluate our interventions, we deployed VillageShare and VillageCell in Macha, Zambia and evaluated VillageLink using simulations built on a real 3 km white space link in South Africa. We collected usage logs of these systems both through quantitative and qualitative studies. For qualitative studies we involved users in an iterative design process and made use of on-line interviews to understand user perception of our solutions. Ultimately, we hope that this research will lead to better penetration of wireless networks and improved network performance for users in rural villages, culminating in a more inclusive and representative Internet that truly reflects all languages and cultures in the world.

Feminist Studies",Feminist Studies,Leila Rupp,"Since its transition from apartheid in 1993, South Africa has presented itself as one of the most liberal and progressive democracies in the world. Even in 2014, as it celebrates 20 years of democracy, South Africa garners the attention of scholars, NGO activists, and political refugees---all of whom are captivated by the expanse of minority and human rights enshrined in its constitution. With such attention, Cape Town earns the proud moniker "" The Gay Capital of Africa""---whose vibrant nightlife makes it an (inter, trans)national epitome of ""LGBT"" equality. Such impulses are implicated in struggles over race and space that reveal persistent class divisions among black and coloured-identified gay men. I, therefore, commit my research to participants' significant and agentic strategies to achieve visibility and participate in ""The Gay Capital of Africa""---through which they upset the terms of effort and construct more capacious ways of being a gay man. Drawing from Michel Foucault, Jasbir Puar, Jose Munoz, and Roland Barthes' notion of ""Vestimentary Systems,"" I conclude that clothing is a performance of post-apartheid modernity and strategy for surviving persistent structural constraints in Cape Town. I ask: what are the terms of such equality? How do gay men seek, acquire, and maintain visibility in Capetonian nightlife? What does such visibility mean, and what does the South African state gain from its documentation in LGBT tourism media? Through participant observation and interviews, I explore what admission standards at nightlife venues in De Waterkant---Cape Town's ""Gay Village---say about being a (post-apartheid) gay man. Juxtaposing gay nightlife with a post-apartheid democracy, I show how nightclubs are regulatory institutions that produce subjects whose clothed bodies signify gay and racial equality.

Global and International Studies",Global and International Studies,Eve Darian-Smith,"This study is the result of two months of fieldwork conducted in the Maboneng Precinct; interviews were conducted with Propertuity staff, including Jonathan Liebmann (CEO of Propertuity Development), Alice Cabaret, the firm's urban strategist, as well as inner city residents, businesses, and South African nongovernmental organizations. This study ultimately aims to expose the under-discussed, central aspects of the neighborhood's design that act to reinforce class divisions and contribute to the displacement and marginalization of low-income residents throughout Johannesburg. The Maboneng Precinct, a regenerating neighborhood on the eastern side of the central business district (CBD), is rapidly transforming the inner city into a home for the city's elite and well-to-do youth. The Maboneng Precinct has successfully branded itself as an inclusive and integrated alternative to the exclusive northern suburbs, thereby allowing the neighborhood to successfully distance itself from accusations of gentrifying the inner city and displacing low-income residents. But despite a well-developed narrative of inclusivity, Maboneng is actively engaged in gentrifying urban space: the neighborhood functions as a fortified enclave within the inner city, where it caters exclusively to middle- and upper-income people seeking to ""take back the city"" from the urban poor. These actions erode the rights of ordinary individuals to inhabit, appropriate, and move within urban space. Dreams of a fully integrated and equitable South Africa have not been realized in the twenty years since the fall of apartheid. Inequality, spatial segregation, and economic and social exclusion within the country now highlight the limitations of the new democratic government and the incompleteness of South Africa's formal racial desegregation. These forces are articulated across Johannesburg's urban landscape, where: (1) wealth is concentrated in the northern suburbs, (2) peripheral townships continue to suffer from inadequate access to housing, service provision, and a lack of economic opportunity, and (3) inner city Johannesburg is dominated by the competing forces of urban degeneration and gentrification; interest in regenerating and reclaiming the inner city for wealthy suburbanites has grown in the last fifteen years, and now threatens to displace the inner city's low-income population.",South Africa,22.937506,-30.559482,10

History",History,"Erika D. Rappaport, Stephan F. Miescher","This dissertation traces the evolution of immigration policy and practice in South Africa and Rhodesia/Zimbabwe from the Second World War to the 1970s. It outlines the importance of wartime experience in explaining the surge in post-war migration to southern Africa. It then traces the role of migration in the attempt to reinvent empire as Commonwealth in the decades after the Second World War as the British government encouraged migration to the Dominions and Southern Rhodesia despite a labor shortage. Using debates surrounding immigration, it highlights the tensions in South Africa and Southern Rhodesia as minority settler colonial regimes between gaining more white population and ensuring racial prestige in the 1940s and 1950s.Though always determined by race, by the 1960s, selective policies based on nationality and class gave way to more aggressive recruitment of immigrants defined by these states as white as a demographic defense of minority rule in a rapidly decolonizing continent. Though such efforts bore limited results in war torn Rhodesia, South Africa saw a dramatic increase of European and particularly British migration from the 1960s to the early 1980s. Alongside this political and demographic study, it uses migrant oral histories, biographies and letters to reveal the ongoing personal and familial ties between these nations and Britain, and the persistence of imperial migration networks even after the collapse of formal empire. Challenging the characterization of South African republic in 1961 and the Rhodesian Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965 as sharp breaks with the United Kingdom, this dissertation adds to a growing literature complicating the chronology of decolonization.",South Africa,22.937506,-30.559482,10

Sociology",Sociology,France Winddance Twine,"More than twenty years after the dismantling of South Africa's white supremacist apartheid regime, racial inequalities remain entrenched in the South African landscape. Blacks are still largely excluded from white spaces and denied the resources and opportunities historically hoarded by whites. Despite their socially marginalized positions, Black South African women in the peri-urban townships have successfully established home-based bed and breakfasts for tourists in the post-apartheid era. In entering the global tourism market, some of these entrepreneurial Black women have developed social and economic relationships with white South African and European women. This thesis examines these transracial and transnational partnerships in the South African township bed and breakfast market. Drawing from field research and interviews conducted in Khayelitsha, a township outside of Cape Town, I demonstrate how these connections facilitate Black women's small business establishment and growth. Moreover, I argue that these unique relationships challenge the systemic processes that reproduce racial inequality, rendering township bed and breakfasts small but important sites where these processes are disrupted.",South Africa,22.937506,-30.559482,10

Known as the ""Globe to Globe"" series, this set of productions received ambivalent and sometimes condescending reviews from British critics who did not understand the translation languages or performance conventions. Taking these reviews to encapsulate the productions' reception, scholars have agreed that the series reinforced hegemonic hierarchies between spectators and performers. They argue that the displacement to London rendered the performances' original meanings unintelligible; further, that this dislocation stimulated national superiority in British spectators who measured the performances against their expectations of Shakespeare and their tourist-like desires to witness an exotic Other. However, this perspective obscures both the agency of the performers as participants in the encounter and the diversity of audience response, presenting a fatalistic view of touring performance. I argue that that in a performance across language and culture, failures in understanding do not indicate the failure of the event; rather, they can provoke spectators to suspend their preconceptions and negotiate new relationships. Reading professional reviews against the grain and placing them in conversation with video records and other documentation of the mass audiences' reactions, I suggest that the productions subverted the tourist gaze by resisting easy comprehension. As translation and 'foreign' performance conventions reshaped famous texts, the productions undermined audiences' expectations of both Shakespeare and the culture onstage. Confronted with the limits of their knowledge, spectators improvised new strategies of viewing, learning habits of listening and questioning that challenged cultural hierarchies. These events further undermined dominant power dynamics by attracting audiences from London's diasporic communities and privileging their knowledge and reactions over those of the normative British spectator. This trend intensified in 2012, when the Globe to Globe concept was revived as a massive festival for audiences containing many translation-language speakers.

Religious Studies",Religious Studies,Vesna A. Wallace,"This dissertation investigates the ways in which the literary tools of autobiography are used to describe religious experience in pre-colonial South Asia. Arguing against a Western scholarly tradition that presents autobiography as a narrowly-defined genre produced primarily in the West and its colonial outposts, this project gathers and compares examples from a wide range of regional, linguistic, religious, and historical contexts in order to better understand what characteristics distinguish---and unite---these autobiographical expressions. We will also take three case studies---one Jain, one Sikh, and one Hindu---to illustrate some of the myriad ways in which South Asian religious autobiography functions. This is an important and timely contribution to the study of South Asian religions and the humanities in general for three reasons. First, our analyses illustrate the multiplicity of ways in which autobiography can convey religious meaning and are used to make specific kinds of religious claims. Second, we put Western literary criticism in conversation with South Asian sources in new and productive ways, particularly regarding issues of authorship, genre, and poetic technique. Finally, our data helps to dispel the notion that autobiography---and by extension, individual subjectivity---was a colonial import to South Asia. This project will begin with a discussion of autobiography as genre and technique, and a consideration of how that genre/technique is particularly suited to describing religious experience. Our second chapter examines a number of examples of religious autobiographical writing from pre-colonial South Asia in order to begin to form a picture of what autobiographical literature looks like in pre-colonial South Asia. Our third chapter is a case study of the Ardhakathanaka, the autobiography of 17 th-century Jain merchant Banarasidas, considering its uses of autobiography as literary technique and as polemic. Finally, we study two examples of what we will call the ""autobiographical pose"": works that are not, in fact, autobiographies at all, but that use the autobiographical voice. The cases for this chapter will be poems attributed to the 16th-century Hindu poet-saint Mirabai, and the 18th-century "" apni Katha,"" a work attributed to Guru Gobind Singh, the tenth and last personal Guru of the Sikhs.",South Asia,76.4563087,25.03764,1

Drawing from cultural representations and interviews I conducted with fifty-one women in rural South Dakota and Minnesota, I suggest that an estrangement exists between the desires, logics, and strategies of LGBTQ women in the rural Midwest and those of gay rights movements. This estrangement points to the need to consider the ideologies undergirding and the ramifications of LGBTQ visibility politics. I make three interventions in the interdisciplinary study of visibility: I argue that calls for visibility are symptomatic of and enable metronormativity, that visibility politics reproduce both post-racial and what I term post-spatial ideologies, and, finally, that becoming recognizable as visible is a labored process, and, as such, calls for LGBTQ visibility, which relentlessly demand constant laboring, are a reflection of and benefit to capitalist logics. In doing so, I revise assumptions about the ostensible relations among gay community, identity, and visibility, question the notion that visibility leads to rights or justice, and challenge dominant conceptions of the nature of rural communities. Beyond examining the unbecoming-ness of visibility discourses, I suggest that an interrogation of visibility discourses explicates how one becomes (and might un-become) a sexual subject and can broaden possibilities for actualizing alternate subjectivities--sexual or otherwise.",South Dakota,-99.9018131,43.9695148,1

It indicates that social media data has a rigorous potential and can be a new source for an EWS. This new approach method with social media data can be applied to other closed countries. After the Korean War in 1950, the Korean Peninsula was divided into North and South Korea. From that time on, a hostile stand-off has persisted for more than 60 years. After Kim Jong-un come to power, North Korea's provocations, such as the Yeon-Pyong Island bombardment and the attack of a Chen-an South Korean navy ship, reached a new level. North Korea is still threatening international societies by developing Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMD) such as nuclear weapons and Intercontinental Ballistic Missiles. Moreover, as we saw from the 'Sony hack incident' where Sony Pictures Entertainment was hacked by North Korea in 2014 because of the film 'The Interview,' North Korea is now concentrating on cyber warfare. Thus, because of these incidents, the need for an advanced Early Warning System (EWS) against North Korea is increasing. For the tag analysis of Flickr and Twitter, all tags were counted and high-frequency tags were extracted and visualized with Word Cloud techniques. Lastly, various maps were generated using several visualization techniques. Second, 12,394 tweets from all over the world during the 'Sony hack incident' were analyzed for a case study. Study findings revealed that Twitter data provides a real time reflection of user's interest, event, place and time. Although North Koreans cannot use the Internet or social media applications, there were 11 tweets from North Korea and all of the locations for tweets were identified by Google Earth. By doing so, the potential flaws in using social media data, such as IP address hacking, were found. This thesis demonstrates the potential of social media data as a new source to collect Geo-spatial Intelligence (GeoINT) for an advanced EWS. In this thesis, structural analysis, based on geospatial data and content analysis utilizing images and text tags were conducted using two different datasets, Flickr and Twitter. First, a new approach for geotagged image processing was designed using the K-means and Spectral clustering algorithm using 3,981 North Korea Flickr images over a period of 11 years. Principal Components Analysis (PCA) demonstrated that image entropy is an effective input parameter for image characterization. We concluded that the Spectral clustering algorithm is suitable for selecting outlier images. In addition, Centrographic statistics were applied for the analysis of spatial and temporal dynamics. As a result, geotagged social media data revealed their user's behavior and interest by time and space.",South Korea,127.766922,35.907757,2

Political Science",Political Science,Benjamin J. Cohen,"This dissertation examines the negotiation processes of financial and monetary cooperation in East Asia since the 1997--1998 Asian financial crisis, which have been understudied. The purpose of this study is to explore the various strategies and tactics that helped to shape particular agreement details, in order to provide more insight to our understanding of the dynamics of international economic negotiations. Since the conventional three levels of analysis of International Relations cannot tell which specific outcome may be selected, a problem of multiple equilibria results. I contend that negotiators' bargaining strategies and tactics can solve a multiple equilibria problem as they help explain the specific details of outcomes. This research uses the recent agreement to multilateralize the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMIM), with particular emphasis on the issues of members' financial contributions and vote shares, to analyze negotiation processes. Due to data inaccessibility problems and financial constraints, I chose to focus on five of the most influential players in the CMIM negotiations---Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. It should be noted that China, though it was an important actor in the CMIM negotiations, is not included in my analysis due to a lack of direct access to Chinese sources. Extensive archival research and in-depth interviews were employed to collect data. Process tracing was a method of analysis. My investigation of the CMIM negotiations reveals that the member states employed several bargaining elements to alter final outcome. States with a lower discount rate (a lower sense of urgency) and a more attractive best alternative to no agreement (batna) were able to walk away with more favorable terms than those with a higher discount rate and less attractive batna. Also, possessing knowledge about other actors' preferences or about issues being discussed (expertise) enhanced states' relative bargaining leverage. Countries took advantage of being a co-chair of the negotiation to turn the agreement terms in their favor. In some circumstances, countries strategically linked issues under negotiation to reap concessions from the others. Additionally, forming a coalition or preventing a coalition of other states from forming sometimes helped states achieve their objectives.",South Korea,127.766922,35.907757,2

Geography",Geography,Michael F. Goodchild,"Guinea worm (Dracunculiasis) is a two-host, nematode parasite that is currently the focus of an international eradication effort. The remaining few of these parasites live in sub-Saharan and Sahelian Africa in the countries of Chad, Ethiopia, Mali, and South Sudan. By the end of 2010 there were fewer than 1,800 cases of Guinea worm reported worldwide, an astonishing decrease from the estimated 3.5 million reported cases in 1980 when the international eradication effort began. There is no vaccine or preventative medicine to inoculate against the parasite and the eradication effort has focused on an educational program, teaching those at risk how to prevent infection. Through education and community programs to improve access to clean and safe drinking water, it is hoped that the parasite will have been eliminated from the waters worldwide in the near future. The goal of this research is to understand how Guinea worm has reemerged in regions where it had once been eliminated. A current hurdle to the eradication effort is to supervise the regions where Guinea worm once existed to ensure there is no reemergence. There have been several incidents of reemergence in the past and the work for this dissertation examines historical data on Guinea worm reemergence to better understand the process and identify the most suitable methods for locating regions at risk for reemergence. Results of this analysis show that specific transportation networks and medical facilities may play a role in determining the spread of Guinea worm as it reestablishes itself in a region. This work reiterates that both disease transmission and species abundance are fundamentally spatial processes and that the incorporation of spatial approaches provides new insights into the nature of Guinea worm reemergence.

Chicana and Chicano Studies",Chicana and Chicano Studies,"Mario T. Garcia, George Lipsitz","This dissertation documents, describes, and analyzes the emergence and elaboration of cultural expressions produced by the comedy troupe Chicano Secret Service (CSS) from 1988 to the present. As part of the Chicana/o Radical Performance Tradition, the performances of CSS imagined and created a culture of liberation and emancipation through Chicana/o political satire. The sketch comedy troupe's response to the neoliberal racial capitalist moment of the late 1980s to the present articulated what I describe as ""Oppositional Performance."" This dissertation argues that instances of opposition performance emanate from within the contested historical context between the dominant neoliberal bloc and the emergent Chicana/o art performance bloc. Utilizing the interdisciplinary research methods of Chicana/o Cultural Studies and incorporating performance studies, media studies, history, and sociology, this dissertation interrogates the socio-historical significance of Chicano Secret Service and Chicana/o cultural production. This dissertation also serves as a CSS archive. Interviews were conducted with all the members of CSS: Elias Serna, Susan Carrasco, Eduardo Lopez. As a scholar/activist/ and member of CSS I have utilized an observant participant method to conduct a critical oral history of CSS. I also conducted interviews with people that played a large role in assisting CSS to become an avant-garde comedy troupe, such as Luis Valdez, Rene Yanez, Tiffany Ann Lopez, Kinan Valdez, Laura Perez and Diane Gamboa. I also collected and analyzed CSS films and performance videos, along with a collection of newspaper articles, unpublished scripts, posters, performance programs and original story boards. My cultural-historical analysis links the practices of CSS to the Chicana/o power movement renaissance art movement and to the Chicana/o avant-garde. Grounded in this Chicana/o Radical Performance Tradition, CSS expresses the collective response of the Chicana/o working classes in Southern California in a neoliberal historical context. I analyze four landmark actos/sketches and three multimedia performances to demonstrate how Chicana/o expressive cultures can subvert hegemony in ephemeral yet unpredictably enduring terms. The oppositional performances produced by CSS resonate within the Chicana/o Radical Performance Tradition that simultaneously critiques cultural domination and turns hegemony on its head. Drawing on oppositional performances and the Chicana/o Radical Performance Tradition as a framework, I argue that Chicano Secret Service's work exhibits the tenets expressed within the Radical Chicana/o Tradition in a more general manner. Although such performances illuminate the life world of the individuals within CSS, the collaborative relations between different bodies, memories, and communities within enacted performance spaces intertwine to produce a collective Chicana/o performance and social power. This dissertation argues that such performances are mestizo rhetorics, new inventions of Western and indigenous cultures that create forms of Chicana/o knowledge.",Southern California,-116.419389,34.9592083,2

Linguistics",Linguistics,Mary Bucholtz,"The underrepresentation of women in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM) fields is well-documented and enduring (Huang et al. 2000; National Science Foundation 2004, 2011), particularly in fields that require extensive mathematical training (Ceci & Williams 2010). Attempts to identify the source of the gender gap have indicated that causes range from interactional (Bergvall & Remlinger 1996) to institutional (Moss-Racusin 2012). Some research has suggested that the perception of STEM fields as ""unfeminine"" reduces young girls' interest in them. This idea positions expert STEM identities as at odds and incompatible with feminine identities (Thomas-Hunt & Philips 2004). Using data from a large ethnographic study on the cultural and linguistic practices of high-achieving math and science undergraduates at a public university in Southern California, this thesis argues that mathematical expertise can indeed be enacted along with a range of feminine personae. Focusing on three female students who regularly show expertise in their small peer groups in a multivariable calculus course, I argue that each woman enacts expertise while performing different gendered styles. One student claims a more traditional nerd girl identity, eschewing slang and traditional forms of feminine material self-presentation and using a formal mathematical register and unmarked intonation. The second student, while often forceful that she is right, employs a marked nasal whiny intonation when contesting the teaching assistant's decisions and advice, constructing a kind of childlike cute femininity. The third student enacts expertise within her otherwise all-male peer group, and physically presents herself as more emblematic of youthful, middle-class femininity while employin non-interrogative rising intonation, a practice often ideologically seen as feminine. This study shows that a range of feminine styles is not incompatible with expert STEM identities. This research implies that for STEM educators concerned with gender equity, by recognizing that expertise can be accompanied by any kind of gendered persona, women should be encouraged to explore career paths in STEM fields without feeling that they need to conform to a certain type of feminine style.",Southern California,-116.419389,34.9592083,2

In that of Francisco Ayala, it identifies in the elaboration of a relationship between literary text and meaning distinct from than that between sign and referent a mechanism for transforming the interpretative effort to determine the true meaning of the text from one that suppresses difference and multiplicity to one that motivates empathy. Finally, in philosopher Maria Zambrano's signature concept of razon poetica, or poetic reason, it finds a means of locating an emancipatory social politics within a history structured by inclusion, rather than exclusion.

Geography",Geography,"John Weeks, David Lopez-Carr","The characteristics of places where people live and work play an important role in explaining complex social, political, economic and demographic processes. In sub-Saharan Africa rapid urban growth combined with rising poverty is creating diverse urban environments inhabited by people with a wide variety of lifestyles. This research examines how spatial patterns of land cover in a southern portion of the West African country of Ghana are associated with particular characteristics of family organization and reproduction decisions. Satellite imagery and landscape metrics are used to create an urban context definition based on landscape patterns using a gradient approach. Census data are used to estimate fertility levels and household structure, and the association between urban context, household composition and fertility levels is modeled through OLS regression, spatial autoregressive models and geographically weighted regression. Results indicate that there are significant differences in fertility levels between different urban contexts, with below average fertility levels found in the most urbanized end of the urban context definition and above average fertility levels found on the opposite end. The spatial patterns identified in the association between urban context and fertility levels indicate that, within the city areas with lower fertility have significant impacts on the reproductive levels of adjacent neighborhoods. Findings also indicate that there are clear patterns that link urban context to living arrangements and fertility levels. Female- and single-headed households are associated with below average fertility levels, a result that connects dropping fertility levels with the spread of smaller nuclear households in developing countries. At the same time, larger extended family households are linked to below average fertility levels for highly clustered areas, a finding that points to the prevalence of extended family housing in the West African city.",Spain,-3.74922,40.463667,9

Luisa de Gusmao: Gender and Power in Seventeenth Century Portugal,2012,"Vallance, Monique M.","University of California, Santa Barbara. History",History,Francis A. Dutra,"This thesis explores the relationship between gender norms and political power in seventeenth century Portugal through the regency of Queen D. Luisa de Gusmao (1656-1662). It discusses D. Luisa's use of the proscribed gender roles of the seventeenth century in order to gain political stability at court, which enabled her to conduct diplomatic relations with other European powers. Her actions are analyzed and compared against the accepted gender roles of the time to show that she manipulated the men around her by over-emphasizing the female stereotype, leading them to believe that she was behaving in manners that were expected of her as a queen regent and mother. Instead, she used this as a cover to achieve her own agenda and fix some of the mistakes made by her late husband, D. Joao IV. The end result was a victory in their war against Spain, and the continuance of Portuguese independence after a brief Iberian Union (1580-1640). This fits one more piece into the puzzle of women's history, especially in relation to the power of the queen regent. It also adds to the scholarship of this period, one that has until recently been mostly neglected by Portuguese historians.",Spain,-3.74922,40.463667,9

History",History,Sarah Cline,"Portuguese merchant families migrated to New Spain (colonial Mexico) in the early 1600s when the crowns of Spain and Portugal were united from 1580 to 1640. At the beginning of the 1640s, immediately after Portugal successfully rebelled and gained independence from Spain, the Holy Office of the Inquisition in Mexico began to arrest and try en-mass a group of these now wealthy Portuguese merchants living in Mexico whom it suspected of secretly practicing Judaism. By 1642 there were 200 individuals being tried, most of them languishing in the secret prisons of the tribunal. Over the course of the 1640s the secret trials continued and culminated in a final public Gran auto de fe (act of faith) on April 11, 1649, in which the sentences of the accused were announced. In the most egregious cases secular authorities executed the convicted. This dissertation examines the lives of three of these crypto-Jewish families. The dissertation first considers the institutional history of the Holy Office of the Inquisition in colonial Mexico from its founding in 1571 to the 1640s. It examines the procedures and personalities of the tribunal throughout these trials based on correspondence between the tribunal and its superior court in Madrid Spain, the Suprema. The dissertation presents detailed case studies of three family clusters, the Enriquez Mendez and the Leon Jaramillo, both of which immigrated originally from Portugal, to Spain and then to colonial Mexico. The third cluster is a smaller family led by a single mother, Ana Enriquez, who along with her daughter Isabel immigrated from Spain to colonial Mexico and became part of the merchant elite described above. All members of these three families were tried during this period, but had very different circumstances. In all three families, however, there was a generational divide between the generation of those who emigrated and continued to faithfully practice their Judaism, and the next generation of their children, who did not practice Judaism as readily. Furthermore, those children identified more closely with the multi-ethnic setting and the Hispanic Christianity they found in colonial Mexico. The sources about these families consisted of archival material, especially the Inquisition trials in which the witness depositions of the accused and of other witnesses describe not only the religion of these families, but their day-to-day lives as well. I have used archival material from Inquisition, financial, and other legal records found at archives in The United States, Spain, and Mexico.",Spain,-3.74922,40.463667,9

Latin American and Iberian Studies",Latin American and Iberian Studies,Francis A. Dutra,"This thesis traces the construction of popular images of the veiled female figure in Spain and Peru, through the eyes of male artists and writers. I focus on the creation of two distinct archetypes of veiled women, the Morisca in sixteenth-century Spain and the Tapada in nineteenth-century Peru, and how these male-constructed identities increasingly reinforced notions of sexuality and eroticism of the forbidden in the popular imagination. I examine how these distinct identities centered on very different uses of the veil, and how the women's perceived sense of agency through manipulation of the garment created ambivalent elements of desire and anxiety, contributing to male fascination with their images, while also cementing preconceived notions of the veiled female ""Other"" in the European imagination. By analyzing costume books, travel narratives, paintings, and photographs of these types, I demonstrate how the veil not only shaped the artists' perceptions of these women, but also how the viewer, or consumer of the artists' works understood these types in a much broader context, allowing the exaggerated characterizations of these women to represent entire populations and nations as the exotic Other. The veil became an interchangeable symbol of femininity and modesty, and, for some women, an emblem of freedom from surveillance in a highly patriarchal world. The varying degree that women used the veil to obscure their faces (in whole or in part) would lead to scandal and official censure, as well as a great deal of attention from male artists and writers. The men who drew, painted, and wrote about veiled women increasingly altered and shaped their images, an evolution I identify in the shifting textual and pictorial representations of the veil itself. The fantasy (or fear) of what lies beneath the veil prompted many male artists to expose the faces of their veiled subjects, if only on the surface of their canvases or the pages of their travel journals. All of these elements of exoticism derived from the presence of the veil, the element that would lead to the construction of the recognizable archetypes of the Spanish Morisca and the Peruvian Tapada.",Spain,-3.74922,40.463667,9

The document begins with historical information on the music, discussing its specific genres, tablature, and origins. Further, three composers, Luis Milan (1500-1561), Luys de Narvaez (fl. 1526-1549), and Alonso Mudarra (1508-1580), are discussed in detail. This study examines and offers insight into their lives and musical style. Eventually, my work in this area will expand to include the seven major vihuela composers. In later chapters, issues of performance practice are discussed, such as ornamentation, voice type, diction of early Spanish, and choice of instrument. Because so little has been written about this music in comparison to other genres of accompanied solo song, research posed no small challenge. The writings of John Ward and John Griffiths have been especially helpful. Both of these scholars have devoted their lives to this music and remain among the most respected experSts in the field. Their writings extensively informed this study. A unique part of our investigation is a section on the guitarist-singer collaboration. While there are many books dedicated to the pianist-singer collaboration, none familiar to me have been written on the collaboration between guitarist and singer. My own expertise as a performer served as the chief source of information. This section guides people in making the collaboration as effective as possible.

Spanish and Portuguese",Spanish and Portuguese,Sara Poot-Herrera,"The fundamental importance of the examination of these African nuns' lives lies not only in the revelation of the discourse strategies their writers used to avoid, emphasize or modify the color of the nuns' skin, but also in the analysis of the unusual phenomenon represented by the characters who surrounded the nuns, permitting Sister Juana Esperanza and Sister Teresa Juliana entry to cloistered institutions and, thereby, aiding them to become the subject of documentation in spite of their race. The basic bibliography for this investigation are the texts of Jose Gomez de la Parra and Juan Carlos Pan y Agua, written during the 18 th century and relating to significant events in the religious orders to which they belonged. The chronicle of the Carmelite convent Fundacion, y primero siglo del muy religioso convento del senor San Jose de religiosas carmelitas descalzas, in which is found the ""life"" of Sister Juana Esperanza de San Alberto, was written by Jose Gomez de la Parra in 1732 in honor of the centennial of the establishment of the Carmelite order in Puebla. Juan Carlos Pan y Agua wrote the Compendio de la vida ejemplar de Sor Teresa Juliana de Santo Domingo in 1752, basing the exemplary life on the funeral sermon he had delivered for the Dominican nun. Contemplating a model of female religiosity in the realms of Spain and New Spain in the late 17th to early 18th centuries could return us to an archetypical Marianite representation, whose image of purity and perfection is traditionally white, possibly brown, but rarely black. What happens when this construction of sanctity is based on something extraordinary and inserted in its deep-rooted orthodoxy? What happens when the destiny of two marginalized women, in this case two African slaves who took religious orders on either side of the Atlantic, becomes the object of exemplary religious discourse? This investigation presents the exemplary lives (vidas ejemplares) of Sister Juana Esperanza de San Alberto and Sister Teresa Juliana de Santo Domingo that, in spite of their appearance and condition, ceased to be slaves and became instead models of virtue. In addition to containing the vidas ejemplares of these African nuns, the richness of the texts themselves as well as the circumstances in which they were produced, give these writings an importance of their own. Compilations of the vidas ejemplares and the confessional autobiographies of the Carmelite nuns of Puebla are found in the chronicle of Gomez de la Parra. Pan y Aguas' compendium, based on the funeral speech of Teresa Juliana and written by the same author, contains discourse conventions which raise it above its genre and approach that of hagiography.",Spain,-3.74922,40.463667,9

Marine Science",Marine Science,Gretchen Hofmann,"Ocean acidification (OA) is expected to have a major effect on the marine carbonate system and predicting the response of marine ecosystems is a central objective for management and protection of marine communities. While many experimental studies have explored the impact of OA on the physiological performance of marine calcifiers by using future predicted atmospheric CO2 levels to parameterize laboratory experiments, less appreciated is the natural environmental variation within these systems, particularly in terms of pH. This natural variation may inform laboratory experiments and improve our ability to predict responses to a changing ocean climate. The central objective of this dissertation is to use an interdisciplinary approach to examine how marine larvae living in coastal regions may be impacted by future ocean acidification. This is accomplished using two distinct approaches: (1) organismal-level culturing experiments to test the thresholds of physiological response in larvae to altered seawater chemistry and (2) oceanographic observations of pH variation and water mass properties to identify ecosystem-specific patterns of natural variation. Biochemical, morphometric, and gene expression-based tools were used to examine how early life history stages of two sea urchins (Strongylocentrotus purpuratus and S. droebachiensis) respond to elevated pCO2 conditions. These results suggest that developing larvae may either prioritize endogenous energy towards development and physiological function at the expense of growth, or that reduced larval length may be strictly due to higher costs of growth under OA conditions. In addition, the magnitude of physiological responses, as quantified by gene expression, may be influenced by the parental adult habitat. Recent advances in pH sensor technology allowed our first glimpses at high-frequency pH variation in nearshore ecosystems and the ability to identify potential drivers of natural variation. Mooring-based observations in McMurdo Sound indicate that this ecosystem experiences low levels of diel pH variation (< 0.1 units) during austral Spring. Relatively greater pH variation was observed at shallow coastal sites as opposed to those in deeper water. This variation is likely not driven by water mass mixing, but may be due to photosynthesis by under ice algae in shallow coastal sites.",Spring,-116.4221597,36.4217009,1

Political Science",Political Science,Cynthia Kaplan,"The formation of the European Union creates a political condition that requires political to parties consider two levels of political competition: domestic politics and EU-level politics. For most parties EU-level politics are a secondary concern for political parties. As a result, EU policies have received little attention in domestic political competition. However, with deepening European integration, EU-level politics have emerged as a potential issue in domestic political competition. As part of their efforts to win votes and seats, parties must decide whether to develop a position on EU-level politics, or to remain focused on their domestic political platform. While the salience of EU-level politics is low across most European states, its importance does vary from country to country. This dissertation project attempts to answer several questions concerning the relationship between EU-level politics and domestic political competition. First, how do debates about the European Union manifest in domestic politics? Second, how does nationalism influence how EU policies are discussed in domestic politics? In order to explore these questions this dissertation expands on our understanding of how fringe parties use nationalism to influence the salience of EU-level policies in domestic political competition. It argues that differences in nationalism influence the types of EU policies that fringe, anti-EU parties can argue as a threat to the national group in a way to increase their votes. In turn, the efforts of these fringe parties influence what EU policies become salient in domestic political competition and also influence the attitudes of political parties toward EU polices. In order to develop this argument this dissertation first develops a method for determining types of nationalism for EU states ranging from inclusionary civic nationalism to exclusionary ethnic nationalism. It then argues that considering the EU as multiple issue areas as opposed to a single issue allows for a stronger understanding of party positions toward EU-level policies. In order to determine the salience of EU policies for political parties as well as their attitudes toward those policies this project moves beyond party manifesto data by collecting party statements posted on official party webpages in campaign period before the 2014 European Parliamentary elections for parties in Sweden, Germany, Estonia, and Poland. It then codes the documents for any statements concerning EU political, economic, or social policies. The dissertation then uses a descriptive and statistical analysis at both the state-level and party-level of analysis in order to test the influence that different types of national have on variation in the salience of EU-level policies across Europe. The results demonstrate that nationalism does influence the discussion of EU-level politics in domestic political competition. They also support evidence that there is party cohesion among parties in European party families concerning party attitudes toward EU political, economic, and social policies.",Sweden,18.643501,60.128161,3

Political Science",Political Science,Cynthia Kaplan,"The formation of the European Union creates a political condition that requires political to parties consider two levels of political competition: domestic politics and EU-level politics. For most parties EU-level politics are a secondary concern for political parties. As a result, EU policies have received little attention in domestic political competition. However, with deepening European integration, EU-level politics have emerged as a potential issue in domestic political competition. As part of their efforts to win votes and seats, parties must decide whether to develop a position on EU-level politics, or to remain focused on their domestic political platform. While the salience of EU-level politics is low across most European states, its importance does vary from country to country. This dissertation project attempts to answer several questions concerning the relationship between EU-level politics and domestic political competition. First, how do debates about the European Union manifest in domestic politics? Second, how does nationalism influence how EU policies are discussed in domestic politics? In order to explore these questions this dissertation expands on our understanding of how fringe parties use nationalism to influence the salience of EU-level policies in domestic political competition.

Sociology",Sociology,John W. Mohr,"This study is an ethnography of the global. The Forum: A response to Paradigm Shift From State to Global Governance Field is based on what I perceive as an emerging pattern in global governance that is qualitatively different than past realities. The difference is signaled by what I perceive as an evolution of Pierre Bourdieu's theories on the state. Bourdieu's notion of the state field can be extended to the study of a global governance field wherein spheres of the state field have evolved together but at different rates and, at times, with differing objectives. These spheres include traditional governing institutions, the global economic sector, and global civil society. Traditional governance and the global economic sector were the first to begin their evolution from the level of the state to the global. Global civil society has emerged as a third actor within that field of global governance and has begun to act as mediator, and mitigator when needed, to the other actors. The World Economic Forum is one such actor, and one that has gained significant influence within the field of global governance. In 1971 the Forum began with a vision dedicated to bringing a more cooperative model to business based on the idea of multi-stakeholder environments. By the late 1990s and early 2000s, the Forum had established itself as a leading convener of the world's elite. Bringing together top CEOs from some of the world's most influential corporations with government and social leaders from across the globe, the Forum offered a space for these individuals to converge and discuss the necessary mutuality of their operations within shrinking global space. Controversial for many reasons, the Forum has still risen as convener, broker, knowledge producer and thereby policy generator for these global elite populations. This dissertation derives the majority of its data from an ethnographic study at their headquarter operations in Geneva, Switzerland. Based on 36 interviews with respondents ranging from a college intern to that of the founder and Chairman, as well as participant observation, and internal document analysis, this study seeks to understand how the Forum has evolved its internal culture from its inception and how this evolution has aided in organizational adaption trajectories that keep Forum services relevant to the global community that they serve. This study highlights why we should care about the Forum as an organization in the era of the global.",Switzerland,8.2275,46.8182,1

Global and International Studies",Global and International Studies,Paul Amar,"This paper looks at small arms transfers to non-state actors in the Syrian conflict as an under analyzed aspect of intervention in intrastate war that is both globalized and potentially destabilizing. I challenge the dominant narrative that the international community has failed to intervene in Syria, by pointing to the manifold government-funded arms transfers to opposition groups beginning in 2012. I find that there are two significant networks of arms trafficking: one through Jordan with Saudi Arabian and American support; the other through Turkey with Qatari support. These patterns and rivalries between donor countries have contributed to three processes within the transformation from revolution to civil war: militarization, increased sectarianism, and fragmentation of the opposition. I review two mechanisms of international arms control: multilateral embargoes and the recent Arms Trade Treaty. Their weaknesses, as evident in the case of Syria, are related to the problems of self-monitoring and enforcement by states that have contradictory incentives. Next, I address the related issue of surplus arms by looking at how the failure of disarmament measures in Iraq and Libya had a direct impact on arms proliferation in Syria. I conclude with a discussion of the legality of arms transfers to non-state actors and the need to focus on political rather than military solutions to globalized conflict.",Syria,38.996815,34.802075,1

Through an application of Michel Foucault's methodologies of genealogy and ethics, the current work seeks to understand both how and why practitioners submit themselves to and carry out the program of ethical development as taught by Li, as well as how they understand their practice and beliefs to relate to, continue and transform other such practices and beliefs throughout the longer history of religions in China, most notable among these Buddhism, Daoism and Confucianism. My study is concerned both with ethics in Michel Foucault's sense of 'morality', which he defines as ""the real behavior of individuals in relation to the rules and values that are recommended to them,"" as well as with the 'ethical work' of Falun Gong that, to again quote Foucault, ""one performs on oneself, not only in order to bring one's conduct into compliance with a given rule, but to attempt to transform oneself into the ethical subject of one's behavior."". What is discovered is that 'good' and 'evil' in the forms of de and karma are understood in Falun Gong to have physical existence and these substances attach to the body in unseen dimensions, but nevertheless cause physical, as well as emotional and psychological, health or illness. Through Falun Gong self-cultivation practice, these physical substances and the body itself are transformed. Practitioners perform their identities as 'cultivators', meeting in groups daily for the physical exercises and weekly for reciting Li's texts and reflecting upon, in a sort of communal confessional, their behavior in their everyday lives in relation to Li's ethical teachings. Fieldwork conducted in these settings allows a glimpse into how practitioners understand their own practice and interpret the events and conditions of their own lives, as well as how they construct and maintain those understandings through social practice.

From literature to film to new media, this dissertation historicizes how the prostitute figure---often portrayed as a ""desired other"" situated in-between the public and private---unsettles vying notions of community, nationhood, and globality. The project focuses on two historical junctures at which notions of ""China"" and ""Chineseness"" underwent massive re-configuration, and at which the prostitute figure was prevalent in popular culture: the making of the modern Chinese nation-state at the turn of the twentieth century, and during the Cold War-era. Defining ""Chineseness"" lies at the core of Chinese cultural studies, an academic field long haunted by debates over genetic and political authenticity. Given the emerging prominence of ""China"" in global media, the study of ""Chineseness"" has also gained significance in the context of global humanities. Previous scholarship has investigated ""Chineseness"" largely in terms of ideological or economic projects, and has focused mainly on Sinitic-language cultural production. To this, I contribute my study of ""Chineseness"" from a translingual and transpacific scope, and examine it as a consistently reinvented affective product: shared social sentiments that characterize particular historical moments. Reading the prostitute as an ""affective laborer"" that generates popular imaginaries, I examine the ways political and personal attachments create shifting boundaries of transnational ""Chinese"" worlds, and challenge modern historiography, which has long taken nation-based cultural logics as center.",Taiwan,120.960515,23.69781,6

Education",Education,Dorothy M. Chun,"In the COCA-based test, they were required to correct the same eight collocation errors by consulting COCA and other consultation resources. Thirty out of 140 students who volunteered to have their corpus consultation videotaped were interviewed later. A mixed-methods approach that included quantitative statistics and qualitative analysis was used. The results show that in COCA performance and improvement, learners successfully induced patterns from COCA consultation and corrected collocation errors. They improved approximately 30% in both collocation accuracy and collocation richness after having access. Additionally, even though learners of higher English proficiency performed better, learners across different levels of English proficiency received a similar amount of assistance from COCA. It is concluded that, for learners of all levels of English proficiency, corpus use accompanied by other consultation resources greatly assisted learners in finding collocations, even though data-driven learning (DDL) itself still caused difficulties for learners in the process. Nonetheless, the advantages outweigh the difficulties. Because the use of external consultation resources helps learners to check unfamiliar vocabulary items encountered in COCA use, the key point is to encourage learners to embrace DDL, as this is different from their previous learning styles. Teachers should inform learners of the benefits of learning collocation through corpus and should guide learners in how to coordinate effectively the use of corpus and other consultation resources. As for COCA use, different learners coordinated the corpus use and other consultation resources differently, and they gained benefits and encountered some difficulties when consulting COCA and other consultation resources. Nevertheless, the number of times they consulted COCA was similar among learners across different levels of English proficiency, but lower proficiency learners utilized more of the external consultation resources. Lastly, the COCA Reflection section shows that learners generally found COCA to be helpful and easy to use, but higher proficiency learners had higher evaluations of COCA use. Nonetheless, they did not necessarily think that COCA was easier to use, compared to lower proficiency learners. Corpus-based pedagogy, in which learners consult a corpus and generate patterns from the corpus, has been shown to be effective in collocation teaching and learning. The present research investigated how 140 English learners from Taiwan corrected different types of collocation errors by consulting the Corpus of Contemporary American English (COCA) accompanied by other consultation resources. Three aspects, including COCA performance and improvement, COCA use, and reflection toward COCA use, have been explored together to provide comprehensive understanding. Students were required to take two tests: a paper-based test and a COCA-based test. The paper-based test required them to correct eight collocation errors of different types (verb+noun collocations vs. adjective+noun collocations; easy collocations vs. difficult collocations; L1 congruent collocations vs. L1 incongruent collocations) adapted from their essay writing, by providing three answers to replace each collocation error.",Taiwan,120.960515,23.69781,6

Geography",Geography,Bodo Bookhagen,"High Mountain Asia (HMA) has been strongly impacted by climate change, and will continue to be impacted by diverse climate stressors in the coming years. A combination of changing weather patterns and retreating glaciers has begun to impact water resources in the region; the rate, extent, and mechanisms behind these changes are poorly quantified due to a lack of data and process understanding. As rivers sourced in HMA feed more than a billion people in the region, increased understanding of climate impacts on regional hydrology is essential for effective water management. Glaciers play a diverse role in hydrology throughout the range, with some catchments having little to no reliance on glacial meltwater, and some catchments receiving almost all of their water from glaciers. This study aims to decipher the impact of climate change on glaciers in the Tien Shan mountain range, a large and understudied region that extends roughly 2,800 km northeast from the Pamir Knot in Tajikistan through China, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Mongolia towards the Altai Mountains. As glacial area extents do not present a complete picture of the impacts of climate change on glaciers, the author undertook a pilot study to examine the mass balances of glaciers throughout the range. Mass balance estimates are a proxy for changes in water equivalent stored in a glacier, and are thus essential measurements for understanding the hydrology of the range. The author presents preliminary evidence that high elevation areas in the Tien Shan are thickening, even in the context of retreating glacial tongues. This implies an overall gain of ice mass in the region, despite generally retreating glaciers. This trend was linked to recent increases in precipitation in the range, as well as increases in air temperature. There is not yet enough data to unravel changes in glacier mass balance across the range, although the author predicts that the recently coined 'Karakoram Anomaly' may in fact need to be renamed to include both the Pamir and the western Tien Shan. After validating the algorithm against multiple manually digitized control datasets, the author applied it to a study area encompassing six Landsat scene footprints along the strike of the Tien Shan Orogen. A statistically significant, though minor, gradient in glacier retreat was found, where those glaciers in the west of the range have retreated less than those glaciers in the east. This gradient is explained by differences in regional climate, where large winter storms tend to arrive from the west and break apart and weaken before moving towards the eastern edge of the range. This is substantiated by differences in mean annual precipitation, as derived from Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) 3B43 V7 data, as well as differences in atmospheric lapse rates, where the western region of the range remains cold year-round and the more eastern edges have larger annual temperature fluctuations, as well as a lower overall lapse rate, which implies higher temperatures at higher elevations. Previous studies in the region lack the data to decipher gradients in glacial retreat across the range. To address this data deficit, the author designed and implemented a glacial mapping algorithm which delineates both clean glacial ice---methods which are well documented---and glacial debris tongues, which often require extensive manual digitization. This research is the most significant part of the thesis, and improves upon methods developed to automatically delineate glacial areas using spectral, topographic, velocity, and spatial relationships. The author found that the algorithm misclassifies between 2 and 10% of glacial areas, compared to a ~700 glacier control dataset. These results show significant improvement over previously used methods, as well as large-scale glacier databases such as the Randolph Glacier Inventory (RGI) which are commonly used in mountain-belt scale studies of glaciers.",Tajikistan,71.276093,38.861034,2

History",History,John Majewski,"My dissertation project details the interconnections of race, labor, and land usage overtime from the late-nineteenth to the mid-twentieth-century U.S. South. To examine these themes closely, I focus on the Red Hills region, a forty-mile stretch of land between Thomas County, in southern Georgia, and Tallahassee, Florida. The area became a winter colony for wealthy northern hunters in the decades after Reconstruction, and thus prospered from regional tourism--a growing theme in scholarly studies of the New South. Northern hunters, almost all wealthy industrialists, consolidated land in the region, thus closing lands that would have otherwise been available for small-scale farming and for use as common hunting grounds. They employed a mostly African-American labor force to work on their estates as domestic servants, dog handlers, liverymen, and as sharecroppers and tenant farmers. By displacing whites and employing local blacks, hunting plantations became a divisive force in the town. Plantation owners were concerned with implementing what they considered to be a progressive labor policy with regards to their southern workers. What resulted was a model of welfare capitalism in which white owners created worker communities and subsidized homes, automobiles, and health care, in return for a workforce that remained closely clustered and thus under constant scrutiny. According to oral testimonies and memoirs from black plantation workers, white northerners fostered opportunities for class mobility in a place where labor was limited to agricultural or poorly paid domestic work, but they also circumscribed black action in many ways.

Geography",Geography,"David Lopez-Carr, Phaedon C. Kyriakidis","Our findings show that for effective decision analysis, rather than using coarse aggregated values such as census data at the district level, decision-makers may benefit from the application of multiple simulated spatial distributions of fine scale population along with the associated ARV cost estimates. From this distribution of ARV cost estimates, decision-makers could select best estimates based on an explication of risk attitude, thus avoiding unforeseeable consequences of underestimating or overestimating impact assessment outcomes of HIV prevalence. Spatially explicit impact assessment analyses such as vulnerability studies often require spatially detailed population distribution as input. Downscaled population datasets otherwise known as disaggregated, gridded or fine resolution population datasets are becoming increasingly available at global and regional scales and are based on information from various sources with varying spatial and temporal resolutions as well as reliabilities. Uncertainty is endemic in such downscaled population estimates, particularly in developing countries yet it is hardly assessed. Consequently, decision-makers are potentially faced with a bias problem whereby uncertainties are masked and estimates are presented as unique or expected values even after being derived in a probabilistic context. This research explores how HIV prevalence in three districts of the United Republic of Tanzania might vary with the utilization of simulations of downscaled population estimates. In so doing, this study explores some scenarios in which HIV prevalence that corresponds to minimum expected cost of antiretroviral (ARV) treatment is estimated under three different decision-making attitudes, namely minimax regret, maximin and maximax, followed by a discussion of some implications of any variation in best estimates of HIV prevalence corresponding to the least impact on ARV cost.",Tanzania,34.888822,-6.369028,3

Geography",Geography,Joel Michaelsen,"This dissertation research examines impacts of weather and climate on vegetation productivity in geographically diverse areas of east Africa and the semi-arid Sahel. The focus of this research is how surface energy and water budgets respond to variations in rainfall and temperature. It asks the following questions: Where will warmer temperature pose a hazard to rainfed agriculture in the Sahel in the next 20 years? What environment and weather conditions led to above average surface temperature during the recent decade in east Africa? How have declines in rainfall since the 1980s impacted vegetation productivity and hydrology in Tanzania? The research incorporates a variety of earth observation data, including historical records from in situ, model-derived, and satellite-observed sources and projections from global climate models. A major contribution is the identification of specific areas, mainly in semi-arid climate zones, where increases in temperature and decreases to rainfall have large negative impacts on vegetation productivity. The research also presents new methods for evaluating land-atmosphere interactions in the context of hazards to vegetation. According to the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report, climate change will exacerbate current climate and non-climate stressors on agricultural systems in sub-Saharan Africa. This will adversely impact food security and the wellbeing of communities. Small-scale farmers grow more than 90 percent of the food produced in the region and many households depend on productive local growing conditions to support for their families. A better understanding of recent and near future climate constraints is important for identifying future food security risks and locally-appropriate adaptation strategies.",Tanzania,34.888822,-6.369028,3

History of Art and Architecture",History of Art and Architecture,Nuha N. N. Khoury,"This work re-considers current descriptions of pre-colonial Swahili stone architecture by applying formal analysis to structures from the 'golden age' of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries and the Swahili heartland regions of mainland Tanzania and Kenya. The results of this analysis are compared to mainstream descriptions of Swahili architecture. They are then used to make comparisons between the remains of pre-colonial Swahili stone structures and those in built environments that are popularly identified as essentially 'Islamic.' This project seeks to generate an updated description of early Swahili architecture while providing a useful case study of Islamic architecture at the margins of the field. The data for this work was attained through a combination of archival and onsite research. The latter was carried out through visits to Kenya and Tanzania over the course of two summers, 2006 and 2009. The analysis is separated into sections focusing on religious, domestic and public spaces that were chosen from a cross section of stone town sites. The findings support that pre-colonial Swahili spaces were designed by and for the local Swahili community. The analysis of religious structures suggests that nine-bay mosques may have had a commemorative function. For larger mosques it is proposed that longitudinal orientation and the visual obstruction of the mihrab by central pillars are deliberate (rather than accidental) features that were intended to emphasize the direction of prayer. The analysis of housing reveals that pre-colonial Swahili stone houses exhibit only minimal degrees of visual restriction: the stringently gendered, intimacy gradient that is thought to circumscribe both social and physical Swahili space was a relatively late development that can be linked to the period of Omani colonization in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries. The late colonial period also marks the earliest evidence of a formal relationship between Swahili stone houses and coastal South Arabian houses. The analysis of public space suggests that pre-sixteenth century parallels between Mijikenda and Swahili urban form are tenuous at best. When these parallels exist they can be ascribed to a shared cultural climate without the necessity of identifying direct links between one or another local groups.",Tanzania,34.888822,-6.369028,3

Chicana and Chicano Studies",Chicana and Chicano Studies,"Miroslava Chavez-Garcia, Dolores I. Casillas","My research examines early twentieth-century immigration policies focusing on the experience of ""repatriation"" that tore apart Mexican and Mexican American families throughout the United States. It considers this historical moment as the ""banishment"" of U.S. citizens of Mexican descent to foreground the difference between repatriation, which implies that the person is not a citizen of a given country and banishment, referring to citizens who are banned from their home country. This discursive difference challenges much of the literature that refers to these banishments as ""repatriations"", obscuring the systematic racist and exclusionist immigration policies. The legal, social, and cultural ramifications of banishment on second and third generation descendants of U.S. citizens are largely absent in Chicana/o-Latina/o historiographies and immigration legal studies. My work takes an innovative approach in that it focuses on the prolonged consequences of immigration policies on surviving banished U.S. citizens and their descendants and the link to today's growing legally mixed-status households across the United States. My study demonstrates that U.S. immigration policies continue to ignore the long and complex Mexico-U.S. immigration relations, failing to create adequate paths to legalization for old and new generations of Mexican immigrants. This study centers on the experiences of banishment of three extended families and uses their oral histories across multiple generations to recover and rewrite the history of forced exclusion. The families are composed of surviving U.S. citizens who were banished during the early twentieth century and/or who are descendants of those survivors who have returned to the United States, some as undocumented immigrants. The participating families include the Yanez family, residing in Anaheim, California; the Molina family, spread throughout California, Alabama, and Mexico; and the Robles family, living in Pasadena, California. To allow for personal accounts as well as communal- or family-based interpretations, each family member is interviewed individually and then the entire family is interviewed collectively, providing for a multiplicity of insights and richly texture points of views. In addition to oral histories, this study mines the families' archives, which are composed of photographs, letters, and legal records detailing the experiences of banishment over the course of the twentieth century. Institutional records, including legal histories, archival materials, and demographic data housed at the National Archives in Washington D.C. and the regional branches in Los Angeles, California, as well as El Paso, Texas are used to contextualize the primary research and to reconstruct and reinterpret the immigration policies of the time. My study indicates that these families experienced repatriation in very unique ways, but with a common sense of contempt that extends across family generations, and continue to face real legal and social collateral consequences. My findings demonstrate that an almost 90-year-old unofficial, later becoming official, policy continues to classify direct descendents of banished U.S. citizens as ""illegal"" immigrants in their parents and grandparents' home country. Banishment has resulted in what I term, a transgenerational illegality, which has been nearly impossible to shake. These findings are crucial at a time where immigration remains central to national debates. The twenty original oral histories collected for this study demonstrate that, despite the subjugation of these families, the descendants found ways to challenge their ""illegal"" status, giving rise to the concept of a contested illegality..",Texas,-99.9018131,31.9685988,3

Chicana and Chicano Studies",Chicana and Chicano Studies,"Francisco A. Lomeli, Maria Herrera-Sobek","This dissertation explores how the battle for survival along the border is performed in the terrains of the fantastic and the uncanny, and where the real and the imaginary are not always clearly defined but deeply shaped by the socio-political and racial tensions of the region. In particular, it analyzes how these legends and popular saints are never random nor naive, but rather they are sophisticated ""in-context"" social productions assembled and adapted to respond to specific socio-political and racial-economic transnational realities. This project shows how folklore and pop-culture are useful tools to reconstruct the history of violence along the border and to understand the coping mechanisms developed by Latina/o border communities. The second chapter traces the apparition of El Chupacabras (1994), or goatsucker within the the context of anti-American sentiments in Puerto Rico, the fears and the anxieties of the U.S. post-cold war years, as well as the dismantling of the welfare state. In particular, it analyzes the Chupacabras as a subversive image, used to unify and address the struggles of small farmers and create a sophisticated polysemic metaphor to illustrate the insatiable appetite and predatory practices of neo-liberalism as implemented by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) during the 1990s. The third chapter continues with the study of Juan Soldado (1930s), one of the saints of undocumented border crossers, within the context of the border transformations created by American Prohibition (1920-1933), the Great Depression (1930s), and the mass ""deportation"" of Mexican-Americans and Mexican nationals (1929-1939). This research situates Juan Soldado's conviction for the rape and murder of an eight years old girl, and the subsequent Tijuana riots surrounding this case, as a pivotal event in the long tradition of femicides along the border. I analyze (a) the myth of the Devil along the border, (b) the Chupacabras, the livestock blood-sucking monster; and (c) the legend of Juan Soldado, a saint of undocumented border crossers. These three entities are used in order to create a genealogy of the effects of capitalism in the region, as each of them correlates to crucial periods of U.S.-Mexico relations. The first chapter begins by studying the legend of El Diablo (the Devil) along the U.S.-Mexico Border, in particular as it is narrated in the novel The Devil in Texas/El Diablo en Texas (1976) by Aristeo Brito. It explores the devil within the context of exploitative capitalism in the region and highlights the interconnection between the events of the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), the effects of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo (1848), and the emergence of the modern Chicana/o Movement (1960-1970s). My dissertation examines the U.S.-Mexico border during the 20th century, not only as a socio-political space of conflict and struggle, but simultaneously as a 2,000-mile strip of ""haunted"" land, inhabited by many imaginary creatures, fantastic tales, monsters, and popular saints. It is through an examination of government proceedings, archival documents, religious artifacts, interviews, and ethnographic visits to border shrines and festival celebrations, that this research engages with the question of how communities utilize the fantastic and the uncanny to disseminate knowledge and inscribe history.",Texas,-99.9018131,31.9685988,3

Geological Sciences",Geological Sciences,Alexander R. Simms,"Recent studies along the northwestern Gulf of Mexico document rapid back-stepping of estuarine environments of up to 20 km and 150 m/yr at ca. 8.2 thousand years ago (ka), 4.8, ka, and 2.6 ka. If such rapid changes in coastal environments occurred today along the urbanized coast of the Gulf of Mexico major economical and ecological loss would occur. Of these three backstepping events, only one can be tied to a known cause---the 8.2 ka event related to a rapid increase in the rate of relative sea-level rise. However, the cause of the latter two, the 4.8 and 2.6 ka events are largely unknown. To determine the relative roles of changes in sea level and climate in these two events, paleo sea-level (Chapter 2), climate (Chapter 3), and stratigraphic records (Chapter 4) are presented from upper Baffin Bay, Texas and neighboring playa Laguna Salada. As commonly used high-resolution sea-level indicators are absent from the southern Texas Coast, a new sea-level indicator is needed. I test the use of intertidal microbial mats in reconstructing Holocene sea levels from Baffin, Bay Texas (Chapter 2). The indicative range of microbial mats is +/-0.29 m, much less than the +/-2 m indicative range of typical sea-level indicators currently used along the semiarid Texas coast. The elevations of 22 buried radiocarbon-dated microbial mats plot within error of relative sea-level data derived from the central Texas coast for the past 5.0 ky indicating that microbial mats provide a robust proxy for paleo--sea levels along semiarid and arid coastlines. The high-resolution microbial mat relative sea-level record derived from the tectonically stable central Texas coast also provides a test of recently proposed Holocene Highstands based on emergent coastal deposits in Texas and Alabama. The microbial mat relative sea-level data, similar to relative sea-level data derived from Mississippi Delta basal peats and lower-resolution Texas estuarine bivalves, indicates an ever-decreasing rate of relative sea-level rise since ca. 5.0 ka and precludes the possibility of Holocene Highstands in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Paleoclimate records are also sparse along the southern Texas coast. A new quantitative drought proxy is derived from a transfer function between X-Ray Fluorescence (XRF) elemental data from a Texas playa and a tree-ring drought record (Chapter 3). Using this transfer function, a 954-year tree-ring drought record was extended to ca. 3,000 ka. Ba, Br, and Pb were utilized as predictor variables. Machine learning algorithms, utilized to derive the transfer function, had maximum validation accuracies of 94%. Changes in the extended drought record correspond with the timing of the Roman Climate Optimum, Medieval Warm Period, Little Ice Age, and changes in North Atlantic sea surface temperatures (SST). Increased drought frequency is coeval with nearby dune migration ca. 0.2 ka, 1.9 ka, and 2.6 ka. The highest drought frequency in the record occurs during the Medieval Warm Period ca. 1.0 ka followed by a decrease in drought frequency during the Little Ice Age ca. 0.4 ka. Increased drought frequency accompanies increased North Atlantic SST since 3 ka. This trend of warm North Atlantic SST and dry conditions over the study area follows secular meteorological observations and tree-ring records. These results indicate that lacustrine derived XRF element data can be used as a quantitative tool to reconstruct past drought records, and that North Atlantic SST modulated drought in southern Texas for the last 3,000 years. Within Baffin Bay, five flooding surfaces making periods of abrupt environmental change, between 1.1--1.0 ka, 2.7--2.1 ka, 3.8--3.0 ka, 5.2--4.9 ka, and 6.5--5.7 ka occur through a time-period of ever decreasing rates of relative sea-level rise and within error of periods of drying in southern Texas at ca. 1.0 ka, 2.6 ka, 3.4 ka, 4.8 ka, and 5.5 ka (Chapter 4). I hypothesize that these flooding surfaces, occurring when sea level in the Gulf of Mexico was rising < 2 mm/yr, and during independently documented drying events, were primarily driven by changes in climate through declines in fluvial sediment supply to the coast.",Texas,-99.9018131,31.9685988,3

Education",Education,Jenny Cook-Gumperz,"Both educational and business sectors in Thailand are monitoring the social phenomena associated with managing the transition to a Thai-English bilingual society as the country is merging with other Southeast Asian countries to become a part of ASEAN community in 2015. The goals of this study are to explore how English is presently used in workplaces in Thailand and to suggest how English communication might be improved in intercultural workplace settings. This study employs an ethnographic approach; I conducted participant observation over the course of six months at two separate workplace settings in Thailand, both of which use English as the primary medium of communication and represent two major types of Thailand workplaces in globalized business contexts. The dataset consists of ethnographic fieldnotes and audio-recordings of naturally occurring conversations in the two different workplace situations: business negotiations and staff meetings. I take interactional sociolinguistic (IS) and pragmatic analysis as standpoints and discuss how Thai culture influences the discourse of participants in the two workplaces. The findings reveal three overarching aspects of Thai cultures influencing functional cultures in Thai workplaces: paying respect to social and institutional hierarchy, avoiding direct confrontation, and maintaining group harmony. In addition, indirectness is identified as the preferred negotiation style used by participants in the two workplaces. However, based on the data, indirectness was used more often in the staff meetings than in the business negotiation. The results therefore argue that the degree of direct and indirect negotiation style is not dependent on the cultural backgrounds of interlocutors or the culture of the wider society. On the contrary, the nature of the encounter, the relationship between interlocutors and the cost of negotiation are indicators that participants use explicitly and implicitly to determine the power differences and to choose the appropriate socio-pragmatic conventions to communicate in order to achieve their personal and organizational goals.

The purpose of this study is to explore the various strategies and tactics that helped to shape particular agreement details, in order to provide more insight to our understanding of the dynamics of international economic negotiations. Since the conventional three levels of analysis of International Relations cannot tell which specific outcome may be selected, a problem of multiple equilibria results. I contend that negotiators' bargaining strategies and tactics can solve a multiple equilibria problem as they help explain the specific details of outcomes. This research uses the recent agreement to multilateralize the Chiang Mai Initiative (CMIM), with particular emphasis on the issues of members' financial contributions and vote shares, to analyze negotiation processes. Due to data inaccessibility problems and financial constraints, I chose to focus on five of the most influential players in the CMIM negotiations---Japan, South Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and Thailand. It should be noted that China, though it was an important actor in the CMIM negotiations, is not included in my analysis due to a lack of direct access to Chinese sources. Extensive archival research and in-depth interviews were employed to collect data. Process tracing was a method of analysis. My investigation of the CMIM negotiations reveals that the member states employed several bargaining elements to alter final outcome. States with a lower discount rate (a lower sense of urgency) and a more attractive best alternative to no agreement (batna) were able to walk away with more favorable terms than those with a higher discount rate and less attractive batna. Also, possessing knowledge about other actors' preferences or about issues being discussed (expertise) enhanced states' relative bargaining leverage. Countries took advantage of being a co-chair of the negotiation to turn the agreement terms in their favor. In some circumstances, countries strategically linked issues under negotiation to reap concessions from the others. Additionally, forming a coalition or preventing a coalition of other states from forming sometimes helped states achieve their objectives.",Thailand,100.9925,15.87,2

Religious Studies",Religious Studies,"Jose I. Cabezon, Vesna A. Wallace","One of the oldest narratives detailing the birth of the Indian saint Vimalamitra claims he was the son of an unwed virgin, Dharmabodhi, who was so ashamed that her son had no father and that she had no husband, she buried her newborn under a mound of sand. As she prepared to leave the child to die, she wept until she could no longer bear the pain. Fleeing the burial mound in a grief-stricken state, she looked back one last time and noticed that her child's eyes were glowing so brightly they shone straight through the sand. Startled, she ran back to uncover the young Vimalamitra and raised him to become a Buddhist master. Though Vimalamitra's bright eyes motivated his mother to disinter the buried child, the reasons that Tibetans unearthed the name of an eighth-century Indian scholar to rewrite his legacy and attribute texts en masse to him over three hundred years after he departed Tibet are more difficult to adduce. There are good reasons this is the first comprehensive study of one of the most important saints in Tibetan history. Along with being an important figure, Vimalamitra is one of the most confounding saints from the imperial era. Decade after decade, Tibetan Buddhists wrote, re-wrote, and then re-wrote again the life story of the eighth-century Buddhist saint. Century after century, they constructed namtars (rnam thar), a genre in Tibetan literature that is akin to hagiography. Because a Western conception of historical accuracy was not of chief concern to these authors, as the number of Vimalamitra-related namtars increased, so did the conflicting presentations of the biographical details of the Indian saint's life. As a result, there is little that can be said with any degree of certainty regarding the life and teachings of the ""historical"" Vimalamitra. This study elucidates a previously untold textual history of a millennium-long exchange between a quasi-mythical Indian saint and the Tibetan communities who continuously wrote the tantric (esoteric) texts that bore his name. It details the socio-religious history of the Tibetans who imagined and then re-imagined the persona of Vimalamitra to indigenize Buddhist traditions, establish lineal legitimacy, preserve tantric traditions, create community identities, and perhaps even manufacture the miraculous. The broader purpose of the study is to illuminate the role that an ever-changing Vimalamitra-related mythos played in fomenting, legitimating, and solidifying several developments in Tibetan Buddhist doctrine, practice, and politics, which, when analyzed as a collective, provide a previously untold micro-history of the Nyingma lineage (Rnying ma'i brgyud pa). To accomplish these goals, there are five chief questions addressed throughout the five chapters. (1) What can be said, with some degree of certainty, about the historical Vimalamitra? (2) Why was the historical Vimalamitra transformed into a legendary tantrika capable of performing miraculous deeds comparable to those of the Indian mahasiddhas? (3) How did the legend of Vimalamitra become central to Nyingma history, evolving with the Nyingma tantric tradition over the course of more than a millennium? (4) Why did accounts of Tibetans claiming to witness emanations of Vimalamitra mutate to claims that living Tibetan masters were embodied emanations of the saint? (5) Is it possible to critically re-examine the claims made by the dozens of meditators who recorded experiencing a vision of Vimalamitra? To answer these questions, I pieced together the contributions made by previous scholars, while comparing over one hundred and twenty distinct documents and manuscript fragments linked to Vimalamitra from China, India, and Tibet, spanning fourteen hundred years, from multiple genres of literature on topics as diverse as history, biography, refuge vows, sutras, Vinaya, Abhidharma, Madhyamaka, Yogacara, Yoga Tantra, Mahayoga Tantra, and Dzokchen Tantra. To make sense of this vast amount of data, I created a broad theoretical framework, drawing from numerous disciplines, including religious studies, anthropology, political science, sociology, literary studies, and comic books.",Tibet,88.7878678,30.1533605,3

Religious Studies",Religious Studies,Jose I. Cabezon,"Classical Tibetan Buddhist scriptures proscribe the sale of images of the Buddha, religious texts, and particular ritual implements. Such acts are considered sinful and are believed to carry negative karmic consequences. Prior to the Cultural Revolution, artists and craftsmen were almost always commissioned to create such objects, and they were paid primarily through voluntary offering. This was the socially and religiously accepted means of exchange for such objects. However, following the ""opening-up"" of religion in China, the marketization of China's economy, and the introduction of ethnic tourism to Tibetan areas in the 1980s, Tibetans have begun to sell prefabricated religious objects at fixed, market prices for their personal livelihood in what appears to be a violation of the religious injunctions against their sale. This dissertation aims to understand Tibetans' commodification of Buddhist objects in the contemporary context and focuses on the causes and outcomes of these commercial practices. Drawing upon textual and historical analysis, as well as ethnographic fieldwork conducted in Amdo (Qinghai Province), it argues that we must understand Tibetans' commodification of religious objects not only as a response to the introduction of free market capitalism in China, but also as a Tibetan response to the socioeconomic and political conditions and circumstances resulting from particular policies enacted by the Chinese Communist Party. Furthermore, while Tibetans' commodification of religious objects has led to practical benefits, such practices are also transforming religious traditions, practices, and values in the ""moral economy"" associated with religious objects and contributing to a reinterpretation of Tibetan Buddhist identity. As such, Tibetans' sale of religious objects challenges current and more positivist perspectives on the effects of commodification by revealing that while such practices can have positive results, they come at the price of transforming the traditional worldview.",Tibet,88.7878678,30.1533605,3

Chicana and Chicano Studies",Chicana and Chicano Studies,"Francisco A. Lomeli, Maria Herrera-Sobek","This dissertation explores how the battle for survival along the border is performed in the terrains of the fantastic and the uncanny, and where the real and the imaginary are not always clearly defined but deeply shaped by the socio-political and racial tensions of the region. In particular, it analyzes how these legends and popular saints are never random nor naive, but rather they are sophisticated ""in-context"" social productions assembled and adapted to respond to specific socio-political and racial-economic transnational realities. This project shows how folklore and pop-culture are useful tools to reconstruct the history of violence along the border and to understand the coping mechanisms developed by Latina/o border communities. The second chapter traces the apparition of El Chupacabras (1994), or goatsucker within the the context of anti-American sentiments in Puerto Rico, the fears and the anxieties of the U.S. post-cold war years, as well as the dismantling of the welfare state. In particular, it analyzes the Chupacabras as a subversive image, used to unify and address the struggles of small farmers and create a sophisticated polysemic metaphor to illustrate the insatiable appetite and predatory practices of neo-liberalism as implemented by the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) during the 1990s. The third chapter continues with the study of Juan Soldado (1930s), one of the saints of undocumented border crossers, within the context of the border transformations created by American Prohibition (1920-1933), the Great Depression (1930s), and the mass ""deportation"" of Mexican-Americans and Mexican nationals (1929-1939). This research situates Juan Soldado's conviction for the rape and murder of an eight years old girl, and the subsequent Tijuana riots surrounding this case, as a pivotal event in the long tradition of femicides along the border. I analyze (a) the myth of the Devil along the border, (b) the Chupacabras, the livestock blood-sucking monster; and (c) the legend of Juan Soldado, a saint of undocumented border crossers. These three entities are used in order to create a genealogy of the effects of capitalism in the region, as each of them correlates to crucial periods of U.S.-Mexico relations. The first chapter begins by studying the legend of El Diablo (the Devil) along the U.S.-Mexico Border, in particular as it is narrated in the novel The Devil in Texas/El Diablo en Texas (1976) by Aristeo Brito. It explores the devil within the context of exploitative capitalism in the region and highlights the interconnection between the events of the Mexican-American War (1846-1848), the effects of the Treaty of Guadalupe-Hidalgo (1848), and the emergence of the modern Chicana/o Movement (1960-1970s). My dissertation examines the U.S.-Mexico border during the 20th century, not only as a socio-political space of conflict and struggle, but simultaneously as a 2,000-mile strip of ""haunted"" land, inhabited by many imaginary creatures, fantastic tales, monsters, and popular saints. It is through an examination of government proceedings, archival documents, religious artifacts, interviews, and ethnographic visits to border shrines and festival celebrations, that this research engages with the question of how communities utilize the fantastic and the uncanny to disseminate knowledge and inscribe history.",Tijuana,-117.0382471,32.5149469,4
202,f30k26rr,https://www.alexandria.ucsb.edu/lib/ark:/48907/f30k26rr,Over the Line : Critical Media Technologies of the Trans-American Hyperborder,2015,"Brousseau, Marcel Paul","University of California, Santa Barbara. Comparative Literature",Comparative Literature,Rita Raley,"My project argues that the U.S.-Mexico border is an assemblage of medial forms that are communicated in multiple media without superseding one another. For example, the border is, at once, a graphic design on numerous maps; a symbolic construction in copious literary and legal textual media; a series of fences erected in various terrestrial media; a photographic icon in still and moving pictures; an architectural design; a painted figure; the list goes on. As an assortment of medial forms, The U.S.-Mexico border does not refer to the United States and Mexico as the subjects of its mediation, but rather produces the United States and Mexico as subjects, which thereon depend on the border for their subjectivity, as the border depends on the nations for its continued existence. The United States and Mexico cannot be articulated from or with one another without what media theorist Bernhard Siegert calls ""concrete practices and symbolic operations"" to process their articulation, operations which are ultimately expressed in medial forms, whether lines on maps, untranslatable proper nouns, legal writ, poetic verses, or fences. In drawing connections between the borders produced in different media, I am examining borders as media systems that correspond to different cultural techniques and produce distinct political subjectivities. To envision this network, I develop the concept of the hyperborder, which I define as a border that extends across media. The hyperborder is a framework that links together different mediated borders, and that proposes and examines epistemological connections between them. The hyperborder is a way of attaining a global and comparative view of borders, while at the same time accounting for their different and irreducible media forms. In this project, I examine border forms primarily in three media: literary media, including poetry and prose; cartographic media, with an attention to different cultural meanings of mapmaking; and infrastructural media, particularly types of fencing. My methodology for researching and comparing these different media forms combines archival and participatory research. In order to study textual borders---those found in literary and cartographic media---I have relied on archival research carried out at UC Berkeley's Bancroft Library and in the Special Collections of UCSB's Davidson Library. My desire to account for the location of media has also compelled me to research media forms in the field, so to speak. My analysis of Indigenous mapping in Chapter Two is informed by conversations that I have had with Jim Enote, director of the A:shiwi A:wan Museum and Heritage Center at Zuni Pueblo. My analysis of the U.S.-Mexico border fence in Chapter Three is grounded in physical fieldwork at the site of the fence, particularly with Friends of Friendship Park in San Diego and Tijuana. My combination of archival and participatory research practices allows for a wider view of the border. It also situates my project in numerous academic disciplines and fields, including Comparative Literature, Media Studies, Border Studies, History, Chicana/o Studies, and Indigenous Studies. In developing the comparative framework of the hyperborder, I am making use of the interdisciplinary potential of Comparative Literature, albeit in a way that problematizes the discipline by including what may not be considered ""literary"" in my comparisons. Although originating in Comparative Literature, my methodology has wandered, through the discipline's encyclopedic opening, into Media Studies, where I can compare objects like those listed above through concepts like cultural techniques and knowledge systems. I am mainly applying my Media Studies and Comparative Literature approach in order to intervene in the interdisciplinary field of Border Studies. As an academic specialization, Border Studies leans toward political and social sciences, and often leads to bureaucratic professionalization. My project complements and challenges a social sciences-oriented Border Studies with a humanities-based approach that insists on the media specificity of borders. Similarly, my project is engaged with rethinking the paradigmatic borderlands, as conceptualized by historian Herbert Eugene Bolton in the early 20th century. While my dissertation is grounded in borderlands historiography, my sense of History is directed toward a borderlands of media---toward medial differences, and how they determine boundaries in the symbolic and in the real. A major assertion in my project is that cultural differences correlate to media operations. I thus pay critical attention to the disciplinary frameworks of Chicana/o and Latina/o Studies, and to how their disciplinary stances and social frameworks are articulated with those of History and Border Studies. While older center-periphery historiographies relegated Chicana/o cultural production to regional margins, my project marks how Chicana/o texts address these problematics in media-specific ways.

Geography, Joint Program SDSU","Geography, Joint Program SDSU",Li An,"Traditional spatial analysis and data mining methods fall short of extracting temporal information from data. This inability makes their use difficult to study changes and the associated mechanisms of many geographic phenomena of interest, for example, land-use. On the other hand, the growing availability of land-change data over multiple time intervals and longer time frames, often based on satellite imagery, presents to land-change study a great opportunity, given that this information can be effectively utilized. This methodological gap highlights the need to better understand the analytical challenges brought by temporal complexities, and to investigate alternative analytical frameworks that could handle those challenges. This dissertation attempted to achieve three goals: 1) finding metrics to capture temporal trends, 2) dealing with temporally imprecise data due to constraints of frequency, duration, and starting time of data collection, and 3) handling variables with time-changing values. A simulated land-change dataset based on an agent-based model of residential development and an empirical dataset from two case study sites in San Diego and Tijuana were used for this investigation. Results from the simulation dataset indicated that the survival function and the hazard function are important metrics to reveal temporal trends. In general the results of land-change analysis are sensitive to time frequency, in particular when time-dependent variables are also present. Longer duration benefits land-change analysis since longer durations contains more information. However, time-dependent variables with measures over a long period are more difficult for detection, which may pose a challenge. Starting time also affects the analytical results because the level of process uncertainty varies at different starting times. Findings from real world data mostly agree with those from computational data. Time dependent variables present a major challenge in land-change analysis, and survival analysis can better handle time-independent variables and thus better forecast urban growth.",Tijuana,-117.0382471,32.5149469,4

Spanish and Portuguese",Spanish and Portuguese,Sara Poot-Herrera,"This study analyses and deconstructs the representations of the border and the city of Tijuana through an iconographic approximation. Amongst the many representations of Tijuana there are recurring themes, such as poverty, violence, drugs and prostitution. This study is centered around the character/icon that stands as the masculine archetype of the border: the bandit from the mid XIX century to the beginning of the XX, revolutionary during the XX century, and narco (drug lord) by the end of the XX century and beginning of the XXI. Most of these representations are external in origin and usually follow the parameters of brevity. Some examples are pictures from Battles in Tijuana, tourist postcards, corridos (folklore songs), poems, short stories and American Dime Novels. For almost 200 years, the identity of Tijuana was held hostage by outsider representations. In response, Tijuana developed a new form of representation: a divergent aesthetic. Some of the first exemplars of internal representation regurgitate the simulacra imposed by the external---two-dimensional imaginaries of border identity---but this was due to two main reasons: the need for a homogeneous identity and that this identity caricatured the border and made it more attractive to American tourists, it was simply economically beneficial. There internal representations follow a divergent aesthetic. In the realm of expression or content they follow the guidelines of short form fiction, amongst these features they are: serial, fractal, metafictional, intertextual, elliptic, paradoxical, and hybrid genres. In the realm of the content or story they respond to the previous representations by rejecting any loyalty to form. Amongst other characteristics, divergent literatures create their own non-codes, disassociate from the postmodern, prefer crude reality, make tireless use of mass codes and reject canonical ones, they are self-destructive, have no epiphany, suspense is routine, and they cannot achieve a synthesis. Divergent aesthetics compose an activist literature that questions form, genre, and the parameters of the canonical by exposing representational methods that have formed part of the hierarchical structuring of identities and space within the Tijuana border region.",Tijuana,-117.0382471,32.5149469,4

Political Science",Political Science,Bruce Bimber,"These results reveal the small window of opportunity protesters have to attract public support before news attention wanes and underscore the importance of protester tactics in shaping the narratives of coverage. Protesters have to strategically weigh the costs of confrontational tactics because such tactics can elicit more news attention to the protest, but these tactics might overshadow the core message of the protest itself. To identify the frame-changing dynamic occurring over time, I conducted a content analysis of the news coverage of Occupy Wall Street and the G20 protests in London, Pittsburgh and Toronto. The study identifies longitudinal changes in news frames about the substantive issues of a protest and the conflict that ensues between protesters and city officials during a protest. Findings suggest that conflict has a significant impact on the number of news stories about protests. Further, the results demonstrate how news framing opportunities change as a movement reaches different stages of the news attention cycle. The cases studied here illustrate that when the protests grew, journalists focused on the protesters' grievances, including economic inequality, bank bailouts, ending the Iraq War, and climate change. As the movements peaked, news attention shifted to the intensifying conflict between city officials and protesters. Ultimately, prolonged conflict is typically followed by a decline in protest news interest. When protests are successful, they force us to realize another world is possible. To be successful they have to communicate their message effectively and be persuasive. News coverage can often determine whether a protest will be successful or unsuccessful at amplifying its message and persuading audiences. This dissertation examines the relationship of news organizations and protest movements. It asks three primary research questions. First, how does news attention to a protest rise and fall over time? Second, do news organizations pay attention to the causes and grievances of protesters? Third, how does news framing of a protest change over time? To answer these questions, I develop a theoretical model, the protest news framing cycle, and present the results of a longitudinal analysis of news attention and framing of protest movements.",Toronto,-79.3831843,43.653226,1

Computer Science",Computer Science,Timothy Sherwood,"When faced with complex design, analysis, or engineering tasks, novices and professionals alike attempt to better understand problems through diagrams, and a natural first step in this process is working on a whiteboard. Through their drawings, people can gain valuable insights into subtleties of design and analysis tasks, but once a diagram gains sufficient complexity, further progress becomes tedious (or even intractable) without the aid of a computer. Sketch recognition interfaces over the last few decades have sought to ease this barrier to entry through pen-based interaction, enabling users to directly sketch the structures they want to analyze, leveraging their previous experience with drawing diagrams. From circuit design, chemical analysis, and even 3D modeling, these applications have allowed people to more effectively utilize the power of computation in their everyday work. Unfortunately, despite providing a more familiar interaction style, interface hardware requirements mean that sketch recognition interfaces still go largely unused; desktop-scale pen capture displays presently remain largely relegated to CAD firms or art studios, with the whiteboard-scale equivalents, necessary for collaborative design tasks, being even more exotic. The goal of this work is to utilize common consumer hardware (webcams, smartphones, and projectors when available) to enable sketch recognition where people are already drawing: whiteboards, chalkboards, and even on loose paper. In service of this goal, we have created SPARK, the Sketch Practically Anywhere Recognition Kit. Our system enables a person to interact with real world drawings by recognizing meaning from images of hand drawn diagrams that are captured via a smartphone or a webcam, and by providing an interface through augmenting projectors or the phone's own display. The system is constructed in three parts: a stand-alone stroke-based sketch recognition framework, a module for extracting stroke data from static images, and finally a component to extract key frames from a video stream of an active whiteboard for interactive recognition. As evidence of our methods, we have created a series of prototype applications that exercise each module: SketchVis applies traditional, virtual stroke sketch recognition techniques to data exploration through charting on a whiteboard-scale interface. Our Turing machine app enables simulation of Turing machine diagrams drawn with physical ink through a mobile, explicit capture interface. Finally, the equation graphing application serves as a proof of concept exercise of the continuous sketch recognition of--and interaction with--physical ink captured with a webcam.",Turin,7.6868565,45.070312,2

History",History,Carol Lansing,"This dissertation is a case study in medieval religious life. Using a remarkable collection of extant sources, including inquisitorial records, episcopal protocols, and castellan's rolls, I examine an exciting period in the religious history of Chieri, a town located near Turin in the Italian Piedmont, between the mid-1360s and 1412. These decades saw the rise and fall of a non-Catholic movement whose participants rejected almost every doctrine of the Catholic Church and believed that the devil ruled the world. More than one hundred people participated in the movement, and it received the attention of at least three inquisitors. Seventeen people (fifteen of them already dead) were condemned and burned. During that time period, there were also some key developments within the local Catholic Church. In 1383, twelve laymen founded the town's largest hospital, named in honor of the Virgin Mary, and the speedy participation of many donors ensured that the hospital became almost a public work of piety. In 1399, a large number of Chieri's people turned out for an extraordinary procession, crying ""Mercy"" as they marched to the all the town's churches. Finally, in 1405, under the leadership of the cathedral chapter, the community began a major reconstruction of the Duomo, the town's most important church. I argue that these key developments in the local Catholic Church were intimately linked to the story of Chieri's non-Catholic movement. At first, Catholic and non-Catholic religiosity flourished side by side, yet later, when the community renewed its commitment to Catholicism at the turn of the fourteenth century, the non-Catholic movement disappeared. Further, I argue that individuals used Chieri's religious environment to craft distinctive, personal religious experiences.",Turin,7.6868565,45.070312,2

Global and International Studies",Global and International Studies,Paul Amar,"This paper looks at small arms transfers to non-state actors in the Syrian conflict as an under analyzed aspect of intervention in intrastate war that is both globalized and potentially destabilizing. I challenge the dominant narrative that the international community has failed to intervene in Syria, by pointing to the manifold government-funded arms transfers to opposition groups beginning in 2012. I find that there are two significant networks of arms trafficking: one through Jordan with Saudi Arabian and American support; the other through Turkey with Qatari support. These patterns and rivalries between donor countries have contributed to three processes within the transformation from revolution to civil war: militarization, increased sectarianism, and fragmentation of the opposition.

I challenge the dominant narrative that the international community has failed to intervene in Syria, by pointing to the manifold government-funded arms transfers to opposition groups beginning in 2012. I find that there are two significant networks of arms trafficking: one through Jordan with Saudi Arabian and American support; the other through Turkey with Qatari support.

French and Italian",French and Italian,"Jon R. Snyder, Jody Enders","In exploring the use of specific units of French farce in Tuscan comedy, this study aims to elucidate the ways in which a revised poetics of imitation within select experimental literary academies of the Renaissance not only favored the transgression of classical models but also triggered the explosive growth of hybrid genres. Finally, intercalation of French farce in Italian comedy sheds new light on the integration of Renaissance Italian theatrical culture in France at the end of the sixteenth century and raises issues of ""international relations"" in the field of theatrical studies. This study analyzes the experimental use of units of theater from the medieval French farce tradition in Pierantonio Stricca Legacci's Cilombrino (1518), Salvestro Cartaio's Il Travaglio (The Torment) (1552), and Antonfrancesco Grazzini's L'Arzigogolo (The Quibble) (c. 1580). It asks questions such as: Did French military presence in Italy or the substantial Italian population in France have a specific effect on the theatrical productions of the sixteenth century? For what reasons would the French farce have appealed to experimental Tuscan literary academies of the sixteenth century, and how would Tuscan playwrights have come into contact with the French genre? In what ways were units of farce appropriated as models of progressive theater for and by these academies? Finally, what role did politics play in the comedic creations of the sixteenth-century theater? Could only laughter speak the truth to power as embodied by the French monarchy and the Medici regime? How did this hybrid comic theater critique the conventions of humanist imitation? By examining the formal relationships between medieval French farce and Italian Renaissance comedy through close investigation of thematic and textual borrowings, as well as stagecraft, this study authenticates Tuscan comedy as a ""contact zone"" for transalpine intercultural exchange, involving both material exchanges (print, letters, staging features, audio-visual effects) and semiotic ones (symbols, themes, topoi). The French farce appealed to the experimental, avant-garde Tuscan dramatists of the sixteenth century as a model from which to appropriate a new kind of comic theater. Through the intercalation of Tuscan drama with the French farce, playwrights of the Congrega dei Rozzi in Siena and the Accademia degli Umidi in Florence created some of the first examples of hybrid genres of early modern theater; this intertextual phenomenon continued to gain popularity throughout the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. By probing the connection between politics and the French farce, I show how inimitably suited this genre was to the needs of sixteenth-century Tuscan dramatists. This theatrical tradition allowed for the representation of key social tensions and contradictions that humanist comedy may otherwise have been unable to express theatrically without threatening to disrupt and undermine social stability. With an emphasis on interaction of theatrical forms, as well as a focus on the social, cultural, and historical factors that influenced these cultural productions, this dissertation offers a socio-semiotic reading of the construction of early modern European comedy, particularly in regard to humanism, imitation, and international cultural exchange.",Tuscany,11.2486,43.7711,1

Global and International Studies",Global and International Studies,"Eve Darian-Smith, Alison Brysk","The central African region is currently experiencing massive conflict, much due to the emergence of violent non-state actors. Anti-state rebel militia groups, predominantly located in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) and the Central African Republic (CAR), regularly challenge the state's supposed monopoly of violence and engage in immense human rights abuses against civilian populations. Various efforts to address these atrocities have included global governance responses such as International Criminal Court indictments, United Nations peace accords, African Union treaties, bilateral peace talks, and the involvement of international and local civil society. Additionally, efforts to abate conflict comprise of various forms of intervention including military, economic, legal, and relief intervention. Also, upholding international law, including both human rights law and international humanitarian law, and the introduction of post-conflict management have worked to address militia groups in numerous ways with wide-ranging results. Issues involving sovereignty, weak states, international intervention, and neo-colonialism are all brought to the forefront when looking at rebel militia violence in this region. The questions then that this study seeks to answer are: What are some non-conventional issues present in conflict that must be addressed in order to realize long-term sustainable peace? What role does transitional justice, both at the local and international level, play in conflict resolution and peacebuilding?

Despite being an integral component to decreasing the dependence on oil rents and diversifying the economy through construction, workers in this industry are severely mistreated. This study seeks to provide a comprehensive overview of workers' rights in the construction industry in the UAE. The central research question framing this study is: what are the labor violations faced by workers and to what degree has the UAE government responded to these issues? The follow up questions are then, have working conditions improved and what are the challenges in improving these conditions? This study employs a qualitative approach, drawing on current literature in order to answer the central research questions. The discussion in this paper is based on an analysis of the information collected through archival research and is divided into 7 chapters. The penultimate chapter of this thesis features a case study of Abu Dhabi's $27 billion megaproject, Saayidat Island, which is home to the new Guggenheim, Louvre, and New York University (NYU) satellite campus. This current case study will be used in order to examine the status of workers' rights violations and the level of enforcement of government policy on labor issues. After a review of government policy on labor, this paper concludes that the UAE does not lack legislation on labor issues, but rather lacks enforcement of these laws. Thus, this study finds that the largest hurdles to enforcing labor laws is the level of crony capitalism between the government and the construction industry and the disposability of labor. This study hypothesizes that the partnerships Abu Dhabi is building with big international names at Saayidat Island, like the Guggenheim and Louvre museums and also universities like New York University, may serve as a tipping point and bring more international scrutiny to violations of workers' rights in this industry. The hope is that mounting international pressure, as seen in Qatar leading up to the 2022 World Cup, will encourage the UAE to go beyond responding to these issues at the institutional level and motivate them to enforce the labor laws on the ground. In the 1960s the United Arab Emirates (UAE) struck oil. Over the years, the UAE has increasingly invested in an array of sectors to reduce economic dependence on hydrocarbon exports. All sectors that the UAE is actively investing in, are not only global but require infrastructure development. Between the Emirates of Dubai and Abu Dhabi there are currently about 1,300 construction projects in development worth over $418 billion (Sonmez et al., 2011). The Emirates lack the domestic labor force required to support these construction endeavors. For this reason, the UAE is largely dependent on migrant labor.",United Arab Emirates,53.847818,23.424076,1

My work advances current scholarship on the legacy of nineteenth-century culture by focusing on an area of critical oversight in neo-Victorian studies: the ""middlebrow,"" or the cultural space where high art merges with mass culture. Despite scholars' tendency to ignore the middlebrow in favor of ""high brow"" works, I demonstrate that middlebrow culture is not only worthy of academic inquiry, but that it is in fact integral to contemporary conceptions of the nineteenth century within both popular and academic circles. To this end, I investigate a diverse body of cultural objects, including adaptations of Jane Austen's novels in fiction and film; the prolific afterlife of Jack the Ripper; reinterpretations of Victorian media in contemporary film and comics; and the practice of ""visiting"" the Victorian through literary tourism. I argue that these seemingly disparate objects and activities all function according to a similar logic of imaginative play. Recent research has shown that play is a formative mode of human behavior that contributes to identity formation and our ability to imagine the minds of others. Using theories of play drawn from cultural history, psychoanalysis, and developmental psychology, I assert that the nineteenth century has come to function as a cultural and psychological playground within the middlebrow, a space that allows its players to work through contemporary anxieties about cultural change, shifting gender and sexual mores, modern violence, and evolving media. My work demonstrates that, despite prevalent assumptions that middlebrow culture's use of the nineteenth century is an exercise in uncritical nostalgia, middlebrow appropriations of this period often function as productive--if at times problematic--modes of historical engagement that, through play, promote social understanding and self expression. These reiterations of the nineteenth century offer significant insight into the period's cultural legacy, the uses of history in contemporary culture, and the role of play in modern life.",United Kingdom,-3.435973,55.378051,6

It draws on the archives of the Society for the Promotion of Nature Reserves, founded in 1912, which invoked a threatening rhetoric of Nature's total exhaustion under the march of modern development. Literary modernism's presentation of human fragility amidst exhausted environments challenged problematic industrial and imperial narratives of unlimited progress and generated new modes of ecological awareness in the 20th century. Faced with the restless and inescapable forces of modernization, modernist writers shifted away from the withdrawn, ""restful contemplation"" of the Romantics and moved towards an increasingly materialist attention to the world as an immersive stream of human and nonhuman connections that are interdependent and hierarchical in problematic ways. The Anglophone novel, as it develops through D. H. Lawrence, Virginia Woolf, James Joyce, Djuna Barnes, Jean Rhys and Chinua Achebe, becomes increasingly attuned to constructions of personal, social and planetary identity in relation to environmental exploitation.

History",History,Patricia Cline Cohen,"This dissertation examines the United States-based communitarian socialists known as the Fourierists as a piece of the larger international Fourierist movement, highlighting the numerous points of contact between Fourierists and their counterparts on each side of the Atlantic. My goal is to understand Fourierism as a multinational movement that sparked an international conversation among its members, which made it one of the most cosmopolitan of the reform movements to emerge from the social tumult in the 1840s. Its Janus-faced focus on the U.S. reform landscape and fixed connection with European Fourierists made Fourierism arguably the most dynamic reform movement of the nineteenth century. It is a story of connectivity among individuals who believed they possessed a new moral framework for remaking the world. The theories of the French social philosopher Charles Fourier also helped change the course of antebellum reform in the United States by introducing important themes and an entirely new vocabulary to the reform lexicon. The strength of the Fourierist press in the United States, especially the celebrated journal The Harbinger, highlights the movement's fingerprint on the course of American journalism. I will explore how and why this movement spread so far from the 1830s-1850s, and how these activists transcended national identity in order to realize the plan of perfecting the world's ills through the adoption of Fourier's experimental living arrangements. As a movement based on experiment, exchange, and collaboration, Fourierism intermingled freely with other mid-century reform movements including abolition, women's rights, free love, as well as workingmen's and other socialist movements. Traveling Fourierist leaders, the growth of Fourierist journalism, and the community of early Fourierists in New York City fostered complex identities in those at the heart of the movement. Their involvement in multiple causes demonstrates the international roots of mid-nineteenth-century reform. While adherents in each nation adapted Fourier's message to their own specific national context, the fluidity of the larger philosophy transcended borders, helping create an international reform identity in an age usually best known for a parochial nationalism. Using archival sources and published journals and periodicals from France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, this dissertation follows a chronological analysis of the movement's international layers. I examine the period from the movement's inception in the 1830s to its height in 1846, focusing on Fourierism's importation to the United States and its evolution from a cosmopolitan group of European and Francophone expatriates in New York City to a more Americanized version championed by Horace Greeley and Albert Brisbane with intentional appeal to workingmen. I also focus on the decline of Fourierism in the late 1840s, the pivotal year of the French Revolution of 1848, and the growth of the Free Love movement from Fourierism's ashes in the early 1850s. This dissertation compels scholars to look closer at the Fourierist movement as a case study in successfully changing the vocabulary of social reformers, bringing attention to the problems inherent within industrial capitalism, offering an inclusive approach to labor reform which included women's rights, and an alternative to the bourgeois home. Fourierism was at the center of a dialogue on gender norms and sexuality that would ultimately include members of the organized women's rights movement and advocates of the controversial free love movement. The Fourierist movement's communal ethos promised to improve the lives of women by ameliorating the drudgery of housework and providing shared child-rearing opportunities. Additionally, Charles Fourier's highly controversial theories on sexual liberation and marriage reform led some Fourierists to challenge reigning sexual mores. Studying the works of the Fourierists reveal new insights into the attitudes about gender and sexuality within the larger world of mid-nineteenth-century reform in the United States and Europe. Fourierism inspired a debate about gender, marriage, and religion that changed the language and tactics of mid-nineteenth-century reform.",United Kingdom,-3.435973,55.378051,6

It then traces the role of migration in the attempt to reinvent empire as Commonwealth in the decades after the Second World War as the British government encouraged migration to the Dominions and Southern Rhodesia despite a labor shortage. Using debates surrounding immigration, it highlights the tensions in South Africa and Southern Rhodesia as minority settler colonial regimes between gaining more white population and ensuring racial prestige in the 1940s and 1950s.Though always determined by race, by the 1960s, selective policies based on nationality and class gave way to more aggressive recruitment of immigrants defined by these states as white as a demographic defense of minority rule in a rapidly decolonizing continent. Though such efforts bore limited results in war torn Rhodesia, South Africa saw a dramatic increase of European and particularly British migration from the 1960s to the early 1980s. Alongside this political and demographic study, it uses migrant oral histories, biographies and letters to reveal the ongoing personal and familial ties between these nations and Britain, and the persistence of imperial migration networks even after the collapse of formal empire.

It is the first comprehensive study this period, which had been neglected in historiography of international relations during the Second World War. Specifically, this work explores such subjects as the nature of Soviet foreign policy under Stalin, origins of the Grand Alliance between the USSR with the western powers as well as the Soviet Union's role in the context of the global struggle of World War II. This dissertation examines these themes from a perspective of international history. Extensive use of primary sources gathered from archives in Russia, the United Kingdom, and the United States allows providing new, more nuanced evaluations of subjects under analysis. Specifically, this work concludes that Soviet foreign policy under Stalin operated on the basis of power politics, with considerations of the balance of power and security being paramount for Soviet policymakers. Soviet diplomats during the Second World War more often resembled practitioners of Realpolitik than revolutionary ideologues. Their practical analysis of international relations, however, was conditioned by an ideological Leninist model that often skewed their interpretation of political developments. Additionally, this study finds that the Soviet Union played an important role in the global conduct of the war. Not only was it heavily involved in the war in Europe, but it was also a significant factor in the struggle between the Allies and the Axis in the Far East. This does not mean, however that the Soviet Union was a fully-fledged member of the Grand Alliance from the beginning of its participation in the war. This dissertation argues that the Soviets and the western powers formed a tenuous association until 1943, fighting largely separate wars and being preoccupied with divergent political interests. By the end of 1943, however, the Soviet Union became a full partner in the wartime coalition, participating in formulation of common military strategy and plans for establishment of a new world order on equal footing with Great Britain and the United States.",United Kingdom,-3.435973,55.378051,6

Religious Studies",Religious Studies,Catherine L. Albanese,"This dissertation is a study of conservative white evangelical discourse on HIV/AIDS. Specifically, I look to the continuities and changes in evangelical rhetoric about the disease since the early 1980s, and the ways that race, gender, sexuality, class, and nation intersect and are utilized in these discourses. I argue that beginning in the late 1990s the baby boomer generation of conservative evangelicals began reframing the culture wars discourse around AIDS, which had controlled evangelical responses to the disease during the 1980s and 1990s. This paradigm constructed HIV/AIDS as a disease that was a problem for gay men (typically white gay men) and drug users as the product of sinful behavior. As a result, this earlier generation frequently denounced public funding to fight the disease and remained disengaged from work to help people with AIDS and battle the epidemic. However, this discourse shifted when the baby boomer generation of conservative evangelicals started taking over leadership of the movement, and they reworked the culture wars framework in order to convince their coreligionists to change their perspectives on HIV/AIDS and become engaged in addressing the disease. This generation has changed the evangelical outlook on and government responses to AIDS in four main ways: acknowledging the potential for missionary activity; presenting the disease as a global (mainly Third World), heterosexual problem; emphasizing the opportunity to teach conservative evangelical sexual standards; and calling attention to ""innocent"" victims of the disease, particularly orphans and some women. In this way, baby boomer evangelicals have maintained underlying commitments to culture wars concerns, especially to heteronormativity, while shifting the larger framework. With a strong emphasis on AIDS in the Third World, the epidemic in the United States has been written largely out of the baby boomer narrative on the disease, despite the continuing devastation it causes here, especially in communities of color. This dissertation contains three chapters. The first chapter is a historical survey of evangelical AIDS discourses and emphasizes both continuity and change over time. The second chapter is a case study of Rick and Kay Warren and their work to reframe the disease.

Busto,"The Afterlives of the Vietnam War bridges religious studies, Asian American cultural studies, and Vietnamese American studies, offering the concept of politics of meaning as a theoretical and methodological intervention for understanding the relationships between religion, culture, power, and agency. Here, meaning-making is a contested, political process that reflects the religious dimension of social and cultural life, and Vietnam War cultural memory is a critical site for understanding contemporary modes of meaning in the U.S. This dissertation reveals the religious structure that dominates national meaning-making in the U.S. as racialized American civil religion, and traces the struggles of minorities, particularly Vietnamese Americans, to assert different meanings as a means of survival. At stake here is both a scholarly intervention in how we understand culture and a political intervention in how we understand the human toll of cultural domination. The dissertation examines three cultural sites and asks how each makes meaning as they remember and narrate the Vietnam War. I begin with the Vietnam Veterans Memorial, as a centerpiece of a contemporary racialized American civil religious discourse deploying the languages of ""apolitics"" and ""healing"" that unevenly includes and excludes racial minorities. I then move from ""majority memory"" to ""minority memory"" in two Vietnamese American cultural productions. Ham Tran's film, Journey from the Fall (2007), intervenes in dominant American filmic war memory by centering the refugee nuclear family to define trauma, healing, and Vietnamese peoplehood, while Aimee Phan's story story collection, We Should Never Meet (2004), renarrates the Vietnam War through the marginal figures of mothers and transnational adoptees, to redefine violence and trauma in the context of war, race, and gender. Through these texts, The Afterlives of the Vietnam War outlines the contours of religious, racial, and post-war structures that shape life in the U.S. and the ways Vietnamese Americans draw upon, push against, and exceed those structures, to reveal both the human cost and the human possibilities of that life.",United States,-95.712891,37.09024,4

With this dissertation, I bring needed attention to the ways in which the Iranian case complicates sociological understandings of assimilation, whiteness, and racialization in the contemporary United States. Drawing from over 80 in-depth interviews and more than 750 hours of ethnographic research among Iranian-heritaged teenagers and young adults (ages 13--28), I argue that Iranian identity in the U.S. takes shape within a fundamental dissonance between the community's legal ethno-racial classification as ""white"" and its lived experiences of specificity and subordination in relation to racial projects like the U.S.-led War on Terror. I assess youth-driven phenomenon in three case studies: the micro-level interactions that contest empire and race in one Title VI-funded ""critical"" Persian language classroom; the collective forms of ""inherited nostalgia"" developed in a University Middle Eastern Resource Center; and the construction of new forms of ethnic humor at a diasporic summer camp. The analysis across these case studies challenges existing scholarship that relies on theories of cultural trauma and stigma to assert a vision of Iranian American youth seeking entry to a white and normatively ""American"" ethno-racial formation. Instead, I present evidence of push and pull factors away from assimilationist practices: these range from prejudice and discrimination deployed by others whose white and ""American"" identities are uncontested, through acts of cultural resistance, both small and large, that situate ""Iranianness"" as a powerful marker of ethno-racial specificity in an increasingly hostile social and political climate. For these youth, who in fact largely self-identify as racial, ethnic, and religious minorities in the U.S. setting, it is precisely the cultural and social practices they mark as ""Iranian"" or proudly ""unassimilable,"" which serve as powerful source material for self-confidence, social activism, civic enfranchisement, cross-racial solidarity, and transnational belonging.",United States,-95.712891,37.09024,4

Anthropology",Anthropology,Michael Glassow,"To reconstruct ceramic production and consumption pattern, laser-ablation inductively couple plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) was conducted on 1,069 sherds from the Mt. Trumbull/Tuweep and the lowland Virgin areas, along with source clay samples collected from the same areas. To examine how the use of clay resources changed over time, optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) dating was conducted on 113 sherd samples with compositional information. Ultimately, the goal of this study is to understand why ceramic production and circulation patterns changed during the Ancestral Pueblo occupation of this peripheral area of the American Southwest. I hypothesize that ceramic production and regional interaction patterns were shaped in part by the need to minimize subsistence risk in this marginal agricultural environment. The data presented here suggest that different environmental conditions favored different social interaction and local ceramic production patterns. In Mt. Trumbull, under unstable climatic conditions and low population density, near the beginning of the Puebloan occupation, pots moved along with human migration. Later, when populations were higher and environmental conditions were equally unstable, pots were moved through interregional trade. In addition, clay resource specialization was favored early but was replaced later by exclusive use of optimal clays when population numbers were higher. In the lowland Virgin area, exchange played an important role as a risk minimization strategy throughout the Puebloan occupation, but clay-resource specialization gained importance later on, when populations increased. The Arizona Strip and adjacent areas in Utah and Nevada are in a very marginal environment. This dissertation investigates how small-scale farmers who survived more than 1000 years in this area coped with the challenges of this marginal environment by examining how and why social interaction patterns varied over time in different parts of the region. Artifact assemblages from this area that date between A.D. 200 and 1350 are characterized by widely distributed ceramics tempered with olivine, a volcanic mineral. Sources of olivine lie in the vicinity of Mt. Trumbull and Tuweep, near the northwestern part of the Grand Canyon. The olivine-tempered ceramics were distributed mostly westward from Mt.

Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology","Ecology, Evolution, and Marine Biology",Carla D'Antonio,"The meta-analysis showed negative effects of non-native plant invasions on arthropod richness, which are in part determined by the abundance of the invader, and are greatest at high levels of invader abundance (70% cover or greater). My field research showed that these effects vary by site, season, and sampling technique/stratum, and are apparently modulated by the characteristics of both the invader and the invasion itself, including growth patterns, litter production, invader abundance, and native plant diversity. Even a relatively small amount of Carpobrotus edulis has negative effects on arthropod abundance, richness, and composition, with an exponential decrease in abundance and richness and a shift in composition well before 50% Carpobrotus cover. Changes in feeding guilds and composition helped to suggest the drivers of these patterns, and revealed a particularly strong effect on fossorial arthropods, likely related to the dense rooting structure of Carpobrotus. Thus, while the negative effects of non-native plant invasions typically increase with increasing invader cover, the form of this relationship is determined by the attributes of both the invader and the invaded system. For my dissertation work, I asked what effect non-native plant invasions are having on entire arthropod assemblages, and how that effect is related to the degree of invasion. I further asked how the responses by component feeding guilds contribute to these relationships. I answered these questions by conducting a meta-analysis and review of existing studies, then investigating the effects of one invader, Carpobrotus edulis, on coastal dune arthropods at four different coastal California sites. At Vandenberg Air Force Base, Montana de Oro State Park, and San Buenaventura State Beach, I utilized unmanipulated Carpobrotus populations to compare paired invaded and uninvaded patches and to investigate a gradient of Carpobrotus infestation. At Coal Oil Point Reserve, I conducted an experimental restoration trial, removing varying amounts of Carpobrotus and re-vegetating with native dune plants. Invertebrate responses to plant invasions can help delineate the drivers of biodiversity and community patterns, thus guiding the conservation and restoration of diverse native ecosystems. Although it is well known that invasive species have pervasive effects on native communities and ecosystems, our knowledge of the relative contributions of, and interactions among, key factors determining invader impacts is limited. Among potentially key factors is invader abundance, but few studies have examined its relationship to community structure. Those studies have shown varying relationships between invertebrate assemblages and invader cover, illustrating the need for additional studies on the forms and mechanisms of relationships between invertebrate biodiversity and invasive plant abundance.",Vandenberg Air Force Base,-120.5724404,34.7420267,1

Music",Music,Derek Katz,"My dissertation investigates Maurice Durufle (1902--1986) and Jean Langlais's (1907--1991) written and musical protestations of Vatican II's liturgical reforms. The composers' initial writings (1960--1969) communicate their determination to preserve chant and the organ, reflected in their music through the presence of a ""transcendent"" harmonic language. Characterized by intervallic symmetry, this language has historical associations with the otherworldly in fin-de-siecle art music. Beginning in the 1930s, French organist-composers known as the French Organ School applied the ""transcendent"" language to Gregorian chant melodies, Latin, and the organ to highlight vertical (human-to-God) dimensions of Catholic liturgy in their sacred music. The French Organ School consequently privileged the Church's identity as a transcendent institution, as existing outside space and time, through music. They then used it to combat what they perceived to be the desacralization of the liturgy after Vatican II. Nonetheless, Durufle and Langlais saw no improvement over the years, and their resolve eroded. Shown in their later writings (1970--1983), they surrendered to this state of affairs either by ironically re-contextualizing or by ceasing use of the ""transcendent"" harmony altogether. Durufle and Langlais expressed ideas similar to sociologists and theologians concerning the loss of transcendence, but they did so through musical language in addition to their writings. By analyzing their compositions, I rescript history of Catholic Church reform in the latter half of the twentieth century through musical language. I show that the music and letters of Durufle and Langlais capture themes that theologians and sociologists have articulated in their work on Vatican II and on twentieth-century Catholicism. As bishops implemented the reforms of the Council, their primary goal was to foster active participation among congregations. Theologians and sociologists have maintained that a consequence of the goal of participation was an over-privileging of relevance, understanding, and inculturation into a liturgy, historically characterized by symbolism, sensory experience, and counterculture. Anything characterized by the latter features---the ""otherness"" of Latin, chant, ritual actions, and the notion that the Church exists outside of time and space---became stigmatized after Vatican II. In short, the Church experienced a loss of transcendence. This shift in liturgical aesthetic consequently included the music that the French Organ School favored. In 1962, the Roman Catholic Church commenced with its twenty-first ecumenical council, Vatican II. Priests from around the world gathered to debate and decide on several issues with the goal of modernizing Catholicism while still maintaining its historical tradition. In addition to discussing abstract matters such as the nature and existence of God, the Council Fathers discussed practical issues, among them being the kind of music appropriate for ritual worship, the liturgy. Throughout Western history, the Catholic Church has cited in its documents Gregorian chant sung in Latin and the pipe organ as the musical expressions best suited for ritual worship. Vatican II's Constitution on the Sacred Liturgy, Sancrosanctum Concilium, drew from Church history and recognized chant and the organ's importance as previous conciliar documents and papal writings have done. Yet the Constitution also authorized the use of different styles, languages, and instruments. Once bishops, priests, and liturgists began implementing the reforms, however, folk tunes, jazz and rock styles sung exclusively in the vernacular largely replaced Latin and chant, while strumming guitars, percussion, and piano ensembles supplanted the organ. Amid this revolution, a number of French organist-composers critiqued the liturgical changes through the written word and music.",Vatican City,12.453389,41.902916,1

Film and Media Studies",Film and Media Studies,Cristina Venegas,"In this dissertation, I examine Bolivarian media during the Presidency of Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez Frias (1998--2013), leader of the Bolivarian Revolutionary project. Analyzing both ALBA (Bolivarian Alliance for the Americas) and opposition discourses, I consider the importance of consolidating a counter-hegemonic media presence as well as state media policies and the transnational and global political infrastructure of the Caracas-based, multi-state satellite TeleSUR (Television of the South) television network. I also textually analyze the practices of some of TeleSUR's programs to demonstrate the way in which the network contributes to the hyperbolic and ubiquitous presence of Chavez in the media and its use of cultural programming to define the focus of a Global South cultural agenda. I suggest that TeleSUR is part of an emergent model of national media systems, which in the context of neoliberal globalization, resists the global media hegemony of the West in new transnational maneuvers through new alliances with regional and global actors across Internet, cable and satellite platforms and its promotion of ALBA. One of the geopolitical goals of the TeleSUR initiative is to build an enduring regional and global infrastructure through these media platforms to challenge the Global Northern media monopoly on many fronts, resulting in what I argue is an incipient Global South ""nation-building"" project, imbricated in regional, national, transnational and local identities. But to build this infrastructure, the Bolivarian state is using an antiquated, bureaucratic anti-imperialist rhetoric at a time when the world is made up of a heterodox assemblage of political actors and declining U.S. hegemony. I argue, then, that there is a need for a rethinking of the ""media imperialism"" thesis of communication studies, one congruent with the vagaries and vicissitudes of global imbalances and shifting power blocs.",Venezuela,-66.58973,6.42375,2

Global and International Studies",Global and International Studies,Jan Nederveen Pieterse,"This project is about discovering how some groups are working to build participatory governance as an alternative to the established processes that produce their marginalization. Governance refers to the decision-making processes at work in a given aggregate of people or territory, along with the more material outcomes of those processes, and affects social, political, economic, and cultural spheres. Therefore, changing governance has the potential to create comprehensive, systemic changes within those aggregates of people or territory, particularly for those who have been excluded from the benefits or even protection of existing processes. With this in mind, this project seeks to explore participatory governance as one possible avenue for systemic change. The following questions guide this exploration: What is participatory governance? Can it be an effective way for marginalized peoples to create alternative systems and structures to the ones that currently oppress them? By considering two living cases of participatory governance, in Mexico and Venezuela, this paper argues that participatory governance processes better serve the immediate needs of marginalized peoples and also empower them to create alternative, emancipatory systems by changing the priorities of governance through collective decision making. These questions are explored through the writings of those who are directly impacted by the participatory processes investigated in this piece, from both Mexico and Venezuela, as well as those who may have a different kind of stake in this debate, as outside observers, and sometimes as activists in their own contexts. Following this more theoretical exploration are two in-depth case studies of living participatory governance processes: in Zapatista communities in Chiapas, a Mexican state on the border with Guatemala; and in Chavista-governed Venezuela, where twenty-first century socialism has become the official guiding governance policy. These chapters articulate the governance structures in each of the respective national contexts, and explore the products of these governance processes surrounding education, health, and equitable development, since our measure of effective governance is often tied to the collective goods it is able to provide rather than simple sets of rules and regulations. Exploring these reformulations will ideally provide insight into alternative approaches to global governance processes currently overrun by certain exclusive and unsustainable mechanisms and hegemonies. Seeking alternatives is important because we live on a planet with finite resources, a growing population with disparate levels of consumption, and a changing climate. Conflict over arable land, clean water, and other valuable resources only promises to increase in the future, as communities face desertification or soil collapse, sea level rise, and regional conflict. Decreased conflict and increased equitability seem unlikely within the current world structure, so seeking alternative forms of governance, ways of living together, and resource management, takes on a new urgency. We must not wait until it is too late.",Venezuela,-66.58973,6.42375,2

Sociology",Sociology,Kum-Kum Bhavnani,"My doctoral dissertation examines how rising seas and a recently renewed interest in the construction of seawalls illustrate a form of development that involves substantial labor, financing, and materials in addition to hidden social and environmental costs. More generally, the research looks at the moving borders of the sea driven by the complex dynamics of anthropogenic climate change in which twenty-five million to one billion people will be affected by the year 2050. I draw upon theoretical approaches that consider climate-related issues to be macro-social processes involving global and international relations as well as matters of lived experience involving people in contexts where material and cultural histories shape climate change resiliency. Using the methods of global ethnography, I address the problem of coastal vulnerability by focusing on the cultural and social dynamics of coastal development and sea change in Guyana, The Maldives, Venice and the Netherlands, highlighting issues that emerge in places where seawalls are already important fixtures in the landscape. Analysis across these sites reveals how the threat of rising seas involves multiple axes of inequality formed within the contexts of colonialism, development, and globalization over the past one hundred years. Seawalls and other coastal structures embody culturally ingrained meanings, physical demands, and financial investments that continue to shape the experiences of those who live behind them. Data was gathered from April 2012 to April 2014 in Venice, the Netherlands, Guyana and the Maldives, and included sixty-two semi-structured interviews and nine focus groups, touching upon the lived experiences of 120 people. Findings illustrate the tensions and contradictions that ground seawall development. In Guyana, sand bags and rip-rap structures line the coast in contrast to the state of the art concrete barriers found in Venice, the Netherlands, and the United States. Poor coastal villages have few options as they invest time and hope in the restoration of mangroves forests, a process that has been met with many obstacles and unexpected sacrifices. In the Maldives, one-third of the population lives on a walled island without beaches, while tourists enjoy holidays on over two hundred island resorts nearby. As seawalls become measures of last resort in the struggle to hold the line, the existing narratives of the ""sinking island"" and ""climate change refugee"" fail to capture the dynamic inequalities that exist within and between places. This study shows the need to offer different conceptualizations of rising seas in public discourses, based on an analysis of seawalls and what the people who live in and around them say as they speak out.",Venice,12.3155151,45.4408474,3

There has been little scholarly attention devoted, though, to where people with Mexican and other ethnoracial backgrounds fit within ethnoracial paradigms. Framed within historical and contemporary mestiz and multiracial identity theories, I gathered data through oral histories with Central and Northern California individuals as well as archival, oral history, and autoethnographic research on multiple generations of my Vermont family. The study contextualizes California narrators' identity formations within familial, community, and national histories to argue that, despite thorough boundary policing by monoethnically identified Mexican American and other communities, narrators inherited familial, community, cultural, sexual, and personal resources that modeled first- and multigenerational ethnoracial mixing as common and/or the integration of binaries as possible. Such models facilitated narrators' development of their own integrated mixed race, Mexican-descent identities, which they achieved by actively developing one or more of five tool patterns. The study also addresses the issue of ethnoracial identity migration, and employs an ecological approach to examine how changes in certain intersectional identity vectors (e.g., age, class, geography, and family dynamics) can lead to minor or major ethnoracial identity migrations. Furthermore, I analyze the history of ethnoracial identity over three generations of my Vermont family in terms of the models, tool patterns, and intersectional vector analyses from above, via the overarching framework of my own identity experiences.

There has been little scholarly attention devoted, though, to where people with Mexican and other ethnoracial backgrounds fit within ethnoracial paradigms. Framed within historical and contemporary mestiz and multiracial identity theories, I gathered data through oral histories with Central and Northern California individuals as well as archival, oral history, and autoethnographic research on multiple generations of my Vermont family. The study contextualizes California narrators' identity formations within familial, community, and national histories to argue that, despite thorough boundary policing by monoethnically identified Mexican American and other communities, narrators inherited familial, community, cultural, sexual, and personal resources that modeled first- and multigenerational ethnoracial mixing as common and/or the integration of binaries as possible. Such models facilitated narrators' development of their own integrated mixed race, Mexican-descent identities, which they achieved by actively developing one or more of five tool patterns. The study also addresses the issue of ethnoracial identity migration, and employs an ecological approach to examine how changes in certain intersectional identity vectors (e.g., age, class, geography, and family dynamics) can lead to minor or major ethnoracial identity migrations. Furthermore, I analyze the history of ethnoracial identity over three generations of my Vermont family in terms of the models, tool patterns, and intersectional vector analyses from above, via the overarching framework of my own identity experiences.

I track how French and German authorities sought to prevent street demonstrations and how well their efforts worked over time. I examine the difficulty in protesting under an authoritarian regime and whether demonstrations undermined public support for Vichy. Street demonstrations challenged the regime's legitimacy by questioning whether the French state could garner public support and maintain order. Collective spaces of cities offered French citizens a place to appropriate and give new meaning to everyday acts and rituals.

Education",Education,Hsiu-Zu Ho,"Results of the study showed that Southeast Asian Americans who were committed to their ethnic identities prior to college continued to explore their ethnic identities in college. Ethnic exploration occurred predominantly within social spaces, such as within ethnic student organizations. Parents' prior ethnic socialization continued to influence whether students were committed to their ethnic identities. Although participation in ethnic practices and traditions had generally declined in college, students maintained cultural beliefs and values that were conducive towards academic success and college persistence. With respect to college integration, students were generally socially integrated only within ethnic- and racial-related spaces. Contrary to what was expected, female students remained committed to their ethnic group even if they were in disagreement with their parents' and ethnic community's traditional gender expectations. Lastly, the findings suggested that choices in ethnic and racial identity labels varied across contexts and that ethnic identity was relevant to student development and possibly college success. The Southeast Asian American students' cultural identities contributed to their social integration, and that social integration supported the students' overall persistence in college. This study included individual interviews with a sample of 27 Southeast Asian American students that were all attending the same four-year university in California. Participants were recruited from campus spaces that were predicted to have a large Southeast Asian American presence. The interview guide addressed students' prior ethnic socialization experiences before entering college and also students' ethnic- and non-ethnic-based experiences since arriving to college. Participants were asked specific questions pertaining to ethnic identity exploration and commitment. Line-by-line coding was conducted on the interview transcripts and themes were organized across the interviews to address the four major research questions of the study. The perception of the high-achieving Asian American student can make invisible the challenges these students face as ethnic minorities on their college campuses. In particular, Southeast Asian American students, such as those of Cambodian, Laotian, and Vietnamese descent, encounter additional barriers because of the circumstances of their parents' migration experiences and the ethnic socialization that occurs within their families and communities. Most current research that has been conducted on Asian Americans in higher education has not focused specifically on Southeast Asian American students. As argued by Teranishi, Behringer, Grey, and Parker (2009), college student development models may not be inclusive of the experiences of Southeast Asian American students, especially since those models may not account for how academic development can intersect with students' ethnic identity development. Primarily based on Tinto's (1975) college retention model, this present study examined the college integration and ethnic identity development of a sample of Southeast Asian American undergraduate students.",Vietnam,108.277199,14.058324,6

In order to account for the colonial impact of French culture and language on Vietnamese people, I first analyze colonial and postcolonial novels and argue that even if Vietnamese authors from the 1930s until the 1980s started forging a literature of resistance in French, they still used colonial motifs to represent Vietnamese culture. In my second chapter, I introduce contemporary writers, Kim Thuy, Kim Lefevre, Anna Moi and Linda Le and build a threefold theoretical framework based on Mikhail Bakhtine's concept of heteroglossia and James Gee's sociolinguistics theory of literacy. I contend that these authors' use of French mediates their access to a multidimensional space, blurring borders of cultural and linguistic identity. Elaborating on multiple sub-identities, I then analyze the works of the novelist Linda Le, which exemplify the heteroglossic and carnivalesque novelistic language, which Bakhtin analyzed in The Dialogic Imagination. I argue that her use of dialogism allows her to challenge social norms and give an aesthetic form to the experience of writing in exile. Finally, in my fourth chapter, I demonstrate the ways in which Anna Moi reconstructs Vietnam's colonial history, manipulates the figure of the ethnic Other, and performs hybrid forms of linguistic and artistic expression in order to oppose social, cultural, and ethnic boundaries, and insert Vietnamese culture and people into a narrative escaping the constraints of colonial representations.",Vietnam,108.277199,14.058324,6

History",History,Lisa Jacobson,"This dissertation explores how the adoption of foreign children from Greece, Korea, and Vietnam to the United States moved beyond an emergency response in the 1940s to become an American institution by the 1970s. The rise of international adoption came as the United States was trying to redefine itself as a nation. The transfer of needy children across ethnic, racial, and national lines promised to bridge the developed and developing world, humanizing relations between countries while reinforcing the United States as an exceptional humanitarian power. This dissertation argues that the institutionalization of intercountry adoptions enabled the United States to extend its political and cultural reach into intimate family relationships beyond its national boundaries. Driven by the demand for new ""markets"" of ""adoptable"" babies, some legislators, adoptive parents, social workers, the private adoption sector, and the media used international adoption as a way to tell a story about their nation as a benevolent power that used its authority to throw off colonial structures of racism and hegemony. In so doing, the United States built a new kind of empire---a ""colorblind empire""---to legitimize foreign children's place in U.S. families. As this dissertation contends, the colorblind empire's logistical success depended on the interaction of state institutions and private agencies. The efforts of private organizations and individuals to promote international adoption succeeded because the federal government expanded immigration policies, limited the regulation of adoption markets, and protected the private sector's policymaking. The advocacy of adoptive parents through political lobbying, interest groups, memoirs, and media campaigns further strengthened the cultural authority and institutional clout of the emerging private international adoption sector. The lens of adoption unites several key themes in twentieth-century American history. Following a foreign orphan's path to the United States changes the trajectories of immigration history and child welfare policy as part of the larger welfare state. It explains how foreign orphans shaped conceptions of racial difference. It alters the image of a homogenous 1950s American family. It reveals how international adoption became the safest kind of nation-building platform, silencing critics that labeled the United States an empire.",Vietnam,108.277199,14.058324,6

Literary modernism's presentation of human fragility amidst exhausted environments challenged problematic industrial and imperial narratives of unlimited progress and generated new modes of ecological awareness in the 20th century. Faced with the restless and inescapable forces of modernization, modernist writers shifted away from the withdrawn, ""restful contemplation"" of the Romantics and moved towards an increasingly materialist attention to the world as an immersive stream of human and nonhuman connections that are interdependent and hierarchical in problematic ways. The Anglophone novel, as it develops through D. H.

Spanish and Portuguese",Spanish and Portuguese,Sara Poot-Herrera,"During the time period studied, religious liberty and Catholicism's role as a unifying force in Spanish society and an essential element of Spanish identity are fervently contested topics. The historical vicissitudes of the period---an unsuccessful attempt to introduce religious freedom during the Bienio Liberal (1854-56), the Revolution of 1868 and introduction of religious freedom in the Constitution of 1869, the evanescent First Spanish Republic, the restoration of the Bourbon monarchy and limiting of religious freedoms in the Constitution of 1876---frame the presence of competing ideologies. In this context, Protestant missionaries and colporteurs actively proselytize in Spain, a generation of Spanish Protestant leaders emerges, and the first congregations are established. In chapters dedicated to each author, the study investigates the representation of the Protestant ""other"", utilizing categories developed by Tzvetan Todorov to describe the encounter with the religious subaltern in the New World. While examining the function of Protestants in the texts, the study also compares and contrasts the literary figures with historical representatives of the period. The dissertation reveals that similar responses toward the Protestant ""other"" emerge in authors of different ideological persuasions and literary commitments. Whether informed by costumbrismo, romanticism, realism or naturalism, the novels inevitably advance the authors' ideological commitments, misrepresent the religious other, and/or dismiss Protestantism as a legitimate religious alternative.

This dissertation picks up an old academic (marxian) conversation about problem for capitalist enterprises of the ""limits of capitalist agriculture"" and reinvigorates the conversation by including a historical narrative that centers workers and their contributions towards changing the agricultural industry in Washington via consistent refusal, movement, strikes, and boycotts as well as extending the struggle over the places that Mexicans settled and against deportation and racial profiling. Madrigal uses this systematically collected data on the trends of two of the state's largest agricultural corporate enterprises, this dissertation documents that Broetje Orchards broke a United Farm Workers of Washington strike in the mid 1990s and the other, Sakuma Brothers Farm, was unable to break a strike campaign that began 2013 when Familias Unidas por la Justicia, a democratic idependent farmworker union was formed and began a campaign for a union contract. This study demonstrates that when the geography of struggle is extended over the larger capitalist market circuit of the Pacific Rim and rather than focus on a temporal moment for Mexican workers, we can see that collectively the workers have been prevailing in the long run. This runs contrary to the dominant narrative that farm workers are docile or do not want unions that represent their interests collectively against even larger multi-national enterprises that source the products of their labor from their employers. This dissertation strives to be a tool in the hands of the farmworkers who shared their life histories and experiences. In as much, it presents a map of the history and modes of production of their employers and organizes it in a manner that might be as useful for future struggles as Marcos F. Lopez UC Santa Cruz dissertation ""Places in Production: Nature, Farm Work and Farm Worker Resistance in U.S. and Mexican Strawberry Growing Regions"" (2011) on Driscoll's that narrated many of the same experiences that the farmworkers engaged in this dissertation and later provided the common ground that made relationships between Familias Unidas por la Justicia and the Allianza de Organizaciones Nacional, Estatal y Municipal por la Justicia Social a sister democrative independent farm worker union in Baja California even stronger. Even the reluctantly supportive Seth Holmes' second chapter in ""Fresh Fruit, Broken Bodies: Migrant Farmworkers in the United States"" (2013) which overlaps in documenting some of the same farmworkers that helped draft this study (FUJ member Carmen Juarez is featured on the cover of his book), helped form a campaign that helped defeat Sakuma Brothers Farm which is the subject of his and this study.

Chicana and Chicano Studies",Chicana and Chicano Studies,"Miroslava Chavez-Garcia, Dolores I. Casillas","My research examines early twentieth-century immigration policies focusing on the experience of ""repatriation"" that tore apart Mexican and Mexican American families throughout the United States. It considers this historical moment as the ""banishment"" of U.S. citizens of Mexican descent to foreground the difference between repatriation, which implies that the person is not a citizen of a given country and banishment, referring to citizens who are banned from their home country. This discursive difference challenges much of the literature that refers to these banishments as ""repatriations"", obscuring the systematic racist and exclusionist immigration policies. The legal, social, and cultural ramifications of banishment on second and third generation descendants of U.S. citizens are largely absent in Chicana/o-Latina/o historiographies and immigration legal studies. My work takes an innovative approach in that it focuses on the prolonged consequences of immigration policies on surviving banished U.S. citizens and their descendants and the link to today's growing legally mixed-status households across the United States. My study demonstrates that U.S. immigration policies continue to ignore the long and complex Mexico-U.S. immigration relations, failing to create adequate paths to legalization for old and new generations of Mexican immigrants. This study centers on the experiences of banishment of three extended families and uses their oral histories across multiple generations to recover and rewrite the history of forced exclusion. The families are composed of surviving U.S. citizens who were banished during the early twentieth century and/or who are descendants of those survivors who have returned to the United States, some as undocumented immigrants. The participating families include the Yanez family, residing in Anaheim, California; the Molina family, spread throughout California, Alabama, and Mexico; and the Robles family, living in Pasadena, California. To allow for personal accounts as well as communal- or family-based interpretations, each family member is interviewed individually and then the entire family is interviewed collectively, providing for a multiplicity of insights and richly texture points of views. In addition to oral histories, this study mines the families' archives, which are composed of photographs, letters, and legal records detailing the experiences of banishment over the course of the twentieth century. Institutional records, including legal histories, archival materials, and demographic data housed at the National Archives in Washington D.C. and the regional branches in Los Angeles, California, as well as El Paso, Texas are used to contextualize the primary research and to reconstruct and reinterpret the immigration policies of the time. My study indicates that these families experienced repatriation in very unique ways, but with a common sense of contempt that extends across family generations, and continue to face real legal and social collateral consequences. My findings demonstrate that an almost 90-year-old unofficial, later becoming official, policy continues to classify direct descendents of banished U.S. citizens as ""illegal"" immigrants in their parents and grandparents' home country. Banishment has resulted in what I term, a transgenerational illegality, which has been nearly impossible to shake. These findings are crucial at a time where immigration remains central to national debates. The twenty original oral histories collected for this study demonstrate that, despite the subjugation of these families, the descendants found ways to challenge their ""illegal"" status, giving rise to the concept of a contested illegality..",Washington,-120.7401385,47.7510741,5

Environmental Science and Management",Environmental Science and Management,Frank Davis,"Residential development is now a major contributor to land surface change in the U.S. From 1990 - 2000, over thirteen million housing units were added to the nation's housing stock which stood at 102.3 million in 1990. Another 15.8 million housing units were added from 2000 - 2010. Of particular concern is the ongoing increase in low-density residential development because of its large resource footprint and biodiversity impacts. In this dissertation I pose three broad questions 1) What were the trends in residential development in the U.S. from 1990 - 2000? 2) What were the trends in rural conversion to low-density residential use from 1990 - 2000 in the Mid-Atlantic and the Pacific Northwest and what social and environmental factors help explain these trends? 3) What were the effects of rural conversion to residential use on vegetation productivity in the Mid-Atlantic and the Pacific Northwest from 2000 - 2010? To answer these questions I created a database derived from U.S. Census blocks that allows for interdecadal comparison of recent housing density change in support of spatial demographic research. In a series of GIS based analyses I used the database to map changes in metropolitan housing density distributions in the Mid-Atlantic and western Washington regions and used a satellite derived index of vegetation productivity to assess the impacts of housing growth on vegetation carbon uptake. Results indicate that residential housing growth is more dynamic than previously thought and established approaches for mapping housing density tend to underestimate the local intensity of residential change. In the Mid-Atlantic and western Washington, low-density residential development is affecting large fractions of rural landscapes in metropolitan areas. The strongest correlates of low-density conversion of rural landscapes were population growth and extent of protected lands, suggesting future directions for modeling the drivers of rural conversion. Residential development in the rural landscapes of the Mid-Atlantic and western Washington reduced mean and maximum vegetation productivity from 2000 - 2010. The influence of residential development on maximum productivity was particularly evident in Mid-Atlantic deciduous forests. As a whole the findings reveal continued metropolitan decentralization which is associated with reductions of vegetation productivity in forest ecosystems of the Mid-Atlantic and western Washington.",Washington,-120.7401385,47.7510741,5

History",History,John Majewski,"Andrew Jackson's conflict with the Second Bank of the United States (BUS), often portrayed as a ""Bank war"" involving questions of class, ideology, and personality, endures as one of the most significant political events in the antebellum era. In this dissertation, I offer a new interpretation stressing how national, public-private institutions---banks, newspapers, and bureaucratic agencies---shaped party development and public opinion. Reconceptualizing the Bank war, I focus on newspaper editors as central actors who helped craft the hyper-charged rhetoric of the Jacksonian era, as businessmen who blended public and private finance, and as crucial middle men who transmitted political ideas to voters. Amos Kendall, an editor and treasury department official who utilized state powers to build the Democratic Party and destroy the BUS, epitomized the lesser-known figures who gave the Bank war its distinct flavor. This approach contextualizes the Bank war within the transportation and communications revolution, and challenges the conventional understanding of the early United States as a ""weak state."" In assessing the power of the state, I am concerned principally with institutions and bureaucratic agencies like the Post Office, and how these agencies interacted with civil society, the press, and private enterprise. Leading newspapers in the Bank war, especially the Washington Globe and National Intelligencer, received subsidies from Congress and executive department agencies. The Post Office controlled a vast network of political patronage, hired editors as postmasters, and shaped public opinion by determining the speed and accuracy of newspaper delivery. The agency's power may have exceeded that of the BUS, which implemented a feckless, half-hearted, and inconsistent media strategy. Newspapers and letters comprise the bulk of this project's primary source base.

History",History,John Majewski,"Andrew Jackson's conflict with the Second Bank of the United States (BUS), often portrayed as a ""Bank war"" involving questions of class, ideology, and personality, endures as one of the most significant political events in the antebellum era. In this dissertation, I offer a new interpretation stressing how national, public-private institutions---banks, newspapers, and bureaucratic agencies---shaped party development and public opinion. Reconceptualizing the Bank war, I focus on newspaper editors as central actors who helped craft the hyper-charged rhetoric of the Jacksonian era, as businessmen who blended public and private finance, and as crucial middle men who transmitted political ideas to voters. Amos Kendall, an editor and treasury department official who utilized state powers to build the Democratic Party and destroy the BUS, epitomized the lesser-known figures who gave the Bank war its distinct flavor. This approach contextualizes the Bank war within the transportation and communications revolution, and challenges the conventional understanding of the early United States as a ""weak state."" In assessing the power of the state, I am concerned principally with institutions and bureaucratic agencies like the Post Office, and how these agencies interacted with civil society, the press, and private enterprise. Leading newspapers in the Bank war, especially the Washington Globe and National Intelligencer, received subsidies from Congress and executive department agencies. The Post Office controlled a vast network of political patronage, hired editors as postmasters, and shaped public opinion by determining the speed and accuracy of newspaper delivery. The agency's power may have exceeded that of the BUS, which implemented a feckless, half-hearted, and inconsistent media strategy.

Chicana and Chicano studies",Chicana and Chicano studies,"Juan V. Palerm, Aida Hurtado","Picking up on the Mexican experience in the Pacific Northwest at the end of the Bracero program which has been narrated by Erasmo Gamboa (2000) and more recently by Mario Jimenez Sifuentez (2016), Madrigal uses oral history interviews, ethnography, family history, archival and government data to narrate the experience of Mexican farmworkers in Washington State from 1964 to 2013. This dissertation picks up an old academic (marxian) conversation about problem for capitalist enterprises of the ""limits of capitalist agriculture"" and reinvigorates the conversation by including a historical narrative that centers workers and their contributions towards changing the agricultural industry in Washington via consistent refusal, movement, strikes, and boycotts as well as extending the struggle over the places that Mexicans settled and against deportation and racial profiling. Madrigal uses this systematically collected data on the trends of two of the state's largest agricultural corporate enterprises, this dissertation documents that Broetje Orchards broke a United Farm Workers of Washington strike in the mid 1990s and the other, Sakuma Brothers Farm, was unable to break a strike campaign that began 2013 when Familias Unidas por la Justicia, a democratic idependent farmworker union was formed and began a campaign for a union contract. This study demonstrates that when the geography of struggle is extended over the larger capitalist market circuit of the Pacific Rim and rather than focus on a temporal moment for Mexican workers, we can see that collectively the workers have been prevailing in the long run. This runs contrary to the dominant narrative that farm workers are docile or do not want unions that represent their interests collectively against even larger multi-national enterprises that source the products of their labor from their employers. This dissertation strives to be a tool in the hands of the farmworkers who shared their life histories and experiences. In as much, it presents a map of the history and modes of production of their employers and organizes it in a manner that might be as useful for future struggles as Marcos F. Lopez UC Santa Cruz dissertation ""Places in Production: Nature, Farm Work and Farm Worker Resistance in U.S. and Mexican Strawberry Growing Regions"" (2011) on Driscoll's that narrated many of the same experiences that the farmworkers engaged in this dissertation and later provided the common ground that made relationships between Familias Unidas por la Justicia and the Allianza de Organizaciones Nacional, Estatal y Municipal por la Justicia Social a sister democrative independent farm worker union in Baja California even stronger. Even the reluctantly supportive Seth Holmes' second chapter in ""Fresh Fruit, Broken Bodies: Migrant Farmworkers in the United States"" (2013) which overlaps in documenting some of the same farmworkers that helped draft this study (FUJ member Carmen Juarez is featured on the cover of his book), helped form a campaign that helped defeat Sakuma Brothers Farm which is the subject of his and this study. It is for this reason that the growers and multi-national enterprises that source from them are named as it makes the matter of cross referencing in the future easier for union researchers.",Washington State,-120.7401385,47.7510741,5

Geography",Geography,Michael F. Goodchild,"How might risk perception and risk factors influence the spread of disease? To answer this question, we must first understand how risk perception influences risk-taking behaviors that result in an increased susceptibility to infection. Risk factors classified as behavioral and medical also contribute to susceptibility. This research explores the dynamics of tuberculosis disease spread in West Kenya. Behaviors associated with tuberculosis are complex and driven by a number of factors as evidenced by the current body of knowledge. A literature review on the role of tuberculosis perception, with an emphasis on perceived causes and modes of transmission, highlights this fact. To encapsulate decisions, this research explores one behavioral consequence of risk perception: avoidance. The act of accepting risk based on some utility to interact with a known infected individual can, in some cases, be identified as risk attenuation. In other cases, an individual may have little control over whom they interact with and when. To explore how these dynamics may influence the spread of tuberculosis; an agent-based model was employed. West Kenya was chosen to test the model due to its increasing rates of newly diagnosed tuberculosis cases and the identification of several multidrug-resistant cases. HIV and tuberculosis co-infections are also of particular concern for health officials in Kenya and many other parts of the world. Avoidance as a way to reduce contact with infectious individuals did not show a favorable result in the simulated population, and additional experiments to explore the potential consequences of an increased stigmatization of the disease brought about by widespread avoidance further produced unfavorable results. Due to crowding, avoidance did little to reduce initial infections, yet a scaling effect was identified as a limitation. More favorable results were found when other risk factors associated with tuberculosis were reduced, effectively simulating a more resilient population able to fight off initial infection and transition to the infectious active stage of the disease. Finally, an exploration of better treatment compliance and the outcomes for a shorter treatment option showed the greatest impact on the simulated population. While education campaigns may be necessary to increase the overall understanding of tuberculosis within the population, efforts to strengthen the population against initial infection and furthering the development of shorter treatment options that improve treatment compliance will have the greatest positive impact on the population.",West Kenya,37.906193,-0.023559,1

Sociology",Sociology,"William I. Robinson, Juan-Vicente Palerm","This dissertation examines the interplay between processes of globalization and transnational migration and their impact at the micro level in the understudied area of gendered household economic strategies in both sending and receiving communities. Drawing on a multi-sited ethnography study which employed a two-phase mixed methods approach, I analyzed migration histories, occupational mobility, migration dispersion in the U.S., and household economic strategies, in two transnational communities: 1) Acayahualco, Guerrero Mexico and Santa Barbara, CA and 2) Mayanalan, Guerrero Mexico and Wilmington, DE. To ascertain key socio-demographic features of the populations under study, I developed a 162-item survey that I administered to 90 households in the sending communities of Guerrero, Mexico. The survey results were both complemented and challenged by my multi-sited ethnographic research comprising 50 in-depth interviews, along with participant observation in the sending and receiving communities. This study offers two contributions to sociology: in the one hand it examines the ways in which globalization takes place at the local level, specifically in the social context of international migration. By undertaking this type of dialectic analysis of the global and the local, this study sheds light on the individual's response capabilities and, more importantly, on their agency power in the face of global processes. This proactive agency on the part of the transnational migrant families becomes evident as they are observed looking constantly for ways to ""stretch their limited resources"" to cover expenses by relying on their unlimited resourcefulness. In this context, international migration should not be viewed simply as a survival strategy for peasant families, but, as a mechanism of reaction and resistance against global capitalism barriers. On the other hand, I demonstrated throughout this work, the social phenomenon of international migration in these two communities, and within their domestic units, is the result of an accumulative and uninterrupted process that has been shaped by a vast number of learning experiences, social and cultural exchanges, and innovative and resourceful practices to cope with the challenges of becoming transnational. The transnational perspective allows us to underscore how, in spite of being physically separated by great distances, the development of household economic strategies by migrants and their families are deeply linked. This transnational linkage allows migrants and their families in their communities of origins to cope with the challenges of a globalized economy that has been detrimental to their living conditions. In this sense, the results of my study counter the view that sees migrants and their families in their communities of origin as puppets controlled by forces beyond their own control. Rather, this study emphasizes how migrants and their families with hard-working ethics look for opportunities to improve their socioeconomic circumstances and enhance their living conditions.",Wilmington,-75.5398,39.7391,1

Music",Music,Scott L. Marcus,"Milwaukee, Wisconsin, boasts a vibrant Irish traditional music and dance community. Spurred on by a strong dance scene, numerous pub sessions, the cultural and educational influence of Milwaukee Irish Fest and its Summer School, and the transnational circulation of performers and audio recordings, local traditional musicians have developed considerable skills, as well as strong personal and collective styles. In a number of cases, musicians associate themselves, through the style and repertoire of their playing, with specific regional styles of traditional music in Ireland, such as those of County Donegal or Sliabh Luachra (Counties Cork and Kerry). It is remarkable, however, that with perhaps only a single exception, these musicians are not from the areas with which they stylistically associate themselves or even from Ireland itself. Rather, they are for the most part natives of Southeastern Wisconsin who have been introduced to Irish traditional music in the context of late 20 th century revival movements. How then have they come to associate themselves with localized performance styles from Ireland? This thesis analyzes these stylistic associations in terms of the repertory requirements of local dancing, opportunities to hear and be educated in regional styles by visiting musicians, and the availability of stylistically diverse audio recordings. This paper speaks to the ways in which local musics are globalized, but then socially re-localized through affinity-based musical practices, and is based on my extended local involvement as a musician from 2004 onwards, as well as ethnographic fieldwork from 2009 to 2010.",Wisconsin,-88.7878678,43.7844397,2

Communication",Communication,Cynthia Stohl,"Climate change attitudes have been explained with a variety of factors, including cultural worldviews, environmental attitudes, political ideology, knowledge of climate change, severe weather exposure, and sociodemographic characteristics. These approaches, however, assume that an individual forms attitudes on the basis of preexisting values or beliefs and do not account for dynamic social interaction as a source of influence. This study introduces a network perspective that accounts for the social embeddedness of individuals, using key relational and structural network variables to predict climate attitudes. This study explores the relationships between climate attitudes and the following social network variables: homophily, network strength, attitude diversity, centrality, network size, and network valence. Climate change attitudes were developed from an exploratory factor analysis, which identified climate change skepticism and belief strength as distinct attitudinal dimensions. Using egocentric data from a nationally representative Knowledge Networks survey collected for the Yale Project on Climate Change Communication in 2011, this study found that network variables were significant in predicting both climate attitude dimensions. Using hierarchical regression analyses that accounted for other known predictors of climate attitudes, this study determined that homophily, network strength, attitude diversity, and network valence were significant predictors of skepticism (R2change=4.8%), while centrality and network strength were predictive of belief strength (R 2change=8.9%). A multinomial logistic regression also determined that strong accepters have the most active communication styles, exhibiting the highest homophily, network strength, and centrality in their personal networks. Directions for future network research and practical applications are discussed.",Yale,-72.9223431,41.3163244,2

Music",Music,David C. Paul,"This dissertation explores how music came to be accepted in late-nineteenth-century American university curricula as an element of what historian Laurence Veysey has called the liberal culture reform movement. Proponents of liberal culture focused on advancing the classically derived studies of language, philosophy, literature, and the arts in order to nurture students' sense of refined culture. Using research processes from intellectual history, I place music in the constantly shifting discourse surrounding university arts curricula. I show how proponents for music in higher education borrowed not only rhetoric from the liberal culture reform movement, but from a number of competing reform movements in an effort to legitimize music as an academic subject. I use sociological theories of institutionalism to show how this discourse influenced the architects of prestigious music programs. Furthermore, I examine the importance of women and gender on the establishment of music in American universities. I argue that it was ultimately the collaboration between sympathetic administrators and composers-turned-professors that shaped the foundation of music in the modern American university. To this end, I use three case studies that chronicle the development of music programs at three influential American universities. The first of these is centered on Harvard professor John Knowles Paine, who worked closely with President Charles W. Eliot to build a program that emphasized the role of music in a cultural education within the new elective system. The second case study revolves around composer Horatio Parker. The Yale professor prioritized the study of music composition while establishing a School of Music that offered applied instruction and a number of general education opportunities. The final case study is a culminating moment in the acceptance of music as a university discipline. Composer and Columbia professor Edward MacDowell envisioned music as part of an interdisciplinary department of fine arts that would include literature, sculpture, painting, and architecture. After MacDowell's controversial resignation due to disagreements with President Nicholas Murray Butler, discourse about music in higher education was reinvigorated. This time, however, it figured in a larger debate concerning idealism and materialism in the university and reached beyond the confines of the humanities.",Yale,-72.9223431,41.3163244,2

Feminist Studies",Feminist Studies,Grace Chang,"My main research questions explore how contradictions of unity, organizing structures, gender, sexuality, citizenship, class, and ability are addressed within Filipino leftist organizations that utilize dialectical materialist theory. I also ask: How have US-based women of color feminist and queer of color theory impacted Filipino nationalist frameworks in the US? How do they also remain at odds with one another? I interviewed 21 NYC-based activists and organizers involved in anti-imperialist Filipino organizations the summer of 2012. I also used participant observation as an active member of study groups, educational workshops, and a town forum. My central framework explores conflict as contradiction using Mao Tse-tung's ""On Contradiction"" and the Haitian concepts of balans and konesans. In doing so, I examine how hard-lined leadership has impeded dialogue. I also interrogate how sexism, transphobia, masculinist organizing structures, and neoliberalism impact women, trans, queer, disabled, working class, and undocumented organizers---particularly those with overlapping identities of marginalization. ""The Movement's"" familial dynamic, combined with the value of utang na loob, creates hierarchies that cause some members to feel both silenced and guilty. I name these feelings as indicators of invisible emotional labor ""for the sake of the movement"" that lead many members to eventually leave their organizations. Their departures raise questions of sustainability. Lastly, I ask how the Fil-Am Left can draw strength from its familial dynamic but still address hierarchical issues that mirror societal hierarchies of oppression. Applying work by Patricia Hill Collins, Audre Lorde, and other women of color, along with feminist grounded theory and sociological movement theory, I highlight three strategies that New York City based Filipino organizations have taken within the past ten years. I argue that organizations have recognized problems with sustainability and are creating their own interventions as theory-producers. Organizers' relationships to the National Democratic movement in the Philippines shape both the creation of interventions and how they respond to new ideas. Drawing on Arlie Hoschchild's concept of ""stalled revolution,"" individual behaviors lag behind organizations' formal ideological shifts.

Computer Science",Computer Science,Elizabeth Belding,"While access to Internet and cellular connectivity is easily achieved in densely-populated areas, provisioning of communication services is much more challenging in remote rural areas. At the same time Internet access is of critical importance to residents of such rural communities. People's curiosity and realization of the opportunities provided by Internet and cellular access is the key ingredient to adoption. However, poor network performance can easily impede the process of adoption by discouraging people to access and use connectivity. With this in mind, we evaluate performance and adoption of various connectivity technologies in rural developing regions and identify avenues that need immediate attention to guarantee smoother technology adoption. In light of this analysis we propose novel system designs that meet these needs. Internet connectivity in rural areas is typically provided through slow satellite links. The challenges in performance and adoption of such networks have been previously studied. We add a unique dataset and consequent analysis to this spectrum of work, which captures the upgrade of the gateway connectivity in the rural community of Macha, Zambia from a 256kbps satellite link to a more capable 2Mbps terrestrial link. We show that the improvement in performance and user experience is not necessarily proportional to the bandwidth increase. While this increase improved the network usability, it also opened opportunities for adoption of more demanding services that were previously out of reach. As a result the network performance was severely degraded over the long term. To address these challenges we employ white space communication both for connectivity to more capable remote gateways, as well as for end user connectivity. We develop VillageLink, a distributed method that optimizes channel allocation to maximize throughput and enables both remote gateway access as well as end user coverage. While VillageLink features lightweight channel probing, we also consider external sources of channel availability. We design a novel approach for estimation of channel occupancy called TxMiner, which is capable of extracting transmitter characteristics from raw spectrum measurements. In this thesis we focus on cellular and broadband Internet connectivity. Commercial cellular networks are highly centralized, which requires costly backhaul. This, coupled with high price for equipment, maintenance and licensing renders cellular network access commercially-infeasible in rural areas. At the same time rural cellular communications are highly local: 70% of the rural-residential calls have an originator-destination pair within the same antenna. In line with this observation we design a low-cost cellular network architecture dubbed Kwiizya, to provide local voice and text messaging services in a rural community. Where outbound connectivity is available, Kwiizya can provide global services. While commercial networks are becoming more available in rural areas they are often out of financial reach of rural residents. Furthermore, these networks typically provide only basic voice and SMS services and no mobile data. To address these challenges, our proposed work allows Kwiizya to operate in coexistence with commercial cellular networks in order to extend local coverage and provide more advanced services that are not delivered by the commercial networks. We study the adoption and implications of network connectivity in rural communities. In line with the results of our analyses we design and build system architectures that are geared to meet critical needs in these communities. While the focus of analysis in this thesis is on rural sub-Saharan Africa, the proposed designs and system implementations are more general and can serve in infrastructure-challenged communities across the world.",Zambia,27.849332,-13.133897,1

It outlines the importance of wartime experience in explaining the surge in post-war migration to southern Africa. It then traces the role of migration in the attempt to reinvent empire as Commonwealth in the decades after the Second World War as the British government encouraged migration to the Dominions and Southern Rhodesia despite a labor shortage. Using debates surrounding immigration, it highlights the tensions in South Africa and Southern Rhodesia as minority settler colonial regimes between gaining more white population and ensuring racial prestige in the 1940s and 1950s.Though always determined by race, by the 1960s, selective policies based on nationality and class gave way to more aggressive recruitment of immigrants defined by these states as white as a demographic defense of minority rule in a rapidly decolonizing continent. Though such efforts bore limited results in war torn Rhodesia, South Africa saw a dramatic increase of European and particularly British migration from the 1960s to the early 1980s. Alongside this political and demographic study, it uses migrant oral histories, biographies and letters to reveal the ongoing personal and familial ties between these nations and Britain, and the persistence of imperial migration networks even after the collapse of formal empire. Challenging the characterization of South African republic in 1961 and the Rhodesian Unilateral Declaration of Independence in 1965 as sharp breaks with the United Kingdom, this dissertation adds to a growing literature complicating the chronology of decolonization.",Zimbabwe,29.154857,-19.015438,1
