            <p>I'm curious to see how politics influence people on their reading materials. If we search the name of the current
                president Donald Trump on Amazon books, we can find as many as six pages of results. He co-authored most
                of these books. I believe that if people are curious about their presidential candidate, frequent library
                visitors might be interested in book by him or about him. </p>
            <p>Trump's campaign started in June 2015 and since then he has been a frequent visitor of media headlines. I assume
                that a correlation between major milestones during his campaign and the checked-in/out records of his books
                in the Seattle Public Library.

            <p>This is the initial sketch when I tried to figure out how to present information from four different sources:
                Seattle Public Library, Google Trend, Campaign Milestones and Time magazine covers on a single timeline.
                I realized that if all these elements have to stay on the same plane, then what I can bring to make this
                flat plane more vivid is some interactive effects, like actions triggered by mouse movements.</p>
