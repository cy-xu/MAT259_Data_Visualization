            <br>
            <p>Based on the 2D version of Trump's campaign, I converted the information on a flat surface to be shown on two
                surfaces and extended to three viewing angles to cover all four sections. </p>
            <p>Since the theory is based on Seattle Public Library's checking records, now all three other sources of information
                - Google Trend, Campaign Events (including major events one year in office) and Time magazine covers, can
                be compared with the library's bar graph (which will be placed by more creative representation in the future).</p>

            <p>I found many projects using free-view mouse interaction often lead to confusion. The reason that I constrained
                the viewing angle is actually making the information easier to be shown. There is no learning curve since
                the user can only move the move in two directions, X and Y. So I designed three areas - the top 20% of the
                screen fix the viewing angle in the top view, the middle 30% fix the viewing angle in the overlook view and
                the bottom 20% fix the viewing angle in the lower angle. So that the user can move on the X axis stress free.</p>

                The original work was designed to be controlled with mouse, but I wanted to try a hand / motion based interactive for a visualization
                work. This seems to be a suitable case for its straightforward controls designs.
            </p>
            <p>
                To achieve motion control through hand or body gesture, a motion detection method was applied in the background. A position
                calculated based on hand movement (or any body part) replaced the cursor position and achieved the camera
                control via hand / body movement as demoed in the video above.
